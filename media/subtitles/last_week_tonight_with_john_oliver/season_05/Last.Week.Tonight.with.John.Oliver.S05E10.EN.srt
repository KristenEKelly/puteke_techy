00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,400
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,080
SEASON V,
EPISODE 10

3
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,200
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,440
Thank you so much for joining us.
Time for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,920
Which has once again been chaotic,
from a volcano erupting in Hawaii,

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,720
to Kanye West implying slavery
was a choice,

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,640
to Paul Ryan picking a fight with the
House Chaplain for some reason,

8
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,480
to Trump speaking at the NRA
convention about knife crime in London

9
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,480
in extremely vivid terms.

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,880
There's blood all over the floors
of this hospital.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,560
They say it's as bad
as a military war zone hospital.

12
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,480
Knives, knives, knives.

13
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,640
What are you doing ?
He may not be presidential material,

14
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,560
but slap a black mock turtleneck on him
and his slam poetry is on point.

15
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,120
"Knives, knives, knives."

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,000
"Forks, forks, forks.
Spoooooooons."

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,920
Let's move on to West Virginia.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,400
The state whose seal seems
to commemorate

19
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,480
Papa Smurf's death
in the Civil War.

20
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,840
It's a little red Smurf hat on a grave
that says "June 20, 1863."

21
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,000
What else
could that possibly mean ?

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,840
One of West Virginia's Senate
seats is up for grabs.

23
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,440
The polls are close,
with 24 percent of voters undecided.

24
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,760
One candidate in particular
has been grabbing headlines.

25
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,160
The newest candidate in this race is
hoping that Republican Primary voters

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,800
are redemption minded
because he just got out of prison.

27
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,920
That's right, I present to you,

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,640
your newest West Virginia
Senate candidate O.J. Simpson !

29
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,680
I'm kidding !

30
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,080
The juice is not running.

31
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,360
The candidate in question is this guy:
Don Blankenship,

32
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,440
who used to run a coal company
called Massey Energy,

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,800
which is surprising, he does look more
like the butler for a family of ghosts.

34
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,320
We've discussed Blankenship before.
One of his company's mines

35
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,720
had an explosion in 2010
that killed 29 workers.

36
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,040
Blankenship denies responsibility,
but he was convicted of conspiring

37
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,760
to violate federal safety standards
in the wake of that disaster,

38
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,520
and served a year in prison.

39
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,320
If you think
that he would want

40
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,360
to steer away from any talk
of what I said in his ads, think again.

41
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,360
Did you know Don Blankenship's trial
was not about the mine explosion ?

42
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,560
You sure ?

43
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,480
The Obama judge wouldn't even
let Don mention the explosion.

44
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,280
The Obama prosecutors knew Don
had nothing to do with the explosion.

45
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,640
West Virginians knew that Obama
was against them and coal.

46
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,840
Now they understand what happened
when Don fought back.

47
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,280
- I'm voting for Don.
- Now that I know the truth, me too.

48
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,960
Cool. Of the insane things
in that ad,

49
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,840
from that man clearly drinking
from an empty coffee mug,

50
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,840
to the term "Obama judge",
perhaps the weirdest

51
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,440
is that all those two people
seem to need to know

52
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,040
in order to vote for Blankenship
is that he didn't blow up a mine.

53
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,320
They may have said, "is Don
Blankenship the golden state killer ?"

54
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,040
"No, they caught that guy !"

55
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,120
"That's all I need to know
I'm voting for Don ! Cheers."

56
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,320
If Blankenship wants to distance
himself from that mine explosion,

57
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,640
it frankly doesn't help
that he talks about it all the time.

58
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,440
He released another ad,
adding on a bizarre swipe

59
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,080
at Senate Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell.

60
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,440
And I will warn you: this man
is dangerously charismatic.

61
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,880
Politicians are running
a lot of crazy ads.

62
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,800
They blew up the coal mine
and then put me in prison.

63
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,160
Now they're running ads to say the coal
mine blew up and I went to prison.

64
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,840
There's no surprise there.
But if you want jobs,

65
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,760
if you want to end the drug epidemic
and you want to protect the unborn,

66
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,920
vote for me.

67
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,520
One of my goals as U.S. Senator
will be to ditch "Cocaine Mitch."

68
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,880
Voting for me,
you're voting for the sake of the kids.

69
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,840
Yeah, he called Mitch McConnell
"Cocaine Mitch,"

70
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,840
which is a far more badass name
than this man deserves.

71
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,280
It'd be like if we started calling her
"Julie 'Skullfucker' Andrews."

72
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,760
I don't think the name works.

73
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,320
As for where "Cocaine Mitch"
comes from,

74
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,280
it is both complicated and dumb.

75
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,880
McConnell's father-in-law, James Chao,
owns a shipping company,

76
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,360
and cocaine may have been found
on one of his company's ships.

77
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,520
But Blankenship
is clearly concerned about Chao.

78
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,200
Because he made headlines recently,
saying,

79
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,000
"I have an issue when the father-in-law
is a wealthy Chinaperson."

80
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,040
Which on one hand is pretty racist.

81
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,600
But on the other hand, it's also
impressively gender-neutral.

82
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,360
So maybe that should be
his campaign platform.

83
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,880
Don Blankenship:
Bringing racism into the 21st century.

84
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,400
But far from backing down
from that term,

85
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,280
Blankenship defended it,
in his signature style.

86
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,840
I don't see this insinuation
by the press

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,280
that there's something racist
about saying a Chinaperson.

88
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,680
Some are Korean persons
and some of them are African persons.

89
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,400
It's not any slander there.

90
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,880
Except no one has ever used
any of those phrases, ever.

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,120
And "African persons" sounds
like an album that Paul Simon made

92
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,160
that the record label absolutely,
positively refused to release.

93
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,320
I know that it's tempting to write
Blankenship off as a, a wacky outlier,

94
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,760
but the truth is, when a party moves as
far to the right as Republicans have,

95
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,440
the fringe guys are no longer fringe.

96
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,360
They pop up all the time,
and sometimes they win.

97
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,680
And Blankenship is not only surging
in the polls right now,

98
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,560
but he put out an ad doubling down
on everything you've seen so far.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,640
Swamp captain Mitch McConnell

100
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,240
has created millions of jobs
for China people.

101
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,600
While doing so,
Mitch has gotten rich.

102
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,120
His China family has given him
tens of millions of dollars.

103
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,960
Mitch's swamp people are now
running false negative ads against me,

104
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,400
they are childishly calling me
despicable and mentally ill.

105
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,000
The war to drain the swamp

106
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,960
and create jobs for West Virginia people
has begun.

107
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,000
I will beat Joe Manchin and ditch
Cocaine Mitch for the sake of the kids.

108
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,160
For the love of god: someone
please tell Don Blankenship

109
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,520
that he's allowed to make
facial expressions when he talks,

110
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,160
that there's no such thing
as a "China family,"

111
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,640
and that stealing two kids
from a waterpark

112
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,720
is not at all what people
mean by draining the swamp.

113
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,680
And now this !

114
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,760
Inevitable consequences of combining
local news and the fifth of May.

115
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,160
- Buenos dias.
- Ay dios mio.

116
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,600
Welcome to North Dakota Today,
I'm Kristi Larson.

117
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,960
Bienvenidos. Feliz Cinco de Mayo.

118
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,600
Star mixing the margaritas !

119
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,240
- Hello ! Or should we say, Hola !
- Hola !

120
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,400
- Happy Cinco de Mayo, everyone !
- Maracas.

121
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,200
Cinco de Mayo celebration !

122
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,520
Cinco de Mayo. That's simply Spanish
for the fifth of May.

123
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,160
I'm gonna put on my sombrero. Olé !

124
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,280
- Olé !
- Cinco de Mayo !

125
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,240
Looks great !
Are we gonna have some ?

126
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,480
- Olé for mole.
- All right.

127
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,040
It's commemorating Mexico's victory
over the French battle of the Puebla.

128
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,600
- Is it a big celebration in Mexico ?
- No.

129
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,480
No. No.

130
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,520
For our main story tonight,

131
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,520
we thought we'd check
in on the latest developments

132
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,520
in the ongoing Trump scandals
"Stupid Watergate."

133
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,040
A story
with all the gravity of Watergate,

134
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,280
if during it, there was a gas leak
in the White House,

135
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,760
and Nixon had been really
into huffing glue.

136
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,840
"Stupid Watergate" had another
plot twist thanks to Rudy Giuliani,

137
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,200
who only joined Trump's
legal team two weeks ago,

138
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,520
but on Wednesday made big news
during an appearance on Fox.

139
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,200
Trump is on record denying knowing
about a $130,000 payment

140
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,760
to Stormy Daniels to keep quiet
about their alleged affair.

141
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,840
But despite that, Giuliani,
Trump's lawyer now remember,

142
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,960
offered a whole new story
about where the money came from

143
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,040
that even startled Sean Hannity.

144
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,040
I'm giving you
a fact now that you don't know.

145
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,960
It's not campaign money.
No campaign finance violation. So...

146
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,600
- They funneled it through a law firm.
- Then the president repaid it.

147
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,840
- I didn't know he did ?
- Yeah.

148
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,560
- There's no campaign finance law ?
- Zero.

149
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,440
Ze-rooo.
He contradicted what his client said,

150
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,400
and he topped it off
with the drunk-sounding "zero"

151
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,600
of a man saying "my girlfriend left me,
but guess how many fucks he gives ?

152
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,640
Zeeeeerrrrrrrrrrroooooooooo !

153
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,800
In saying that,
Giuliani may have just exposed Trump

154
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,680
to multiple new legal
and political problems.

155
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,120
But he wasn't done.
During his media blitz,

156
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,200
he undercut the White House's official
line on why James Comey was fired,

157
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,120
prematurely announced the release of
American hostages from North Korea

158
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,440
something that, as of this taping,
has still not happened,

159
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,160
and made this creepy comment

160
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,680
about what would happen if
prosecutors targeted Trump's daughter.

161
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,360
I would get on, get on my charger
and go right their offices with a lance

162
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,000
if they go after Ivanka.

163
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,040
What about his son-in-law,
they talked about him.

164
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,360
I guess Jared is a fine man,
you know that.

165
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,880
Men are, you know, disposable. But
a fine woman like Ivanka ? Come on.

166
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,760
Setting aside the sleaziness
of calling Ivanka a "fine woman,"

167
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,200
let's not forget that he also called
a living human being "disposable."

168
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,640
Which is pretty harsh.
But also... it is Jared, ya know ?

169
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,520
It's Jared. He is basically a six-foot
three-inch stack of packing peanuts.

170
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,160
It's Jared, he's useless.

171
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,640
Giuliani's interview
was so ill-advised and chaotic,

172
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,560
it left many people on TV wondering
what exactly had become of him.

173
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,320
It's a long way from America's
mayor after nine-eleven.

174
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,240
This is not
the Rudy Giuliani we know.

175
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,160
This is shocking coming
from somebody

176
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,080
who was the post nine-eleven
mayor of New York City.

177
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,520
After nine-eleven Giuliani had a ton
of credibility with the American people

178
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,440
over this past week, it seems
like that's kind of all worn off.

179
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,560
People seem to be as shocked
at finding out who Giuliani really is

180
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,640
as a child at Disneyworld who saw
Mickey Mouse pull off his head

181
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,280
to reveal that he was actually
Tilda Swinton.

182
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,240
Not only are you not what I thought
you were a moment ago,

183
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,080
you are fucking terrifying.

184
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,680
If any part of you is also wondering
what happened to Rudy Giuliani,

185
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,600
tonight, we're gonna
try and answer that for you.

186
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,440
Because the short answer is: nothing.
He's always been this way.

187
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,520
That might be a little jarring.

188
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,560
The thing he's most famous for is being
mayor of New York City on 9/11,

189
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,680
after which he was rightly celebrated
for being a calm, steady presence.

190
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,600
He was Time's person of the year.

191
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,880
He received an honorary
knighthood from Great Britain,

192
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,160
and its closest
American equivalent:

193
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,160
being played in a made-for-TV movie
by Mr. James Woods.

194
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,880
Democrats always talked
about things getting better.

195
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,120
Republicans did whatever
they could to make them better.

196
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,560
That's what we're here for, right ?

197
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,560
Hot.

198
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,840
Right ?

199
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,800
Who wouldn't want to watch Woods
and the lady from "Kindergarten Cop"

200
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,480
trade Republican-themed pillow talk
on a green-screened beach

201
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,080
before exchanging the most sexless
kiss in the history of film ?

202
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,360
How did that not win
all of the awards ?

203
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,520
To understand Giuliani, you have
to go back before 9/11.

204
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,360
He made a name for himself
as a federal prosecutor,

205
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,560
where he acquired a deep
taste for the limelight,

206
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,680
going undercover to buy crack

207
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,960
dressed in a Hells Angels vest
and a white dress shirt.

208
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,640
Which made him look
less like a street junkie,

209
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,760
more like the third best member
of an all-dad blues band

210
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,280
called "Dad To The Bone".

211
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,400
He decided to run for mayor,
which was somewhat risky,

212
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,360
due to some substantial baggage.

213
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,720
A document
produced by his own campaign

214
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,360
flagged a "weirdness factor"
around him,

215
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,600
because his first marriage
was to his second cousin.

216
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,440
America's mayor was a cuz-nuzzler.

217
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,920
Don't worry,
because he has an excuse for that.

218
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,880
Giuliani says they discovered that
after many years of marriage.

219
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,040
Bull shit !

220
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,760
He didn't think it was weird
at the wedding ceremony

221
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,040
when one side of the church
was both families and the other

222
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,720
was one nervous photographer
who didn't take a single picture ?

223
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:44,480
Giuliani was elected and as mayor,
he continued his love of the camera,

224
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,440
showing up from
the Whoopi Goldberg movie "Eddie",

225
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,200
to "Law & Order",
to Bill Cosby's CBS sitcom,

226
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,160
which has not dated badly
in any shape or form !

227
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,080
But what many New Yorkers
remember about the Giuliani years

228
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,440
was his abrasive
personal style.

229
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,480
He had a local radio show, where
he would take calls from constituents.

230
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,600
You just listen to their concerns and
politely disagree whenever necessary.

231
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,560
Listen to this exchange
with a ferret owner annoyed

232
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,080
by the city's ban on
owning them as pets.

233
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,480
- Something's deranged about you.
- No, sir.

234
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,400
The excessive concern you have

235
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,880
is something you should
examine with a therapist.

236
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,720
This conversation is over, David.
Thank you.

237
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,360
This excessive concern
with little weasels is a sickness.

238
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,280
That's right,
that is the Mayor of New York,

239
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,840
actively choosing
to insult a New Yorker

240
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,400
whose only crime
was being a fan of ferrets.

241
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,760
When that ferret fan was given
the chance to present his side,

242
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,480
he was reasonable.

243
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,000
- David, thanks for coming on.
- Thank you for that, Tucker.

244
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,080
You have in your hands one ferret
is named Master Linus Van Pelt.

245
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,040
And the other,
Princess Katie Mini Mitts.

246
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,920
Fuck it, I hate to say it,
but I think I'm on Giuliani's side.

247
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,360
I'm on team Giuliani. Ferret
advocates are a lot like a ferrets.

248
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,800
I thought I'd like them, then I saw one
and now I'm not so sure.

249
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,640
It went well beyond picking
fights with ferret enthusiasts.

250
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,920
Giuliani adopted
a tough-on-crime stance

251
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,160
with an aggressive crackdown on
so-called "quality of life crimes,"

252
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,160
like panhandling
and jaywalking.

253
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,520
This approach antagonized a lot
of people, especially people of color.

254
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,640
Many remember it as a time
when the police were licensed

255
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,760
to do whatever they wanted:
a criticism shared by former cops.

256
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,920
We would get a lot of flack,

257
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,760
you're just doing this because
Giuliani is letting you do this,

258
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,040
and in my heart
I knew it was true.

259
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,080
If police officers
were just every single person:

260
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,160
"I want to stop you, to question you,
to frisk you",

261
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,080
then civil rights are gone.

262
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,840
Chilling. It's not like it's easy
to navigate New York streets anyway.

263
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,160
At worst, you're trying to get
around 14 Belgian tourists

264
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,720
who don't know
how to fucking walk in a city

265
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,160
and at best you might
be ambushed by Billy Eichner.

266
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,680
If you are not up
on your Meryl Streep trivia,

267
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,400
you deserve everything
he's about to give you.

268
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,240
By the end of Giuliani's second term,
many were sick of his bullshit.

269
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,600
He even had to move out
of the mayor's residence,

270
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,240
amid accusations
of an extramarital affair,

271
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,160
which he handled
in the worst possible way.

272
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,520
Giuliani told the media
in a news conference

273
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,360
that he intended to separate
from the first lady.

274
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,160
We've grown to live independent
and separate lives.

275
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,320
He'd given
no heads-up to his wife.

276
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,880
That is the most humiliating way
possible to end a marriage

277
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,440
other than announcing publicly:
"I boned my cousin !"

278
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,080
Then, of course, 9/11 happened
and all was forgotten,

279
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,360
because as "America's Mayor",
his reputation was solid gold.

280
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,520
Upon leaving office,
he cashed in. He wrote a book,

281
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,440
he gave speeches making as much
as $200 000 a pop

282
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,880
and he launched a consulting firm
called Giuliani Partners,

283
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,320
a name that sounds a lot like
a euphemism for cousins who fuck.

284
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,720
They're Giuliani partners.

285
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,000
It was love at first sight at their
greatgrandmother's funeral.

286
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,960
Nana always was a match-maker !

287
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,520
He became a partner in a law firm
and over the years,

288
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,880
his firm's represented clients
such as a tobacco company,

289
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,080
a private prison company,
Bank of America, Newscorp,

290
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,360
and Purdue Pharma,

291
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,200
the company that got in trouble
for supercharging the opioid crisis.

292
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,560
The companies whose logos
you'd expect to see on a NASCAR

293
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,680
driven by a homicidal grizzly bear.

294
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,240
In 2007, Giuliani launched what was
supposed to be his destiny:

295
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,840
a campaign for president,
which was catastrophically bad.

296
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,520
He talked nonstop about 9/11,

297
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,280
with some supporters even holding
a $9.11-per-person fundraiser.

298
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,960
All of which triggered this memorable
line from then-candidate Joe Biden.

299
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,240
Rudy Giuliani, there's only three
things he mentions in a sentence:

300
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,000
a noun and a verb and nine-eleven,
there's nothing else.

301
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,120
He's right. Giuliani could not stop
leveraging 9/11 for his own ends,

302
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,720
as evidenced by his children's book:
"One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, 9/11".

303
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,720
In the end, his campaign
flamed out spectacularly,

304
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,840
he did not win a single state

305
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,800
and he went from the frontrunner
for the presidency

306
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,680
to being out of the race by January,
having spent around $50 million,

307
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,360
all to end up with zero delegates,
or, as he would put it...

308
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,400
Zero.

309
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,000
Exactly, Rudy. Zero.

310
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,720
After that humiliating
presidential flop,

311
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:08,040
Giuliani ended up fading from view,
washing up in d-list places like this:

312
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,160
We love the mob movies you love.

313
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,560
Forget about it.

314
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,920
AMC Mob Week,
hosted by Rudy Giuliani.

315
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,560
Holy shit.
That is a steep fall.

316
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,720
Just ten years after being named
"Time" person of the year,

317
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,000
Giuliani was doing VJ work

318
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,960
for a cable network's edited for-TV
presentation of "Scarface".

319
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,680
Think about how crazy that is.
That would be like if, in ten years,

320
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:43,400
Bravo announced Fuck Boys Of '90s
marathon hosted by Malala Yousafzai.

321
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,800
How the fuck did that happen ?
What did I miss ?

322
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,200
A significant amount of goodwill
has somehow been squandered.

323
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,840
Giuliani frittered away years as
a rent-a-quote pundit on cable news,

324
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:08,400
and he didn't truly join Trump's
orbit until January 2017,

325
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,240
when he was named
Trump's cybersecurity advisor.

326
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,760
Why did Trump give him that job ?
Who knows ?

327
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,200
Maybe because Giuliani had
a security consulting business,

328
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,200
"Giuliani Security And Safety",

329
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,280
despite having
no real background in cybersecurity.

330
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,760
If you watch Giuliani
for even ten seconds,

331
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,400
you get the sense he tries to check
his e-mail by opening a Word doc

332
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,520
and typing: "Hi Google, check e-mail.
Thanks, Rudy."

333
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,560
Trump's real affection for Giuliani
probably came from his willingness

334
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:43,000
to lend his shreds of credibility to
various amounts of nonsense.

335
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,360
If I did one tenth of what
Hillary Clinton did, I'd be in jail.

336
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,120
She paid people
to create violence at his rallies.

337
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,320
She sold 20 percent
of our uranium to Russia.

338
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:04,360
I have 8 times online since January,
in which she's had coughing fits.

339
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,760
So go online and put down
"Hillary Clinton illness",

340
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,440
take a look at the videos.

341
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,200
Obviously, that is horseshit.
I do agree with him on one point:

342
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:19,720
visit "Hillary-Clinton-illness-dot-com"
and take a look at the videos,

343
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,160
they are eye opening.

344
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,920
We bought the URL for
"Hillary-Clinton-illness-dot-com"

345
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,640
and made it redirect to something
that Rudy Giuliani would hate:

346
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,000
this animation
of two ferrets fucking.

347
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,800
Also it is worth noting...
Stop it.

348
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:44,480
Giuliani Security, despite
Giuliani's cybersecurity expertise,

349
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,240
didn't seem to think to buy the URL
"Giuliani-dash-security-dot-com,"

350
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,400
so we now own that,
and it links to the only thing

351
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,160
that he would hate more
than two ferrets fucking:

352
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,600
two ferrets who are cousins,
not fucking.

353
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,960
The sexual tension is unbearable !
You know each other so well !

354
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,080
When you look at all of this,

355
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,240
Giuliani's role as Trump's lawyer
isn't an aberration.

356
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,000
Everything in his life has led
to this point.

357
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,240
While he may well be providing
terrible legal representation,

358
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,880
he's actually the most honest
representation of him in general.

359
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,400
They're basically two versions
of the same person.

360
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,680
They're both New Yorkers
coasting on their reputations,

361
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,080
had three marriages, neither
can shut up in front of a camera

362
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,480
and perhaps most importantly,
they both want to fuck Ivanka.

363
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,560
Weird for Trump because
Ivanka is in his family

364
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,200
and it's weird for Giuliani
because she isn't.

365
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,840
What happened to Giuliani is
really not the right question.

366
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,120
What's going to happen to him
is more to the point,

367
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,760
he is now the public
face of Trump's legal team

368
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,040
and who knows
what is gonna come of that ?

369
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,000
Maybe he brings Trump down
through incompetence.

370
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,320
Maybe he gets fired
in the next two weeks.

371
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,280
At the rate we're going, he is
so fatally flawed as a human being

372
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,000
that he's probably
going to end up president.

373
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,960
Although to do that,
he'll need a campaign website,

374
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,960
which he might find difficult.

375
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:21,680
"Giuliani2024-dot-com"
is no longer available,

376
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,600
because we bought it,

377
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,800
and it links to a dancing ferret
giving you the finger.

378
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,560
And now this.

379
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:36,200
Last Week Tonight salutes the horses
who didn't win the Kentucky Derby.

380
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,640
Shia Lehoof.
Dennis Miller's Wednesday.

381
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,240
Knock it off, Pamela.
FW: FW: FW: Cute Video You'll Like.

382
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,000
Are You There God ?
It's Me, A Horse.

383
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,720
Mark Cuban's Upcoming
"Me Too" Moment.

384
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,360
I Fuckin' Love Apples !
OT Level VIII.

385
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,720
Prince Harry's Unwatched
Queue Of "Suits" Episodes.

386
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,840
A Drawing Of The Prophet Muhamm...
Just Kidding It's A Horse.

387
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,720
Help I'm Trapped In This Horse Suit
And Someone Keeps Whipping Me.

388
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,560
And, Cocaine Mitch.
You may not have won,

389
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,000
but you're all still horses
and that's something !

390
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:20,520
And finally tonight. Just a quick
update concerning Alaska:

391
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,880
the state so far north it's almost
at the edge of our planet.

392
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Hashtag flat earth,
hashtag truth.

393
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,800
A few weeks ago, we talked about
a few remaining Blockbuster stores,

394
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,680
most of which are in Alaska
and they're in trouble.

395
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,600
We bought items from Russell Crowe's
recent divorce auction,

396
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,320
we issued the manager of Blockbuster
in Anchorage an ultimatum:

397
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,320
to call us within 48 hours so we
could send all of that stuff to him.

398
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,400
I have some good news
for you... He called.

399
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,600
HBO host John Oliver
has delivered on his promise,

400
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:00,400
as some prized movie memorabilia
is on display in last Blockbuster.

401
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,440
Just in time for tourist season.
Russell Crowe's jockstrap

402
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,960
has arrived
at the Blockbuster on Debarr.

403
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,960
A mini-shrine to Russell Crowe
has been erected in East Anchorage.

404
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,040
Everybody asks me, did they wash it ?
I don't know. I hope they did.

405
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,640
I've got some bad news for you,
we didn't wash it at all.

406
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,880
You probably should,
it's a documented fact

407
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,320
that Russell Crowe's 2005 scrotum
musk will attract bears.

408
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,800
That's a nature fact. If that had been
the end of this whole story,

409
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,360
I'd have been happy just knowing
we tried to help that store

410
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,920
by doing something
breathtakingly stupid.

411
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,680
This story gets better.

412
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,120
Because after our segment,
Russell Crowe himself tweeted:

413
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,400
"I am planning now on how
to best use the John Oliver money"

414
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,400
"given he's often shown genuine
love for Australians and Australia,"

415
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,960
"it's got to be special."

416
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,880
Incredible.
Mainly because, as far as I'm aware,

417
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,560
I've never shown genuine love
for Australians or Australia.

418
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,640
I've shown morbid curiosity for it,

419
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,000
the way a 9-year-old pokes
a dead frog with a stick.

420
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,560
I'm fascinated and grossed out
at the exact same time.

421
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:17,400
Russell Crowe revealed his plans
by tweeting out a well-produced video

422
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,800
and it is something special,
this is real.

423
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,400
We're the Irwins and we're here
at the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital

424
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,240
where we treat so many animals.

425
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,480
Koalas right now are suffering
a disease called chlamydia.

426
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,680
It can cause blindness, infertility
and even cost a koala its life.

427
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,400
We're trialing a new vaccine
and there is hope for the future.

428
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:50,200
Thank you to Russell Crowe for your
donation to help these koalas.

429
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,760
I have so many questions.
The first one really has to be:

430
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,600
how did all of those koalas
get chlamydia ?

431
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,120
I should ask what happened after this
photoshoot with Harry Styles

432
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,000
on One Direction's 2012 tour ?

433
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,480
You might be thinking:
"Well, hold on, John, hold on."

434
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,360
How do you know that the money
you spent went to those koalas ?

435
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,440
The video had
a little twist at the end.

436
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,520
A big thank you to John Oliver
for buying Russell's incredible things.

437
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,200
You are helping for the fight
for chlamydia

438
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,800
and a plaque has been organized
in your honor, check it out.

439
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,080
Are you not entertained ?

440
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,880
Well played, Russell Crowe.
Well played indeed.

441
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,480
That may honestly be
the greatest thing I've ever seen.

442
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:00,720
When this show started, I wrote
down my one and only goal for it,

443
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,880
and I put it in this envelope.

444
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,640
It was a simple goal,
it was just three words long.

445
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,400
That goal ?
A "koala chlamydia ward".

446
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,920
We have accomplished everything
we set out to do on this show,

447
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,280
thanks very much everyone,
but we are fucking done here.

448
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,000
That's right. Let's shut it down.
This show is over and please,

449
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,360
don't think of this
as a sad occasion,

450
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,120
because I leave you
in total triumph at this point.

451
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,640
I do hope that you enjoyed Last
Week Tonight over the years.

452
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,920
We made it
rather difficult to do that.

453
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,280
We did learn some things
along the way !

454
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,520
We had exactly 4 laughs
together so that's something.

455
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,040
The point is, pack it up, guys,
we're going home !

456
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,040
We did it, Jeff !
We got the koala ward !

457
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,680
I know you might be asking:
"wasn't making four and a half seasons"

458
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,600
"an inefficient way of getting a koala
chlamydia ward named after you ?"

459
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,360
And to that I answer: It worked.
So, I guess...fuck you ? I guess.

460
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,200
If you'll excuse me, I've got
a date with some contagious koalas.

461
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,360
That is our series !
Thanks so much for watching !

462
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,520
Goodbye forever, everyone !

463
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,680
I regret nothing !
My work here is done !

464
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,600
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

465
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,280
END OF EPISODE 10,
SEASON V
