00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,680
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,320
Season V
Episode 1

3
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,280
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,000
Thank you for joining us.
We are back, which is exciting,

5
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,720
although we must begin
by addressing Wednesday's events

6
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,280
in Parkland, Florida, where another
school shooting left 17 dead

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,520
and many injured.

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,760
These events are now so familiar
we know how each side will play out:

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,000
"thoughts, prayers,"
"fuck your thoughts and prayers,"

10
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,800
"a mental health problem,"
"also a gun problem."

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,920
Someone says: "not the time
to talk about gun control"

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,400
everyone moves on until
it happens again.

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,800
But this time felt different,

14
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,360
because when the "now's not
the time" argument came out,

15
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,560
the kids from that school said:
"you know what ? Yes it fucking is."

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,360
They have us thinking
this is inevitable

17
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,520
and we can't do anything
to stop it, it's too difficult.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,240
We're done with that.

19
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,040
Someone who isn't allowed
to buy alcohol legally

20
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,960
is allowed to buy a war weapon,
where does that make sense ?

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,240
They say no laws could have prevented
the hundreds of tragedies occurred.

22
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,720
We call B.S.

23
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:46,280
That we're too young to understand
how the government works.

24
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,840
We call B.S.

25
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,440
If you agree, register to vote.
Contact your local Congress people.

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,360
Give them a piece of your mind.

27
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,480
We call B.S.

28
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,280
It's ironic that the people acting with
the most maturity in this situation

29
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,360
aren't even old enough to say
"bullshit" in front of their parents.

30
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,840
Those kids announced
a march next month,

31
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,000
challenging adults to participate in
a real conversation about gun violence.

32
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,600
But they will be up against it.
When one adult was asked

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,640
about whether Republicans would
take notice of these kids' concerns,

34
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,080
this was his response.

35
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,320
We have a culture thing here
that we're not discussing.

36
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,200
When I grew up it was Andy Griffith
and you never had school shootings,

37
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,200
we still had prayer in school and we
drove to school with guns in the car.

38
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,040
I would see students that did that.
Today we are in a different time

39
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,120
when movie industry, rap industry,
radio in general,

40
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,560
talks about these things
that are common now.

41
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,120
Now we have to worry about kids
eating Tide Pods instead of discipline.

42
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,360
What ?
I call B.S. on that.

43
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,640
There are many things wrong there,
from the "rap industry"

44
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,000
to the Tide Pods to the fact that
that man was born in 1969,

45
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,600
a year after The Andy Griffith Show
went off the air.

46
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,480
Which means that he may
never have seen it,

47
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,240
not only did Sheriff Andy Taylor
not carry a gun,

48
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,960
he was happy to explain why.

49
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,040
When a man
carries a gun all the time,

50
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,360
the respect he thinks he's getting
might really be fear,

51
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,840
so I don't carry a gun, I don't want
the people of Mayberry to fear a gun,

52
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,400
I'd rather they would respect me.

53
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,680
The sheriff has got a point and
people of Mayberry "did" respect him,

54
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,280
despite the fact that
he ate Tide Pods all the time.

55
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,120
The Trump administration
had another chaotic week,

56
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,040
from Mueller's Russia indictments
to questions surrounding Porter

57
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,880
and who knew about
his alleged domestic violence,

58
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,400
to Trump's newly-reported affair
with a former Playboy model

59
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,160
a different sordid affair from that
other you might be thinking of.

60
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,400
The rest of the world also had
a politically chaotic week.

61
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,040
And so for a palate cleanser,
let me give you a quick tour of them.

62
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,200
Let's start in South Africa.
Paul Simon's black friend.

63
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,840
Their president the legendarily
corrupt Jacob Zuma, stepped down

64
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,680
following years of scandal.

65
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,320
So will they miss him there ?
Listen to what happened when his name

66
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,360
was mentioned by his successor
and watch the signlanguage interpreter

67
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,720
really read the room.

68
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,800
I wish to extend a word of gratitude
to former president Jacob Zuma.

69
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,040
I want that woman in the corner
of everything I watch.

70
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,640
State of the Union ?
I want her there.

71
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,640
A figure skater falling ?
I want her there.

72
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,760
Jack dies on "This Is Us" ?
I want her there.

73
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,800
You went back into the house
for the dog, Jack ?

74
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,200
Fuck the dog, you've got kids, Jack !
Boo Jack !

75
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,880
Wasn't just South Africa experiencing
turmoil. Look at Australia:

76
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,960
70% uninhabitable because of
deserts, 30% because of Australians.

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,880
We talked about their Deputy
Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, before,

78
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,280
he threatened to euthanize Depp's
imported dogs, Pistol and Boo.

79
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,480
Joyce is a social conservative who
opposed same-sex marriage

80
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,600
because he believes
in traditional family values,

81
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,280
and you can probably see
where this is going.

82
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,280
Barnaby Joyce, facing the public
over a private matter.

83
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,400
He's pleading for privacy after
News Corp published photographs

84
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,800
of his former media adviser now
heavily pregnant with his child.

85
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,800
You might think that that is
hypocritical, but in reality,

86
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,320
Joyce has such family values,
he can't restrict them to one family.

87
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,320
Media jumped on this story
like a Deputy Prime Minister

88
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,320
with a wife and four children jumping
on his 33 year-old media advisor,

89
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,200
and they even tracked down
the father of his girlfriend,

90
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,880
who is not thrilled
with Barnaby's behavior.

91
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,760
The man who could be
his future father in law

92
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,240
says he wants the Deputy Prime
Minister roasting on a spit.

93
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,560
Peter Campion
is bristling with anger.

94
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,120
I think the Deputy PM on a spit
would be quite a sight.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,920
That might be the most Australian man
who has ever lived.

96
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,960
In Australia,
they don't have Santa Claus,

97
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,720
they just have that guy
coming down your chimney,

98
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,440
and whether you've been bad or good,
he beats you with a newspaper.

99
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,880
The final stop on our tour
de scandal, Israel.

100
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,280
The thing you bring up when
your friends are the same party,

101
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,480
but you still want
to have an argument.

102
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,920
This week brought a new scandal
for Israel's leader.

103
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,240
Israeli police are recommending
that Benjamin Netanyahu

104
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,440
be indicted
on two corruption cases.

105
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,320
Claims that Netanyahu accepted
money from a Hollywood producer

106
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,880
and offered preferential treatment
to a publisher for positive coverage.

107
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,600
They also charged that he accepted
lavish gifts from wealthy friends,

108
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,000
including nearly $300 000 worth
of cigars and champagne.

109
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,440
Netanyahu and his wife
do have famously extravagant tastes.

110
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,280
She has been dubbed
"Israel's Marie Antoinette",

111
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,080
which is both a harsh criticism and
a chic bat mitzvah theme.

112
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,240
But the details
of their spending are striking.

113
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,520
They've been accused of spending
$1 700 of taxpayer money on candles,

114
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,160
$2 700 just
on high-end ice cream,

115
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,000
and in 2013, Netanyahu spent
$127 000 installing a double bed

116
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,920
on a plane he'd chartered to
attend Margaret Thatcher's funeral.

117
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,040
That's only a five-hour flight
from Israel ! I do kind of get it.

118
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,720
You go to Thatcher's funeral,
afterwards you'll be all worked up

119
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,120
and ready to fuck.

120
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,840
Netanyahus' efforts to spin
their use of public funds

121
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,520
have been ridiculous.

122
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,400
They tried to pre-empt criticism
by giving a reality host

123
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,080
a tour of the official residence,
to show the nation

124
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,280
what a pile of shit
it actually is.

125
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,000
The whole thing is in bad taste,
although there is one moment

126
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,800
that elevates it,
see if you can spot it.

127
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,800
This door has been
through thousands of paintings.

128
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,720
- What is this ?
- A lamp broke and it was glued.

129
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,440
What is this ? I'm in shock
that this is your kitchen.

130
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,680
It looks like the kitchen of a boarding
school in Romania in 1954.

131
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,360
What's in the back ?
This here is the closet ?

132
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,360
I think Anne Frank
is hiding here.

133
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,520
Apparently, at no point in the
editing process for that

134
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,040
did anyone say: "that all looks
great. Maybe lose the Anne Frank joke."

135
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,560
I half expected that South African
interpreter to appear saying:

136
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,840
"Anne Frank jokes, boo."

137
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,960
Says something about how destabilizing
the world's week has been

138
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,560
that watching someone tell
an Anne Frank joke

139
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,360
isn't even the dumbest thing
I've seen someone say on TV this week.

140
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,160
And now this.

141
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,200
And now for Valentine's Day,

142
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,640
local news presents
some heartshaped shit.

143
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,360
When we come back
in Vera's Corner today,

144
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,720
I'm gonna show you how to make
a heart-shaped hardboiled egg.

145
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,120
- Look at these heart-shaped bagels !
- Isn't this fantastic !

146
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,440
A heart-shaped boberry
biscuit for Valentine's Day.

147
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,360
Yes, it is heart-shaped.

148
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,200
A heart-shaped succulent
wreath, I guess.

149
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,360
- Heart-shaped strawberry.
- Heart-shaped pizzas !

150
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,800
This Valentine's sushi and
so we shaped it into a heart shape.

151
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,800
- Heart-shaped rib eye.
- Heart-shaped taco boxes.

152
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:09,360
A heart-shaped meatloaf frosted
with mashed potatoes. It's just fun.

153
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,280
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns Donald Trump.

154
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,480
The only president who combines
the extramarital affairs of a young JFK

155
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,200
with the dead-eyed puffiness
of a post-Watergate Richard Nixon.

156
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,800
We have talked about Trump a lot,

157
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,760
but tonight, we'd like
to do it from a different angle

158
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,360
focusing on his relationship
with the world.

159
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,000
You may remember one particular
remark he made.

160
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,560
According to the U.S. president,
Africa is a shithole.

161
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,840
That's right: he said that.
He absolutely said that.

162
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,520
Except, to be fair to him,
it's actually worse,

163
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,400
he reportedly called Africa, Haiti and
El Salvador shitholes.

164
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,600
I personally have called Belgium
a shithole multiple times,

165
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,000
but a, I'm not a president,
and b,

166
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,880
Belgium is a loathsome chocolate
gulag with no reason to exist.

167
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,680
So you can see
that it's very different.

168
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,560
You probably saw people on TV
being appalled by those remarks.

169
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,520
You may not have seen the response
from the countries he insulted.

170
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,880
I am honestly so shocked,
'shit countries' ?

171
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,760
Has he ever been to this country
to call it a 'shit country ?

172
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,640
We not shithole. We people.
We just like him.

173
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,480
He is a shit, yes, because
it doesn't matter what you have,

174
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,360
he's still going to the same hole
where the same worms will eat him too.

175
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,040
It says something about the Trump
era that the phrase

176
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,240
"the same worms will eat him too"
qualifies as a hopeful thought.

177
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,480
I'd like that crocheted on a pillow
so I can wake up to it every morning !

178
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,440
It is not like that's the only time
Trump's remarks caused an uproar.

179
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,440
He said Korea used to be part of China,
which outraged South Koreans.

180
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,000
He claimed that Germany owes NATO
vast sums, which it does not.

181
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,560
And in the UK, he retweeted
these anti-Muslim videos

182
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,680
from a far-right British group,
which triggered massive condemnation.

183
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,040
Instead of apologizing for it,
he said:

184
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,960
"it was a big story where you are,
but it was not a big story where I am."

185
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,040
And that is exactly his attitude:

186
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,480
"if it wasn't big where I could
see it, then it wasn't big."

187
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,880
Forget mastering foreign affairs,

188
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,600
Trump may not have
mastered object permanence.

189
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,640
Which you need to be a good
president or even a good baby.

190
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,560
Here is the crucial thing: the rest
of the world continues to exist

191
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,800
whether Trump acknowledges it
or not.

192
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,640
Let's try and answer
a few basic questions:

193
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,200
first, what is Donald Trump's
foreign policy ?

194
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,000
Seems to be more
than repeating a single phrase.

195
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,760
America first.

196
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,760
America first again.
America first !

197
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,440
America first.
It will be America first from now on.

198
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,320
America first.

199
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,520
If you are another country watching
that, you may be wondering:

200
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,200
"when has America's attitude
ever 'not' been 'America first ?'"

201
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,280
They've been putting America first

202
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,480
since the day they arrived in
America very much second.

203
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,120
To hear Donald Trump tell it, we've
been getting the short end of stick.

204
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,400
He often complained that America
had become a global punch line

205
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,720
and promised
he could reverse that.

206
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,360
The world is laughing at us, folks.

207
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,600
The whole world is laughing at us.

208
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,920
They're laughing
at what's going on in our country.

209
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,360
The world laughs at us, folks.
The world laughs at us.

210
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,480
We're not gonna be a laughingstock
like we have been, believe me.

211
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,880
We're not going to be
a laughing stock, anymore ?

212
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,560
It is insane that Trump,
this guy, this guy, this guy,

213
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,280
thought he would end the laughter.

214
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,280
It's like a flamingo in boxer shorts
named Finneas J. Rocketdump

215
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,840
ran for president under
the slogan: "time to get serious."

216
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,480
Since Trump became president, world
is laughing harder than ever before.

217
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,640
While all U.S. presidents
do get made fun of,

218
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,560
impersonating Trump has become
an international cottage industry.

219
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,520
Israel has Trump kicking a Muslim man
while dancing lewdly to Guns N' Roses.

220
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,840
Germany has him
dancing to "Uptown Funk".

221
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,280
Spain has him flipping off the world
and, again, dancing like an idiot.

222
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,720
Here he is in Pakistan,
here he is in Bulgaria,

223
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,520
here he is in Taiwan,
here he is in Ethiopia,

224
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,400
here's a pretty shitty one from Turkey
where they're not even trying,

225
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,040
here's a Korean Trump, and here's
one from an Italian comedy show

226
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,720
singing "Born In The USA" on
a fighter with a bucket on his head.

227
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,920
Are any of these funny ?
I don't know.

228
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,400
Is "any" thing about Trump
funny anymore ?

229
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,720
The world's most objectively
laughable human has become

230
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,400
a comedy graveyard
where laughter goes to die.

231
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,240
In case you think any of that may
have been good-natured ribbing,

232
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,360
a recent Gallup poll shows the world's
approval rating of U.S. leadership

233
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,440
has dropped to 30 percent after being
at 50 percent just two years ago.

234
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,160
That is a precipitous drop
in popularity.

235
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,960
Like replacing Gal Gadot in
the "Wonder Woman" franchise

236
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,240
with Matt Lauer.

237
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:34,200
I know that Donald Trump
and others

238
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,840
may not give a shit about
what the world thinks about us.

239
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,440
They really should,
for a number of reasons,

240
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,120
chief among them something
called soft power.

241
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Which sound like an erectile
dysfunction medication for chinchillas.

242
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,760
So soft, yet so hard.

243
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,160
Basically, it refers to the ability
to get others to do what you want

244
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,160
without using carrots or sticks.

245
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,200
It's kind of a country's brand.
And a nation's soft power can come

246
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,880
from your pop culture, to the ideals
you express, to your reputation.

247
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,280
And diplomacy
can play a major part in it.

248
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,200
Even hard power practitioners,

249
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,480
like Trump's Secretary of Defense,
Jim "Mad Dog" Mattis,

250
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,880
supports the soft power work
done by the State Department.

251
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,520
Years back, he gave a full-throated
defense of properly funding it.

252
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,160
They need to be as fully funded
as Congress believes appropriate,

253
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,760
if you don't fund the State Department
then I need to buy more ammunition.

254
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,120
That is scary, because "buy more
ammunition" is his way of saying

255
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,840
"without diplomacy,
there will be more wars."

256
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,160
He doesn't need ammunition so he can
make bullet earrings for his Etsy store

257
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,920
because he's not
just Secretary of Defense,

258
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,880
he also crafts accessories
for the elegant weirdo.

259
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,560
Trump has shown little interest
in soft power,

260
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,400
his administration proposed
a 29-percent cut

261
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,760
to the State Department
and foreign aid

262
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,840
and there are many vacancies
at the State Department,

263
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,240
to say nothing
of our lack of ambassadors.

264
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,280
From Belgium to Belize,
South Korea to South Africa,

265
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,280
President Trump has a problem.
His embassies have no ambassador.

266
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,440
Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, Qatar and
Saudi Arabia all without ambassadors.

267
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,640
Holy shit ! South Korea,
Turkey and Saudi Arabia.

268
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,960
Those are countries where
you really need an ambassador !

269
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,720
It's not Liechtenstein,
where you can scrape by

270
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,840
with a sign that says
"never stop Liechtenstein-ing !"

271
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,400
And as for the ambassadors Trump
has appointed, some are not great.

272
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,600
When Trump
appointed Pete Hoekstra,

273
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,520
ambassador to the Netherlands,
they were a little upset over there.

274
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,680
Speaking of threats, at one point
you mentioned in a debate

275
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,840
that there are "no go zones"
in the Netherlands.

276
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,320
And that cars and politicians are being
set on fire in the Netherlands.

277
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,880
I didn't say that. That is actually
an incorrect statement.

278
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,440
We would call it fake news.

279
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,440
Ok. "I didn't say that". He's given
himself some wiggle room there.

280
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,160
As long as he didn't say "exactly"
what the reporter just claimed,

281
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,960
about "no go zones" and politicians
being set on fire, he's correct.

282
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,680
The only thing in the whole world
that would make him "not" correct

283
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,000
is if say video of him saying that
cars and politicians are being burned

284
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,280
and that, yes, there are
no-go zones in the Netherlands.

285
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,960
There are cars being burned, there are
politicians that are being burned.

286
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,640
And yes, there are "no go zones"
in the Netherlands.

287
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,160
It's pretty weird not to recall
saying out loud:

288
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,880
"there are politicians that are being
burned" in the Netherlands.

289
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,680
It's not the thing you do
and immediately forget,

290
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,640
like driving to work or seeing
the movie 'The Post'.

291
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,800
I have a vague memory of walking
into a darkened room,

292
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,440
thinking "Meryl Streep is a treasure",
but the rest is a blank.

293
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,800
When Trump was asked about
his under-staffed State Department,

294
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,000
he claimed that it didn't matter,
for one key reason.

295
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,840
The one that matters is me.
I'm the only one that matters.

296
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,000
When it comes to it,
that's what the policy is going to be.

297
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,080
"I'm the only one that matters.
The only one that matters is me."

298
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,640
It's hard to tell if Trump
is laying out a diplomatic strategy

299
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,640
or demanding that daddy buy him
an Oompa Loompa "now".

300
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,400
If Trump matters,

301
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,040
his actions are
critical to our nation's foreign policy.

302
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,040
Our next question: how is
his approach to the world going ?

303
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,840
And the answer, surprisingly,
is great ! And now this !

304
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,240
Wait ! I'm kidding,
it's been a fucking disaster.

305
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:59,360
To give you a sense of how much
damage he can do in little time...

306
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,720
I can't believe
you nearly bought that.

307
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,640
Just look at last summer's
back to-back NATO and G7 summits.

308
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,400
It was just three days of meetings,
in which time,

309
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,840
he reportedly told European leaders
"the Germans are bad, very bad."

310
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,160
Then shook Emmanuel Macron's
hand so aggressively

311
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,200
it seems like he was trying
to masturbate an elephant.

312
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,240
At the G7 conference,
world leaders unsuccessfully tried

313
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,200
to convince him to stay
in the Paris Climate Accord.

314
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,200
He gave a speech where he failed
to explicitly reaffirm Article Five,

315
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:39,440
the basic principle that NATO members
should come to the aid of each other.

316
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,720
Affirming it is routine for presidents
and it was even in Trump's speech,

317
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,760
until being apparently deleted,

318
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,200
blindsiding top members
of his own national security team.

319
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,400
And after witnessing Trump's erratic
behavior for just three days,

320
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,000
Angela Merkel was so shell-shocked,
she made this statement.

321
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,280
The times when we could completely
rely on others are, to an extent, over.

322
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,000
I've experienced this
in the last few days.

323
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,080
We Europeans must really take
our fate into our own hands.

324
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,240
That was
the "day after" the summit !

325
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,480
Merkel wasn't even
supposed to give a major speech,

326
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,160
that was at a campaign event
held in a beer tent !

327
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,160
We're probably lucky there
was an event of any kind,

328
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,760
otherwise she would have just
yelled out "Europe is on its own !"

329
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,560
at her nephew's piano recital.

330
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:34,000
Our final question: what are
the consequences of this ?

331
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,280
One big one could be that there is
a leadership vacuum in the world

332
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,640
so who will fill that ?

333
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,320
In Europe, the obvious
candidate is Germany.

334
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,480
But even they know
that there may be an issue with that.

335
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,120
Whenever I talk to people
in our neighbor countries,

336
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,840
they mostly expected
sort of a leadership of Germany.

337
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,160
Whenever I talk to
the people in these countries

338
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,560
with a good memory what happened
in the first half of the 20th century,

339
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,040
they're very reluctant talking
about the German leadership.

340
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,280
You're right. I'm so glad
that you brought that up.

341
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,800
I didn't want to be the first one,
but you are absolutely right.

342
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,240
When people hear "Germany wants
to take a leading role in Europe",

343
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,560
most of us think, "no, they're still
in time-out, and they know why".

344
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,440
They know what they did.
Naughty Germany.

345
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,520
Globally, it seems that China is set
to be the biggest beneficiary.

346
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,920
They have been seeking
to increase influence and soft power,

347
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,240
something that
has not gone unnoticed.

348
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,360
An Asian head of government
recently explained to me

349
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,920
that at every regional conference,
Washington sends two diplomats,

350
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,120
whereas Beijing sends dozens.

351
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,360
The Chinese are at every committee
meeting, and you are not, he said.

352
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,520
The result is that Beijing is
increasingly setting the Asian agenda.

353
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,080
It's true. The U.S. is absent
at many important meetings.

354
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,000
That doesn't include meetings
Jared Kushner was supposed to attend,

355
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,000
but he couldn't find the room
and he was too shy to ask,

356
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,480
and then he realized
it was too late anyway,

357
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,160
so he just killed an hour in the lobby
pretending to be on the phone.

358
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,080
China's increased influence
should be alarming,

359
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,960
they're an autocratic country.

360
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,440
You don't necessarily want China
setting global priorities

361
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,960
on things like human
rights and democracy.

362
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,800
Trump's reckless behavior is opening
the door to that happening.

363
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,880
What he's doing is going to make it
harder to accomplish his own goals.

364
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,880
He wants to contain North Korea ?

365
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,560
You might want to appoint
an ambassador to South Korea.

366
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,400
He wants Germany to spend more
on its military ?

367
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,520
Maybe stop publicly shaming Merkel
if you want her to sell that idea home.

368
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,240
If he wants to contain security
threats like ISIS and Al Shabaab,

369
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,000
then maybe don't call African
countries fucking shitholes.

370
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,240
Trump can say that he doesn't care,

371
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,000
because
his approach is "America first".

372
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:11,280
But you need allies to get anything
done. Foreign affairs is like sex:

373
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,560
if you loudly announce
that you will always come first,

374
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,360
you're going to have
trouble finding partners.

375
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,560
And as for Trump's other promise,
that the world will stop laughing,

376
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,760
it is not just comedians doing that,
it's world leaders.

377
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,040
Australian Prime Minister
was at a press dinner last year

378
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,320
and he had himself a bit of fun.

379
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,200
The Donald and I, we are winning
and winning in the polls.

380
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,360
We are winning so much.

381
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,760
We are winning
like we have never won before.

382
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,760
Not the fake polls !

383
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,400
They're the ones we're not winning in.
We're winning in the real polls.

384
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,360
The online polls.
They are so easy to win.

385
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,520
I have this Russian guy.

386
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,040
Believe me, it's true.

387
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,800
That is a key ally,

388
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,840
using the fact that our president
is a pathological liar as a punch line

389
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:18,720
and crushing that room like a fourth
grader with a carrot up his nose.

390
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,160
If you think that was grim,
let me show you one more clip,

391
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,080
this one is from Russian TV,
with a comedian making fun

392
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,280
of Trump's suspiciously
close relationship to Putin,

393
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,200
and there is a fun little
surprise for you at the end.

394
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,440
The other day Hillary asked me:
Donald, do you love Russia ?

395
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,120
I answered: yes, I do.
I love Russia.

396
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,640
But you have
no evidence against me.

397
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,400
My best friend is President Putin !

398
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:07,920
My god. That is as happy
as I've ever seen Putin. Ever !

399
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,360
At least we now know what
type of humor that Putin likes:

400
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,720
the kind where he meddles
in another country's election,

401
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,760
has a joke about it in public

402
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,080
and then realizes it all worked out
and no one can touch him.

403
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,720
That's the kind of humor that Putin
likes. It just creases him up !

404
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,760
I know this is depressing.

405
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,400
It seems like America's reputation is
under attack from its own president.

406
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:37,200
Which is ridiculous,
soft power is an act of salesmanship.

407
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,080
It is the one thing that Trump
is supposed to be good at

408
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,840
and he's fucking blowing it.

409
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,400
As an immigrant who has
fallen in love with this country,

410
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,640
please allow me to speak to the rest
of the world in America's defense.

411
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:58,040
Donald Trump does not reflect America.
To be completely honest...

412
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,400
He does reflect it a bit.

413
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,560
But the point is,
America is not one thing.

414
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,720
It's a beautiful mess of contradictions
where good and bad are mixed.

415
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,760
On one hand,
it makes Mountain Dew,

416
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,720
which tastes like a honeydew melon
was fucked by a radioactive clown.

417
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,880
It also made this awesome bed
shaped like the Batmobile.

418
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,320
You can fall asleep in that
thing and "be" Batman !

419
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,400
If Batman somehow got locked out
of the Batcave.

420
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,840
But that's the American dream !

421
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,040
America's the country that came up
with YouTube, which, yes, I know,

422
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,800
gave you and the world
that shithead Logan Paul,

423
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,640
but it also gave you those videos
of adults in T-Rex suits on dirt bikes,

424
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,680
ballet-dancing, exercising
and doing basic car repairs.

425
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,240
That magnificent dinosaur costume ?
That's an American idea, too.

426
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,280
America is the country that gave you
Star Wars. You're welcome.

427
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,160
And Scientology,
we're sorry about that.

428
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,920
Sometimes, what's great
and terrible about us

429
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,120
is just impossible to separate.

430
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,200
Like Popeye's chicken,
it's objectively disgusting,

431
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,240
but I would run across traffic
to eat this shit.

432
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,920
Trump is the worst of us, yes,
but he's not all of us.

433
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,600
If I had to distill America
down to one sound,

434
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,960
it wouldn't be the voice of Trump
screaming "America first",

435
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,720
it would be the voices of
the New York City Gay Men's Chorus,

436
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,480
singing this song.

437
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,280
Somebody once told me
the world is gonna roll me...

438
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,600
That's right, that's
"All Star" by Smash Mouth,

439
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,480
a terrible, stupid song being sung
absolutely beautifully.

440
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,320
This should be
our new national anthem !

441
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:00,480
And so please world for the next three,
or seven, or, somehow, eleven years,

442
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,560
please remember
this is the country of Donald Trump,

443
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,360
but it's also the country of
people profoundly embarrassed by him

444
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,200
and the country that brought you
inflatable dinosaur costumes

445
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,240
and fucking Batman beds.

446
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,160
That's our show,
thank you for watching tonight.

447
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,640
We'll see you next week,
good night !

448
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,880
It's a great country.
Give me back my pillow.

449
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,680
END OF EPISODE 1,
SEASON V
