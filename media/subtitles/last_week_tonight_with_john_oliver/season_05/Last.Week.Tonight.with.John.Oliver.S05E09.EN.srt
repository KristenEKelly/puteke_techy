LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,110
SEASON V
EPISODE 9

3
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,050
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,210
I am John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:40,050
We begin with another busy week
for the Trump administration:

6
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,010
the "Sharknado"
of administrations,

7
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,140
spinning out of control,
destroying everything in their path

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,050
and will eventually
hire Tara Reid.

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,240
This week has been dominated
by the continuing fallout

10
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,150
of last week's FBI raid
on Michael Cohen.

11
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,140
While no charges have been
brought against him yet,

12
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,030
there is one question
on people's lips.

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,150
- Will Trump's personal lawyer flip ?
- Will he flip ?

14
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,330
- Is Cohen gonna flip ?
- Will Michael Cohen flip ?

15
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,170
Will the fixer flip ?

16
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,150
He is gonna flip
on Donald Trump.

17
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,180
Has he flipped already ?
What has he been up to ?

18
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,180
Everyone skips the question
"does Trump have something to hide ?"

19
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,320
and goes straight to
"will this guy hide it for him ?"

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,200
At this point, the only genuinely
surprising headline would be

21
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,200
"Bombshell: Trump Did Totally
Normal And Legal Stuff For 40 Years."

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,350
While the president insists
that Cohen won't flip,

23
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,290
some of those closest to Trump,
like Jay Goldberg, see it differently.

24
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:46,180
He articulated those concerns, on TV,
in the creepiest possible way.

25
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,280
He's of a type that I've recognized
in the past

26
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,280
as one not suited to stand up
to the rigors of jail life.

27
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:02,140
I think in many ways,
and it's difficult to say this,

28
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,440
prison has a racial overtone.

29
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,210
A person like Michael doesn't see
himself walking down Broadway

30
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,340
while people are clamoring
"you're gonna be my wife."

31
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,310
What ?

32
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,350
I'm not surprised that Trump
hired him as his lawyer,

33
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,240
it takes a questionable lawyer
to make a prison rape joke.

34
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,410
It takes a Trump lawyer to turn
that prison rape joke racist.

35
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,320
He's implying there that Cohen is
fine with being sexual assaulted,

36
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,380
were it not for the unfortunate
racial overtones.

37
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,340
Let's focus on a lesser-known
member of the Trump circus:

38
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,380
Ryan Zinke,
the Secretary of the Interior.

39
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,220
A man doing a job that Trump
fully understands.

40
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:59,350
I have to talk about a special guy
that I made Secretary of the Interior.

41
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:03,260
Does he know the interior ?
He knows it, he loves it,

42
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,620
he loves seeing it
and riding on it.

43
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,680
What the fuck
are you talking about ?

44
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,570
You sound less like a president
trying to introduce his cabinet,

45
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,660
more like guy at a yard sale trying
to sell a couch he fucked.

46
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,440
Do I know this couch ?
I love this couch.

47
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,470
I love seeing it and riding on it.
I just decided, she's not for sale.

48
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,520
Leave us alone. Get out of here.
Give us some privacy.

49
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,570
Zinke's job is to serve as a steward
of America's public lands,

50
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,460
he's overseen the largest reduction
of federal land protection in history,

51
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,620
including reducing the size
of the Bears Ears monument in Utah,

52
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,670
which included land sacred to
local Native American tribes.

53
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,540
While many said that that was
a favor to oil and gas industries,

54
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,600
Zinke pushed back hard.

55
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:56,510
I'm a geologist, I can assure you
that oil and gas in Bears Ears

56
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,510
was not part
of my decision matrix.

57
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,640
A geologist will tell you there
is little, if any, oil and gas.

58
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,270
Now, the geology is clear on that.

59
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,380
You might've caught Zinke mentioning
that he was a geologist,

60
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,250
at least forty times in public,
including under oath before Congress,

61
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,330
which makes it awkward that,
this week,

62
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,410
it emerged that Ryan Zinke
is not, in fact, a geologist.

63
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:27,300
He has never been a geologist.
He did major in geology in college.

64
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,380
Which does not make you
a geologist.

65
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,250
All it does is qualify you to watch
the movie "San Andreas"

66
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,420
and whisper:
"it wouldn't happen like that."

67
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:41,430
Zinke has a pattern of inflating
the importance of past glories.

68
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,380
When he ran for Congress,
he boasted about this.

69
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,480
I was a high school president
and we went undefeated

70
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,300
our senior year in football,
won the state championship.

71
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,360
America.

72
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,410
What was that ?

73
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,430
Would have made
as much sense if he'd said:

74
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,370
"I weighed 6-and-a-half
pounds when I was born."

75
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,440
"I once ate a quesadilla
burger at Applebee's. Bolivia."

76
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:11,400
All politicians self-mythologize.
Zinke has a flair for creative license.

77
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,470
He served as a Navy SEAL,
which is genuinely impressive.

78
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,270
Here is how his service was
described in an ad for his book...

79
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,260
Zinke rose through the ranks
to be a commander

80
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,370
at the same SEAL team that killed
bin Laden, saved Captain Phillips

81
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,420
and rescued the Lone Survivor.

82
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:35,320
Zinke retired that SEAL team ten
years before it saved Captain Phillips

83
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,470
and twelve years
before it killed bin Laden.

84
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,470
Zinke has blurred those lines.

85
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,310
He sent out this congressional
campaign fundraising email

86
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,250
citing his time as a SEAL,
with the subject line:

87
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,460
"Who killed Osama bin Laden ?"

88
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,460
Which is only a fair title
if the email goes on to say:

89
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,440
"Not me. You must be
thinking of someone else."

90
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,330
"He sounds great, you should
vote for that guy for Congress."

91
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,290
Zinke may well be
an extremely weird man.

92
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,470
Since becoming
Secretary of the Interior,

93
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,330
he's had his own special flag fly
outside the headquarters.

94
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,400
Which seems unnecessary because
that's something the Queen does.

95
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,300
He's also commissioned his
own commemorative coins,

96
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,250
to give to staff and visitors.

97
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,410
Why would they want one of those ?
Who wants a Zinke buck ?

98
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,410
The current exchange
rate for them is

99
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,310
"here, take it. I don't want it.
The guy's not even a geologist."

100
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,300
Watch what happened at a campaign
rally for a Montana candidate,

101
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,360
when Karen Pence had the unfortunate
luck to be standing next to Zinke.

102
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,260
My God.

103
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:03,280
The crazy part there isn't even
he lifted up the vice president's wife

104
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,300
and threw her around like
a sack of unbleached flour.

105
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,710
The truly crazy part
is no one else was dancing there.

106
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:16,570
That at its core is Ryan Zinke.
You may not have even heard of him,

107
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,530
but he is an important,
deeply strange man.

108
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,490
If I may sum him up the way he would
sum himself up in a campaign ad:

109
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,530
"Zinke is an oilfriendly,
coin-commissioning,"

110
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,510
"non-bin-Laden-killing weirdo
who throws second ladies around."

111
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,680
"And he is not
a fucking geologist. America."

112
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,700
And now this.

113
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,670
Somebody please tell Ryan Zinke
he is not a geologist.

114
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,490
Management decisions should be
based on objective science,

115
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,570
as a geologist
that's step one.

116
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,550
Ryan Zinke
is not a geologist

117
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,720
But from a point of view of a geologist.

118
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,610
Not a geologist

119
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,660
From a geologist
point of view.

120
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,500
As a geologist.

121
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,680
I'm a former geologist.

122
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,560
I'm a former geologist.

123
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,960
That's the question they ask.
I'm a geologist.

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,880
I'm a geologist. I'm a geologist.

125
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,890
Moving on. Our main story
tonight involves diplomacy.

126
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,950
The thing that keeps us from
going to war with our enemies

127
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,940
and from telling Liechtenstein
how we really feel.

128
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,950
You are a snobby polyp on Switzerland,
and they should have you removed.

129
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,980
It is a busy time for diplomacy
in the White House,

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,890
with the planning the North Korea
summit, weighing about Syria,

131
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,960
and a state visit with Macron
next week.

132
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,870
None of which is helped by the fact
no one has seen Jared in months.

133
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,940
Where is Jared ? How can we make
crucial foreign policy decisions

134
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,030
without the White House's
goodest boy ?

135
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,010
There's a massive decision Trump
has to make, just around the corner.

136
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,010
The Iran deal is coming up.

137
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,910
After months of "will he, won't he"
rhetoric,

138
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,940
the nuclear deal is on
the president's mind once again,

139
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,860
as he faces a May 12th deadline
to decide whether to recertify it.

140
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:15,040
There's a growing consensus that
this time it may finally be dead.

141
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,240
That is not a good sign
for the Iran deal.

142
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,200
Whenever it's a "will he, won't he"
question,

143
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,090
you can guarantee he will pick
the worst possible option.

144
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,230
Pull the U.S. out of
the Paris Accord ? He did.

145
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,180
Ban Muslims from
entering the country ? He did.

146
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,260
Will he look directly into the sun
during the solar eclipse

147
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,230
while pointing at it as if to say:
"Look ! The sun !" ? He did.

148
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,280
Of course he did that.

149
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,250
Trump has made it very clear
how he feels about the Iran deal.

150
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,040
He's called it terrible, a catastrophe,
stupid, insane, incompetent,

151
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,130
really sad, horrible, horrendous,
horrible, terrible, incompetent,

152
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:56,040
and "one of the dumbest and most
dangerous misjudgments ever."

153
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,210
Exactly what Trump writes in
Don Jr.'s birthday card every year.

154
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,130
As is appropriate. Those criticisms
are the tip of a very large iceberg.

155
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:09,270
I think it's the worst deal
I've ever seen negotiated.

156
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,110
My priority is to dismantle
the disastrous deal with Iran.

157
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,110
This is the worst deal.
We got nothing.

158
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:23,050
They out-negotiated our people.
'Cause our people are babies.

159
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,190
If I win, there's
no more being babies anymore.

160
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,210
That's right, Iran: there's
no more being babies anymore.

161
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,080
We're done wearing pull-ups
and going tinkle in our OshKosh.

162
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,160
We can put our own
straw in our juice box,

163
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,080
'cause we are big boys,
we have shoes with laces

164
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,110
and also a bike
that has Spider-Man on it,

165
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:46,240
'cause we are big boys, there's
no more being babies anymore.

166
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,040
No more.

167
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:54,170
This deal dying could have huge,
lasting consequences.

168
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,130
Which makes it odd that nobody
is paying attention to the fact that,

169
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:03,050
on May 12th, if Trump doesn't
feel like this deal has been "fixed",

170
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:07,080
he may refuse
to waive a key sanction.

171
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,130
Let's look at the Iran deal,
what it is, why Trump hates it

172
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,520
and what's likely to happen
if he kills it.

173
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,430
It would help to know the history
between the U.S. and Iran,

174
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,600
which has been fraught,
to put it mildly.

175
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,580
Here is a brief recap: in 1953
the CIA helped orchestrate a coup

176
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,530
to depose Iran's elected
prime minister,

177
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,510
replacing him with the Shah,
friendly to the U.S.,

178
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,560
and to whom we supplied weapons
and a nuclear reactor.

179
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,490
The Shah was overthrown
in 1979

180
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,490
and dozens of American diplomats
were held hostage.

181
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,620
The Ayatollah Khomeini
took power,

182
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,570
converting the country
to an Islamic theocracy.

183
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,480
That is an insultingly brief
history of the last 60 years alone,

184
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,410
but if you do want to learn more,
subscribe to my new podcast:

185
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,490
"Talkin' Tehran with John Oliver
and James Van Der Beek."

186
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,500
Here's just a small taste of it.

187
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,430
Let's talk about the privatization
of state-owned enterprises in Iran.

188
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,600
You're talking about
the work of Rafsanjani ?

189
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,480
No, John.
You do this every fucking time.

190
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,620
I'm talking about the underappreciated
role of moderates like Mehdi Bazargan.

191
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,440
Van Der Beek, you're thumping on
again about moderates.

192
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,330
- Shut up !
- You shut up !

193
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,460
Rafsanjani was a glory hunter !

194
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,320
Rafsanjani was the glue that kept
the whole thing together !

195
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,290
Without the backing of moderates,
he was nothing !

196
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,490
We need to do an ad
for MailChimp right now, okay ?

197
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,280
John, do you send
a lot of mass emails ?

198
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,480
It's a good podcast.

199
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,320
If you didn't know James Van Der Beek
was an expert in Iranian history,

200
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,390
expand your expectations
of what people are capable of.

201
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,380
In many Americans' minds,
Iran's image is reduced

202
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,480
to a place where U.S. flags
are set on fire

203
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,440
and where there are chants
of "death to America".

204
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:57,400
That is still part
of Iranian political culture.

205
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,420
Much of the power is
held by conservative clerics,

206
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,450
who force religious compliance and
pursue an aggressive foreign policy.

207
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,370
Believed to support
the Houthi rebels in Yemen

208
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:11,390
and Bashar al-Assad in Syria
and are a major funder of Hezbollah

209
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,460
and the current ayatollah
is still saying stuff like this:

210
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,100
By god's favor and grace,
nothing called the Zionist regime

211
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,020
will exist in the region
by 25 years from now.

212
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,080
It's not the most
important part there, but:

213
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,160
the country's name is "Israel"
not "The Zionist Regime".

214
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,230
If you're gonna make threats against
a nation, get their name right.

215
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,150
You would not like it if I called Iran

216
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:41,010
"Old Pappy Khamenei's
Palace o' Persians," would you ?

217
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,240
You wouldn't like it at all.

218
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,190
That is only part
of the picture of Iran.

219
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,160
There's also a large, educated,
relatively liberal middle class,

220
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,220
among whom opinions of America
tend to be more positive.

221
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,130
They have knock-offs of American
restaurants there called

222
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:01,110
"Mash Donald's", "ZFC"
and "Pizza Hat".

223
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:07,230
Which are direct rip-offs of
Marsh Donalds, ZFG and Pizza Hal.

224
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:14,060
Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani,
is moderate by Iranian standards,

225
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,190
even going so far
as to tweet a few years back:

226
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,810
"I wish all Jews, especially Iranian
Jews, a blessed Rosh Hashanah."

227
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,980
When an Iranian leader begins
a statement with

228
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,770
"I wish all Jews..."
and sticks the landing,

229
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,770
you have to hand it to him.

230
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:34,780
Pro-Western views are pronounced
among people born after the revolution.

231
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,930
Thrasher magazine,
my favorite skateboard magazine,

232
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,930
did a story on Iranian skateboarding
culture, which has thrived,

233
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,860
despite one obstacle.

234
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,880
Iran is under sanctions

235
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,910
and it's really hard for them
to import anything from the West.

236
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:55,810
This kind of put the skaters
in a position where they were forced

237
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,990
to make their own boards.

238
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,950
We saw one kid skating
a board made of solid steel.

239
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,890
It's an Iranian skateboard and
it's made of metal. Solid.

240
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,780
This is gonna last forever.

241
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,970
Sick deck, brah.

242
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,990
I'd double up on the grip tape
on my topsheet so I don't slam

243
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,920
when I go sketchy
on a nose grind.

244
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,920
I hope you enjoyed that joke,
it took one of my writers

245
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,910
50 minutes on the skateboarding
Wikipedia page to research it.

246
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,680
But that's true.

247
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:34,910
Those sanctions are one of the reasons
the Iran deal happened.

248
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,900
After the international community
discovered that Iran was secretly

249
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,850
building up a nuclear program,
it was concerned

250
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,840
and imposed crippling sanctions
affecting Iran's economy,

251
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,830
from oil to plane parts,
to banking and investment.

252
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:54,730
One key motivator in Iran coming to
negotiate was relaxing some sanctions.

253
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,780
All the partners in this deal,
the U.S., Britain, France, Germany,

254
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,810
the E.U., Russia and China agreed
to lift specific sanctions on Iran.

255
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,820
That's what Iran got out of this.
What did we get ?

256
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,680
And the answer is: quite a lot.

257
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,860
It requires Iran not to enrich uranium
to weapons-grade for 15 years.

258
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,900
To reduce its number of operating
nuclear centrifuges

259
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,680
from 19 000 to just over 5 000
and to increase the time

260
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,690
it would take to make a bomb
from a few months to a year.

261
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,620
It's true. Those
were big concessions from Iran.

262
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,660
The deal required them to reduce
the stockpile of uranium by 98 percent

263
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:38,630
and mandated they would not
enrich uranium above 3.67 percent,

264
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,770
which is lower than
the 90 percent needed for weapons.

265
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,660
To make a bomb
at under four percent enrichment

266
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,700
is like trying to get drunk
off of a single can of PBR.

267
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,760
You can't. It cannot be done.
There's no fucking way to do it.

268
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,650
Not unless you're a gerbil.
And even then,

269
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,790
only if you're drinking
on an empty stomach.

270
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,740
The deal also had strict conditions
for monitoring and verification,

271
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,790
to make sure
they were in compliance.

272
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,790
If they weren't, we could
snap those sanctions back.

273
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,780
Many felt it was too generous to Iran.
Benjamin Netanyahu called it

274
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,660
"a bad mistake
of historic proportions"

275
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,620
and here in the U.S., there was
hard opposition, with ads like this.

276
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,850
- Dad !
- Bud ! How was your day ?

277
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,930
- Sweetheart.
- I'm starving.

278
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,970
It smells delicious.
Thank you, this looks awesome.

279
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,930
How was your day ?

280
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,030
It only takes one.

281
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,030
A nuclear Iran is a threat
to our nation security.

282
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,890
That is a hostile way
to make your point.

283
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,990
There is only one ad
that you could justify

284
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,830
being interrupted by a nuclear
explosion and it is this one.

285
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,000
Enough !

286
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,010
Good. I'm glad
those children are dead.

287
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:13,910
But for all the talk over here about
Iran getting everything they wanted,

288
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:19,950
Iranian hard-liners were furious,
arguing they had given up too much.

289
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,990
Iran's lead negotiator
was this guy, Javad Zarif.

290
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,660
Chilling cellphone footage emerged
of him being confronted

291
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,720
by a member
of the Iranian parliament.

292
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,670
Listen to what was said to him.

293
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,710
It can go to hell !

294
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,630
If this country's unity
falls apart because of your actions,

295
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,710
you'll be the first victim of it.

296
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,700
If ISIS comes to our country,
you will be the first to take the blow.

297
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:49,560
If ISIS comes to our country,
you will take the blow.

298
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,780
That is both scary and honestly,
not consistent with how ISIS operates.

299
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,570
They don't come to a country
and say:

300
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,620
"okay, nobody dies until
we find that first guy."

301
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:03,640
"Nobody kills anyone until
that first guy takes the first blow."

302
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,780
"We do this in order,
or we don't do it at all."

303
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,570
"We're ISIS, let's not come off
like crazy people."

304
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,770
Despite all that opposition,
the deal was signed.

305
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,660
Which was a huge achievement,
or, as Donald Trump would put it,

306
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,750
a complete disaster.

307
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,670
I've studied
this issue in great detail.

308
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,790
I would say, actually,
greater by far than anybody else,

309
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,600
believe me.

310
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,560
And it's a bad deal.

311
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Let's be clear here: Trump has never
studied anything in great detail.

312
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,690
If you asked him what color
his wife's eyes are,

313
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,570
he would say "34D but firm".

314
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,610
What, specifically, does Trump
think is wrong with this deal ?

315
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,680
He has complaints. The first has to do
with monitoring nuclear facilities.

316
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:03,650
In terms of surveillance, they
have the right to self-inspect !

317
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,520
On their major, the most
dangerous, they can self-inspect.

318
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,670
That's not true.
They cannot self-inspect.

319
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,670
The deal allows for regular monitoring
of all declared nuclear sites,

320
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,640
one of which even has
24-hour video surveillance,

321
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,700
done by International Atomic Energy
Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog,

322
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,660
which has confirmed ten successive
times that Iran is complying.

323
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,650
If Iran complies just once more,
they win a free meal at Pizza Hat.

324
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,250
An extra little fun incentive
for them to stay in line.

325
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,300
That is not the only thing Trump gets
wrong about the inspection process.

326
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,180
We see something wrong or
we think there's something wrong,

327
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,270
so we have to wait
24 days before we go in.

328
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,200
But before the 24 days start,
there's a whole procedure,

329
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,170
so could be six months.

330
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:00,390
He's talking about the fact that while
inspectors have access to their sites,

331
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:05,170
they also get access to any
other site, military or civilian,

332
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:08,180
where they suspect
undeclared nuclear activity.

333
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,170
Iran can push back on those suspicions,
but once the IAEA demands access,

334
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,260
Iran has just 24 days max
to let them in.

335
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,310
It is a tall order to completely
clean up every trace of an isotope

336
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:27,200
with a half-life of 710 million years
in just 24 days.

337
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,250
That's not even long enough
to adequately clean your apartment

338
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,740
after you rent it out on Airbnb.

339
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:39,610
How is there jizz inside my piano ?
This isn't an accident.

340
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,700
It must be
why they wanted a piano.

341
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:47,650
One of Trump's other complaints
is that some parts of this deal

342
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,760
expire in ten or fifteen years.

343
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,690
As he sees it, that leads
to an obvious problem.

344
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:59,730
They can keep the terms and still get
the bomb by running out the clock.

345
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,760
That is simply not true. They can't
keep the terms and get the bomb.

346
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:09,730
The terms forbid them from doing that.
What Iran could do, in theory,

347
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,760
is wait for parts of the deal
to expire in ten years.

348
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,620
Then it could ramp up
its nuclear program,

349
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,530
getting it closer to a bomb.

350
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:22,600
If the deal blows up, Iran could start
doing that now, in zero years.

351
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:28,570
And zero is less than ten.
We ran the numbers on this ourselves.

352
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:32,730
I spent a week at Cambridge with
the chair of mathematics Michael Cates

353
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,590
and I feel virtually certain,
zero is less than ten.

354
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,520
Before the deal, Iran
had enough enriched uranium

355
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,600
to create eight to 10 bombs,
which they gave up,

356
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,580
meaning they currently have
enough for zero bombs.

357
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,360
Which, again, is less than ten.
I cannot stress enough

358
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,500
the extent to which
zero is less than ten.

359
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,370
We have to agree on that
or we're all fucked.

360
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,480
This deal isn't just between
the U.S. and Iran.

361
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,590
There are multiple countries involved,
none are anxious to change its terms.

362
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,410
Even Boris Johnson,
a man who looks like what would happen

363
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,520
if Draco Malfoy got an MBA
and developed a drinking problem,

364
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,390
even he thinks a renegotiation
is a non-starter.

365
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,500
I don't think anybody
has come up with a better idea.

366
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,560
It's incumbent on those
who oppose the JCPOA

367
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,450
really to come up
with that better solution.

368
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,570
You can't be against something without
having any plan for what comes next.

369
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:38,420
Trump is like a cat on an airplane
trying to escape from its carrier.

370
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:44,440
But if you get out, then what ?
Do you have a cat-sized parachute ?

371
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:49,430
What's your fucking plan ?
I'm not gonna say cat-sized parachute

372
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,290
without showing you
a cat in a parachute.

373
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,300
That is just a given.
I wouldn't do that to you.

374
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:02,290
Trump articulated what he wants,
some of his demands are non-starters.

375
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,430
He wants a ban
on ballistic missile testing,

376
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,320
unconstrained access
to any military site

377
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,360
and no expiration of any clause
in the agreement, ever.

378
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:14,240
And if those are dealbreakers
for him, this deal is broken.

379
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,400
You would hope
someone would talk him round,

380
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,310
Trump has surrounded himself
with Iran hawks.

381
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:22,280
His nominee for Secretary of State
is Mike Pompeo,

382
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:26,290
who has said of Iran, we know they're
cheating, we're just not seeing it.

383
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:30,280
Which is a hell of a statement from
a guy who gives rim jobs to gorillas.

384
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,360
No one has ever seen Mike Pompeo
giving a rim job to a gorilla,

385
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,960
but that's how
we know he does it.

386
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:44,050
Think about it. And even more
worrisome is John Bolton,

387
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:48,010
his new national security adviser,
a far-right conservative

388
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,030
who Trump had considered
for the job in 2016,

389
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:55,040
but hesitated because
of his walrus-style mustache.

390
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:01,840
I agree with Trump on that one.
That mustache is a huge problem.

391
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,970
He looks like he's possessed
by the ghost of Borat.

392
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,960
Bolton has long been
a critic of the Iran deal.

393
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:15,910
The deal is inherently flawed,
a strategic debacle for the US.

394
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,980
You can always tinker around
the edges and the question is

395
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,860
whether putting lipstick on a pig
is gonna make a difference.

396
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,010
This deal is preventing Iran
from getting nuclear weapons.

397
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:33,860
Pigs don't need lipstick to look
beautiful, you superficial asshole.

398
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,870
Pigs are beautiful the way they are
and they don't need to conform

399
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,990
to your unrealistic standards
of farm animal beauty.

400
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:44,070
Hashtag swine is sexy,
hashtag feminism.

401
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:51,170
Bolton has gone much further.
That ad with the exploding family ?

402
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,110
His group made that ad.
And if you're wondering:

403
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:58,140
what's his alternative to Iran deal ?
It can't be war with Iran, can it ?

404
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:03,090
Watch this speech that he gave to a
group of Iranian dissidents in Paris.

405
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,190
The declared policy of the USA

406
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:11,050
should be the overthrow
of the Mullah's regime in Tehran.

407
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:22,090
The behavior and the objectives of
the regime are not going to change

408
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:26,120
and therefore the only solution
is to change the regime.

409
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:34,980
That's why before 2019

410
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:39,070
we here
will celebrate in Tehran, thank you.

411
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:44,600
Holy shit. To my ears,
that is the national security adviser

412
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,430
calling for the invasion of Iran
before the end of the year.

413
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:51,620
So flagrantly horrific,
your brain can barely absorb it.

414
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,570
It's like the Barefoot Contessa
announcing she's going to murder

415
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,470
and cook her husband Jeffrey,
before 2019.

416
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,520
She's been so obvious if no one
stops her, it's partly on us.

417
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,620
Unless Congress or our European
allies figure out something

418
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,590
they can sell to Trump as a fix,

419
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:13,510
it seems that Trump is going
to re-impose sanctions on May 12th.

420
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,630
If he does that,
this deal could collapse.

421
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,550
The damage would be long-term
and potentially irreversible.

422
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:24,540
You would alienate a generation
of Iranians who support this deal.

423
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,600
Think about what this would do
to America's credibility.

424
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:31,450
Why would North Korea
consider signing a nuclear agreement

425
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:35,510
if we just broke the agreement we
signed three years ago with Iran ?

426
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,580
If Iran resumes its nuclear
weapons program,

427
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,600
it could start a nuclear
arms race in the Middle East.

428
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,370
I can't offer you much hope.

429
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:49,350
There is not a "write your
congressman" solution.

430
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:54,370
We could be in serious trouble,
two of Trump's top advisers are,

431
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:57,240
like him,
dead-set against this deal.

432
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,390
They're getting backup
from Sean Hannity,

433
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,250
whose show the president
watches so much,

434
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:05,250
advisers refer to him as
the "shadow" chief of staff.

435
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:09,250
Hannity hates this deal too.
There is not really a way for us

436
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,290
to get a moderating voice
into this conversation,

437
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:17,310
short of buying time on Hannity's show
and running an ad like this.

438
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:22,270
- Dad !
- Bud, how was your day ?

439
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:29,220
- Dinner is ready.
- Starving. It looks so good.

440
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,300
Hey there, Donald.
Sorry to interrupt your supper.

441
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:36,380
I'm a cowboy. Don't like pain
when I cath and I'm here to tell you,

442
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,370
the Iran deal may not be perfect,
but it helps restrict Iran's ability

443
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,370
to start making a bomb
for at least ten years.

444
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,960
You blow up the deal, and that
turns into zero years

445
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:51,880
and if I've learned one thing
from the years of cowboying

446
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:55,900
it's that zero is way less than ten.

447
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,110
That's correct.

448
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,090
You really wanna listen to a guy
with a mustache like this ?

449
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,960
Don't do it, Donald.
Don't do it.

450
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:10,900
- Does anyone smell gas ?
- My god, the stove !

451
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,970
Don't blow up the Iran Deal.

452
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:22,990
That ad is scheduled to run
during Hannity in the D.C. area,

453
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:25,120
where it will
confuse a lot of people.

454
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,910
I am not saying it's gonna change
anything, but at least we tried.

455
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,990
That is our show. Thank you
for watching. Good night !

456
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,920
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

457
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,930
END OF EPISODE 9,
SEASON V
