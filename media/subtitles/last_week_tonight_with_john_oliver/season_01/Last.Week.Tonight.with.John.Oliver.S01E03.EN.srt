00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,040
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,720
EPISODE 3

3
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,600
Welcome to the show !
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,680
Thank you so much for being with us,
I hope you're all well.

5
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,000
We begin tonight with big news.
History was made this week.

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,640
Technically,
history is made every week.

7
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,720
That's kinda how history works,
that's not the point.

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,200
Last night, a particular
kind of history was made.

9
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,800
The Saint Louis Rams
made history making Michael Sam

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,040
the first openly gay player
ever chosen in the NFL draft.

11
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,840
The first openly gay player
to be drafted in the NFL.

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,720
An NFL team drafting
an openly gay player.

13
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,200
He hasn't told his mom yet !
That is not cool !

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,600
This is fantastic news but perhaps
the true sign of how far we've come

15
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,960
isn't that the news have spent the week
focusing on the human interest angle.

16
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,360
It's that ESPN
has spent their whole week

17
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,520
showing no real interest
in him as a human at all.

18
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,280
He's much more of a designated rusher
than a 3-4 outside linebacker.

19
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,200
9 sacks came in 3 games each against
Arkansas State, Florida and Vandy,

20
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,640
only two and a half
in the seven other games.

21
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,720
To the combine where he struggled,
we're in a 4-9-1.

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,120
Sweet, sweet jargon !
The great mathematical equalizer.

23
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,720
At it's best the world of sports
is completely amoral.

24
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,680
If being gay helped Drew Brees
throw the ball even one yard farther,

25
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,200
even the most homophobic
Saints fans

26
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,760
would be imploring him
to question his straightness midgame.

27
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,120
Are you sure Drew ? Are you sure ?
Are you sure Drew ?

28
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,760
And I'm not saying
that there aren't idiots out there.

29
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,600
If you typed "Michael Sam"
into Twitter last night

30
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,840
you could find things
that made you despair for humanity

31
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,800
but this moment felt a lot bigger
than all of that noise.

32
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,640
For me,
the most heartwarming moment

33
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,400
was not when Michael Sam
sobbed in happiness

34
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,480
when told he'd been drafted
before lovingly kissing his boyfriend,

35
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,720
it was how the ESPN commentators
reacted immediately afterwards .

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,360
We've seen this over and over again,
we saw it with Taj Boyd,

37
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,560
the emotion of when you realize
all your dreams have been validated.

38
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,160
For the families and for the players,
there life long dream has come true.

39
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,880
They just uttered
the same bland platitudes

40
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,080
that they been uttering about
everyone else for three solid days.

41
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,440
Which genuinely
feels like a breakthrough.

42
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,000
So this is where we are now:
in a landmark move,

43
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,160
the St. Louis rams, the NFL, and ESPN
proved they are not concerned

44
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,640
about whether there are gay thoughts
in Michael Sam's head,

45
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,640
they are only concerned
about whether he's willing

46
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,560
to use that head
to smash into other people's heads.

47
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,720
We did it, everyone !
We have reached the mountaintop !

48
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:38,160
But from American sports
to something much less serious:

49
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,320
the potential war in Ukraine.

50
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,040
This morning, voters in eastern Ukraine
held a referendum

51
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,880
on whether or not to move
toward joining Russia.

52
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,160
But tensions had come to a head
in a very unusual way late last night.

53
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,680
Good evening Europe !

54
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,880
Let me explain.

55
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,200
There is a thing
called the Eurovision Song Contest.

56
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,520
It happens once every year, and it's
the craziest thing you'll ever see.

57
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,080
37 European countries

58
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,400
sublimate thousands of years
of ethnic and religious tensions

59
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,880
into a series of bizarre
3 minute song-tastrophes.

60
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,000
Laugh, but you'll be butter-churn
dancing in the clubs next weekend.

61
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,680
Churn it up, get a little bit wristy.
Turn it up....

62
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,680
Last night's final had Russia
facing off against Ukraine,

63
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,800
with their songs being voted
on by all the competing nations.

64
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,440
This contest had more oversight
than the vote for Crimean secession.

65
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,240
First up, it was Ukraine,
whose song featured

66
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,800
a guy in the background
running around in a hamster wheel.

67
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,320
In case that wasn't an apt summary
of their current political situation,

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,160
listen to this...

69
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,360
"Tick-tock,
can you hear me go tick tock."

70
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,800
Their song
was called "Tick-tock",

71
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,640
basically the countdown
to an explosion.

72
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,840
For their part, Russia responded
with a song performed

73
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,120
by 17-year-old
folically-conjoined twins

74
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,560
featuring the lyrics, and I swear
to you that this is true !

75
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,480
"Cross the line a step at a time,
maybe there's a place,

76
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,880
maybe there's a time,
maybe there's a day you will be mine."

77
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,400
That, that is essentially
an anthem to annexation.

78
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,520
Can't ask the people of eastern Ukraine
to choose between these two songs.

79
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,160
They're both too good !
Just go to war ! Go to war !

80
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,520
The continent should go to war again,
let Europe tear itself apart yet again !

81
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,120
The only way to stop this

82
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,440
would be if the Eurovision song contest
was somehow won by someone

83
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,600
so spectacularly wonderful that
it erased the tensions in a heartbeat.

84
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,320
Drag queen Conchita Wurst
took the trophy for Austria.

85
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,800
The diva won with the tune
"Rise Like the Phoenix".

86
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,960
This night is dedicated

87
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,480
to everyone who believes
in a future of peace and freedom,

88
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,440
you know who you are.

89
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,680
We are unity,
and we are unstoppable.

90
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,200
You know what ?
That's awesome, isn't it ?

91
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,680
Is it just me, or between Conchita
and Michael Sam,

92
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,160
did the world became a better place
to live in in the last 24 hours ?

93
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,400
Moving on !

94
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,720
Finally, this was also a big week
for Vladimir Putin, who visited Crimea

95
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,800
for a long-overdue victory lap
in Russia's newest territory.

96
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,040
Speaking before tens of thousands
in the port city of Sevastopol,

97
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,360
Putin hailed the incorporation of the
region as a return to the motherland.

98
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,040
It is Mother's Day today.

99
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,880
And there's nothing wrong
with moving back in with your mother.

100
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,240
It's "little" weird when your mother
sends an unmarked militia to force you.

101
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,080
And Putin's celebrations
didn't stop there.

102
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,200
Vladimir Putin will celebrate
Russia's annexation of Crimea

103
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,600
with a specially
minted silver coin.

104
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:48,400
That's his image on the front, a map of
the Crimean peninsula is on the back.

105
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,960
The coin weighs
more than two pounds.

106
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,000
Two pounds !

107
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,760
That's not a commemorative coin that
is a commemorative manhole cover.

108
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,400
Are you sure you want to be celebrating
quite this hard, Vladimir ?

109
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,760
Because I hate to remind you,
but the place you annexed was Crimea.

110
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,080
Crimea depends on Ukraine
right now for 25% of its gas,

111
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,320
for 90% of its electricity,
70% of water.

112
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,960
Crimea only produces about
a tenth of the energy it consumes.

113
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,960
Russia expects to spend between
five to six billion dollars in Crimea.

114
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,120
It's going to be a burden on Russia.

115
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,000
So Crimea is going to be a drain
on Russia's finances and attention.

116
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,480
So congratulations, Putin !
In order to stick it to the West,

117
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,440
you just adopted the sick cat
of autonomous zones.

118
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,640
Have you seen the Crimean people ?
It's basically this guy.

119
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,880
This is what you won, Russia.

120
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,440
This man and the entire history
that his face represents.

121
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,960
And I just want to be clear that
this guy's having a really good day.

122
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,960
That is what smiling
looks like in Crimea.

123
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,600
And why shouldn't he be smiling ?
After all, it's his 16th birthday.

124
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,560
Frankly...

125
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,640
If Russia is going to mint a coin
over their annexation of Crimea,

126
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,880
this coin might at least
be a little more accurate:

127
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,320
Crimea used to be
a piece of Ukraine.

128
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,720
After Russia's historic 2014 invasion,
it's now a piece of history.

129
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,840
And you have
a once-in-a-lifetime chance

130
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,280
to own a piece of history
about this piece of history,

131
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,600
with the "worthless desolate landmass"
commemorative coin.

132
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,800
Like the territory it commemorates,
the coin is symbolically impressive,

133
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,240
has absolutely no value whatsoever,

134
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,120
and will be a cumbersome burden
for generations to come.

135
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,880
On one side,
the silver-plated coin

136
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,280
features an exquisite portrait
of Vladimir Putin shirtless on a horse.

137
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,400
On the other side, it features Vladimir
Putin shirtless, carrying a horse.

138
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,800
If you're wondering
why there is no map of Crimea,

139
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,520
that is because Vladimir Putin
doesn't give a fuck about Crimea.

140
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,520
Which is what it says in Russian
around the edges of the coin.

141
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,680
Call now to order yours. Although,
on second thought, don't call now.

142
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,840
Why would anyone want this ?

143
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,840
Coin is not chocolate on the inside.

144
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,240
When Russia aid shipments during the
winter months, do not try to eat coin.

145
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,720
Let's move on !

146
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,520
Let's turn now to the US
and to campaign finance.

147
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,640
There was yet another development
on this week.

148
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,640
Federal election commission has voted
to allow a political action committee

149
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,920
to accept contributions
in the digital currency Bitcoin.

150
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
That's right: Bitcoin.

151
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,160
The currency of choice
for heroin dealers and assassins

152
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,560
is now perfectly fine
for political candidates to accept.

153
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,680
Are there any limits left
on campaign finance anymore ?

154
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,080
Corporations are people, people can
give pretty much whatever they like,

155
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,040
all of which has led us to the point
where 1 state in the midterm elections

156
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,960
is set to have the most expensive
senate race ever.

157
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,520
I'll give you a clue: it is the fiftieth
state that you are thinking of.

158
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,240
It could end up
being $100 million race.

159
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,000
The battle for the US
senate seat in Kentucky.

160
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,200
Kentucky ? $100 million ?
For Kentucky.

161
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,840
No offense Kentucky,
I'm a big fan of your fried chicken,

162
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,080
and, and I proudly
watch your derby each year.

163
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,080
Mostly to find names for my thrash
metal/SKA fusion band.

164
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,160
We are "Dance with Fate"
and we are extremely loud.

165
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,440
You might well ask:
why are Kentuckians

166
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,880
giving so much money
to their candidates.

167
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,720
Funny story: they're not.
The two likely candidates

168
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,360
are senate minority leader
Mitch McConnell

169
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,520
and his democratic opponent,
Alison Lundergan Grimes.

170
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,520
The vast majority of their big-donor
money comes from out of state.

171
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,480
Let's not pretend
that Kentucky's election

172
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,360
has anything to do
with Kentucky anymore.

173
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,080
Each candidate has been
using some of their money

174
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,320
to scorch the earth
with negative ads.

175
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,000
For Mitch McConnell, it's mainly
about how much he loves coal,

176
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,000
and how much
his opponent hates it.

177
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,760
To Barack Obama and his allies,

178
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,880
coal country represents a threat
to their idea of "green energy".

179
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,240
Whatever that means.

180
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,880
So when someone says a war on coal
is what the country needs,

181
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,960
they're declaring a war
on a heck of lot more than coal.

182
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,920
It's a war on Kentucky.

183
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,160
We didn't ask for this,

184
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,120
but if it's a war they want,
it's a war they'll get.

185
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,120
Holy shit,

186
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,720
I think Mitch McConnell declared
a war on the rest of the country.

187
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,000
"I love my coal. You come after
my coal, I hit you with a shovel.

188
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,400
Burning rocks is my favorite
thing to do. It's wartime."

189
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,800
That's a solid impression,
I don't want to argue with you.

190
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,280
We're not arguing,

191
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,240
McConnell's ads are a little
reductive and inflammatory.

192
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,400
I'm sure Alison Grimes will offer
a lot more in the way of substance.

193
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,720
He's blocked the senate
over 400 times

194
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,680
then voted to shut down the government
hurting Kentucky's economy.

195
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,560
Mitch McConnell
can't light the house on fire,

196
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,320
then claim credit for putting it out.

197
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,000
Two things there:
one that's not even special effects.

198
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,440
And two, that used to be
Kentucky's capital building.

199
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,920
But that ad speaks to Alison Grimes'
overall strategy:

200
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,760
to point out
that she is not Mitch McConnell

201
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,440
in any way, shape or form.

202
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,880
Alison Lundergan Grimes
is quick to remind you: she is female.

203
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,960
Women get it done, men...
Women can make it happen.

204
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,520
I'm proud, as the senator said,
to be a homegrown Kentucky girl,

205
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,280
unlike Mitch McConnell.

206
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,400
She's not wrong.

207
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,400
Mitch McConnell is not
a homegrown Kentucky girl.

208
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,560
Politfact rates that one as "true".

209
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:34,800
The main points are that she hates
coal, and he's an old man.

210
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,160
And the worst thing is,
things get less substantial

211
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,680
when you turn
to their online campaigns.

212
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,760
Back when Grimes
entered the race,

213
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,080
the McConnell campaign
welcomed her with a YouTube video.

214
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,840
That is a viral video in the sense
that herpes is a viral disease.

215
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,320
Once it's in you,
it is never going away.

216
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,400
And that was just the beginning
of the online trolling.

217
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,080
The Grimes campaign
later created an electronic valentine

218
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,560
so people could tell Mitch McConnell
"it's not me, it's you",

219
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,560
to which team McConnell responded
with a list titled "Valentine's Day:

220
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,800
a love story between
Alison Grimes and President Obama".

221
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,200
Accenting every meaningless point
with a tiny movie clip !

222
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,360
So who cares if the sentence
"they're so obsessed

223
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,320
with your 2nd amendment rights that
they want to control it all for you"

224
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,960
literally makes no sense ?

225
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,960
You get to look at the seagulls
from "Finding Nemo".

226
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,840
The people of Kentucky
deserve everyone's sympathy.

227
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,120
Or the ones with internet access
because here's an interesting fact:

228
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,440
28 percent of Kentuckians
don't have any online access,

229
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,520
a commodity that the UN
has deemed a "basic human right."

230
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,880
Even Alaska has that number
down to 18 percent,

231
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,880
and they had to lay fiber optic cable
through 1300 miles of narwhal.

232
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,560
Which brings us
to the larger point here.

233
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,040
This race is all but ignoring
Kentucky's many substantial problems.

234
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,120
And perhaps I should
explain this to candidates

235
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,640
in terms their campaigns
would approve of.

236
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,600
Here are five important facts
about Kentucky

237
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,400
that you might want to find
some solutions for.

238
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,520
Kentucky has the country's
fifth-highest percentage

239
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,000
of adults below the poverty line !

240
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,520
Kentucky is the ninth
most obese state in the country !

241
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,720
It is a lot !

242
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,080
Kentucky also has the country's
fifth-highest unemployment rate !

243
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,080
Yes ! Plus, more than
one in ten adults in Kentucky

244
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,000
lack basic literacy skills !

245
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,520
Yes, really !

246
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,280
And finally: Kentucky has the
nation's leading cancer death rate !

247
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,040
Yes, it is sad, something should
be done and that's the point.

248
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,360
What's happening in Kentucky

249
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,440
is just a microcosm
of what is happening everywhere.

250
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,560
As the amount
of money gets greater,

251
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,360
the ads nationwide are somehow
just keep getting worse and worse.

252
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,760
I grew up castrating hogs
on an Iowa farm

253
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,640
so when I get to Washington
I'll know how to cut pork.

254
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,440
And as for as long as I can remember,
my father had this rifle real handy.

255
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,640
Just to keep us safe.

256
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,720
My forefather used a canon

257
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,120
to fight the British in Savannah
and win us the Constitution.

258
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,320
If you're the sexual predator and
sociopath that murdered my sister

259
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,160
and you come to my front door
to do harm to my girls,

260
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,920
I'm going to use my glock;
to blow your balls off.

261
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,520
You heard it here first

262
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,600
the biggest trends
in political ad's this year: balls.

263
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,400
There is no way things
are going to get better

264
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,800
until we collectively
hit rock bottom.

265
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,040
And at this point, the only thing
keeping us from doing that

266
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,280
are the limits on what you can show
on network television,

267
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,800
which is where
we might be able come in

268
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,680
because this isn't
network television.

269
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,400
This is HBO.

270
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,840
This is the moral wild west
of sex and violence.

271
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,760
Have you ever seen the arterial
explosion that is True Blood.

272
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,160
Coming back in June,
by the way.

273
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,960
HBO, for years, brought you
middle-aged nudity on Real Sex.

274
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,560
Happy Mother's Day !
Take that down, take that down.

275
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,160
If things have to get worse
before they can get better,

276
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,040
then worse they shall get.

277
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,680
We have prepared attack ads
for both McConnell and Grimes

278
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,520
that are very much in the spirit
of the ads they're already running.

279
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,480
So Mitch McConnell ?
Here is your new attack ad.

280
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,160
Kentucky ! To us, it's home.

281
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,720
Kentuckians pride ourselves
on our industries:

282
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,280
we're proud of our bourbon,
we're proud of our music,

283
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,480
and most of all
we're proud of our coal.

284
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,760
But one politician hates coal.
And coal miners.

285
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,640
Alison Lundergan Grimes.

286
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,880
If she wins,
there'll be nowhere to run.

287
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,200
There'll be nowhere to hide.

288
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,720
She uses coal to kill
and not to power Kentucky's future !

289
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,040
Take a good look, Kentucky.

290
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,160
'Cause this is what a vote
for Alison Grimes will get you.

291
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,360
She'll kill everyone.
And everything.

292
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,000
Alison Grimes.

293
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,600
She will rip off Kentucky's head,
and shit down its neck.

294
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,040
I'm Mitch McConnell
and I approve this message.

295
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,280
That's yours !
Run it as much as you like,

296
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,920
run that as much
as you like Mitch McConnell !

297
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,080
But while you're doing it, Alison
Grimes will be free to run this on you.

298
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,440
For too long,
politics in Washington

299
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,680
have been dominated
by old, white, wrinkled dicks.

300
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,920
And no dick is older, whiter
or wrinklier than Mitch McConnell's.

301
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,400
Think about it, Kentucky.
Don't just think about it, look at it.

302
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,520
This dick's been telling you
what to do for thirty years.

303
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,520
It's time for something new.
It's time for Alison Grimes.

304
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,360
She's young, energetic,
she'll work tirelessly for Kentucky.

305
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,160
Unlike Mitch McConnell,

306
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,280
Alison Grimes believes in increased
funding for education,

307
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,640
cutting government waste,
and putting Kentuckians back to work.

308
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,760
Alison Grimes.
Mitch McConnell.

309
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,720
Alison Grimes.
Mitch McConnell.

310
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,600
I'm Alison Lundergan Grimes.
I'm honored to approve this message.

311
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,640
Do you feel that ?

312
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,000
We're at rock bottom people,
all of us together.

313
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,720
Now can everyone please try
a little harder in the future,

314
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,600
because there's nowhere
to go from here but up.

315
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,320
And now, this !

316
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,000
Last Week Tonight
asks "how is this still a thing ?"

317
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,320
Dressing up as other races.
How is this still a thing ?

318
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,240
On Monday,
MSNBC's "Way Too Early"

319
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,920
celebrated Cinco de Mayo
in a somewhat questionable manner.

320
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,840
It is Cinco de Mayo, celebrating
Mexican heritage and pride.

321
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,800
It's also an excuse to drink tequila
on a Monday morning at work.

322
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,600
Yes, that's professional reporter
and white guy, Louis Burgdorf,

323
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,200
in a sombrero
drinking from a tequila bottle.

324
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,920
Because, ya know...Mexico !

325
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,080
But, to be fair, that's just
one network with bad judgment.

326
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,960
This holiday is also known
as Cinco de Drinko.

327
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,200
Two networks
with bad judgment.

328
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,800
America has supposedly
evolved past its use

329
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,640
of racial caricatures
in movies, TV, etcetera.

330
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,120
What does 'etcetera, etcetera'
mean in Japanese ?

331
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,080
But even with racism
now officially over,

332
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,000
We don't have racism
in American anymore.

333
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
Some Americans
can't seem to let go

334
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,880
of their obsession with
dressing up in offensive outfits.

335
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,120
Serra High School football coaches

336
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,920
dressed as members of the Jamaican
bobsled team, black face and all.

337
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,480
Even when it's a shitty,
out of date reference

338
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,760
that no one had thought
about for years.

339
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,560
Yes, whether you're
an elected official,

340
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,160
Ashton Kutcher making a bold choice
in a pop chips commercial...

341
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,520
I'm Raj.
I am a Bollywood producer,

342
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,400
looking for the most
delicious thing on the planet.

343
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,160
Or a fraternity attempting to
celebrate Martin Luther King day

344
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,000
in the worst way possible...

345
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,480
The frat held an MLK party last
weekend where students dressed up

346
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,040
like gangsters then posed
for pictures holding watermelons.

347
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,240
The desire to play demographic dress
up runs surprisingly deep

348
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,240
even among
well-known actresses.

349
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,600
Julianne Hough dressed up in blackface
for a Beverley Hills Halloween bash.

350
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,880
Came as one of the characters
from Orange is the New Black.

351
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,320
Yes Julianne Hough
learned two lessons that night:

352
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,520
Wearing blackface to a Halloween party
is a terrible idea.

353
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,480
If she's about to leave the house
looking like an asshole,

354
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,600
not one of her friends will tell her.

355
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,680
And incredibly,
all this is happening at a time

356
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,800
when there are more costumes
available in this country

357
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,720
than in the history of costumes.

358
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,200
You can dress up as a fireman,
a nun,

359
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,200
a slightly out of shape
Captain America,

360
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,160
a sexy rocket scientist, a banana

361
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,960
or even a banana with a penis.

362
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,480
Along thousands more ridiculous
but non-racist costumes.

363
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,600
With all of these options,
it begs the question:

364
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,320
Dressing up as other races...
How is this still a thing ?

365
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,040
Finally tonight, The Earth.
You may know it as

366
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,320
"that blue thing Bruce Willis
is always trying to save".

367
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,840
Or from its famous collaboration
with "Wind" and "Fire".

368
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,520
Or just simply as "that place
where George Clooney lives".

369
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,960
The earth had some genuinely
bad news this week.

370
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,400
A White House Report
that says global warming

371
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,360
threatens every part of the U.S.

372
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,600
Climate change
is already affecting us now.

373
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,600
Now ! Smart move, Obama.

374
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,200
That is a key shift in how to talk
about climate change.

375
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,080
We've all proven that we cannot
be trusted with the future tense.

376
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,120
We've been repeatedly asked,

377
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,840
"don't you want to leave a better
earth for your grandchildren ?".

378
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,600
We've collectively responded:
"nah, fuck 'em."

379
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,520
But, incredibly this latest
damning scientific report

380
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,880
may still face an uphill climb
with some of us.

381
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,840
Here's that gallup poll
which found one in four Americans

382
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,880
is skeptical
of the effects of climate change.

383
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,400
That doesn't matter. You don't need
people's opinions on a fact.

384
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,480
You might as well have a poll asking
"which number is bigger, 15 or 5?"

385
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,400
Or "do owls exist ?"
Or "are there hats ?"

386
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,280
The debate on climate change
should not be whether or not it exists.

387
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,560
It's what we should do about it.
There is a mountain of research.

388
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,840
Global temperatures are rising. Heat
waves are becoming more common.

389
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,240
Sea surface temperatures are rising.
Glaciers are melting.

390
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,960
And no climate report is complete
without the obligatory photo

391
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,360
of polar bear
balancing on a piece of ice.

392
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,000
The only accurate way to report
that one out of four Americans

393
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,480
are skeptical
of global warming is to say,

394
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,240
"a poll finds 1 out of 4 Americans
are wrong about something."

395
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,160
Because a survey of thousands
of scientific papers

396
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,040
that took a position
on climate change found that

397
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:39,280
"97 percent endorsed the position that
humans are causing global warming."

398
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,040
I think I know why people
still think the issue's open to debate.

399
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,200
Because on TV, it is.

400
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,200
And it's always one person for,
one person against.

401
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,960
And it's usually
the same person for.

402
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,160
Bill Nye and Marsha Blackbird,
welcome both of you !

403
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,440
Bill Nye joins us now along with
climate change skeptic Mark Marana.

404
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,200
Joining me now to go
head-to-head Bill Nye,

405
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,160
CEO of The Planetary Society.

406
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,000
In the crossfire,
Bill Nye The Science Guy.

407
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,840
Bill Nye the Science Guy
believes in man-made global warming.

408
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,960
More often than not it's Bill Nye
the Science Guy versus some dude.

409
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,800
And when you look
as the screen its 50/50

410
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,080
which is inherently misleading.

411
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,200
If there has to be a debate
about the reality of climate change,

412
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,600
then there is the only mathematically
fair way to do it.

413
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,080
Last Week Tonight presents

414
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,080
a statistically representative
climate change debate.

415
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,200
Good evening, joining me tonight,
a climate change denier,

416
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,840
and naturally,
Bill Nye the Science Guy.

417
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,760
John, humans are causing climate,
no question.

418
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,320
Before we begin, in the interest
of mathematical balance,

419
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,240
I'm going to bring out two people
who agree with you, climate skeptic.

420
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,760
And Bill Nye, I'm also going
to bring out 96 other scientists.

421
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,720
It's a little unwieldy
but this is the only way

422
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,360
you can have
a representative discussion.

423
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,680
So, yeah. Please, file in !

424
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,920
Again, this is going
to make the debate difficult.

425
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,880
We shouldn't really
be having it in the first place

426
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,800
but representationally climate skeptic
please make a against climate change.

427
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,120
I don't think all the science
is in yet, it's settled.

428
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,560
And what is the overwhelming view
of the entire scientific community ?

429
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,840
Okay, any response to that ?
Any response ?

430
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,560
I can't hear you over
the wait of scientific evidence.

431
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,280
This whole debate
should not have happened.

432
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,560
I apologize to everyone at home.

433
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,880
My thanks to Bill Nye and the
overwhelming scientific consensus.

434
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Thank you at home for watching.
Have a great week ! Thank you !

435
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,240
I can't hear you,
the problem is....

436
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,400
You understand, there are way
too many of these people...

437
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,760
this debate...

438
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:20,120
I can't hear you...
it's an overwhelming consensus...

439
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,240
this consensus is overwhelming
so you understand,

440
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,480
I can't hear...

441
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,680
Make your point...

442
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,800
END OF EPISODE 3
