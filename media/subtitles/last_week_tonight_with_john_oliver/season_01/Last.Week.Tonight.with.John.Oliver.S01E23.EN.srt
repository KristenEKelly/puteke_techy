1
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,720
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

2
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,320
I'm John Oliver. Thanks so much for joining us.

3
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,840
Just time for a quick recap of the week.

4
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,960
And we begin--we begin--no! No! No!

5
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,080
That's literally too much. That's literally too much.

6
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,640
That's unearned.

7
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,960
We begin tonight in Hungary.

8
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,560
Yes, Hungary, the fantasy home

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,640
for every little girl who's young enough to love castles

10
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,120
but not quite old enough to be aware of

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,920
neo-fascist political parties.

12
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,360
Hungary has had quite a week.

13
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,000
WOMAN: Tens of thousands of
protesters marching in Hungary.

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,920
They're upset about
a plan by the government

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,480
to tax Internet use.

16
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,440
Tuesday's rally was
the second in 3 days.

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,160
TRANSLATOR: This tax is
the most stupid thing.

18
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,720
Other countries like Estonia,

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,840
they give Internet
for free to everyone.

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,880
It is hard to disagree
with the protesters

21
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,560
when their argument
is essentially,

22
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,840
let's catch up with Estonia.

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,840
Now, look, nowadays,

24
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,680
a tax on the Internet
is never going to be popular.

25
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,520
The Internet is supposed to be
free, like parking on a Sunday

26
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,880
or drinks at a wedding
thrown by non-assholes.

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,000
It doesn't help that
this tax is being proposed

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,720
by a Hungarian prime minister
who everyone hates.

29
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,400
MAN: Prime Minister Victor Oban
is accused of

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,240
becoming authoritarian.

31
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,760
He admits to moving Hungary

32
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,920
towards what he calls
an illiberal democracy.

33
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,080
He is close to President
Vladimir Putin,

34
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,240
and speaks warmly of how they
do things in Turkey and China.

35
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,960
Wow. That is 3 red flags
in a row.

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,040
Illiberal democracy,
close to Putin,

37
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,040
and likes how things are
done in Turkey and China.

38
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,840
If you just add "He likes
the way Hollister smells,"

39
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,160
we can officially declare
that man a war criminal.

40
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,840
Now, look, Hungarians marched
all this week, and the fact that

41
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,800
people are protesting the actions of an
authoritarian government

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,160
is not in itself a surprise.

43
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,960
The shocking thing here
was the result.

44
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,720
MAN: Hungary is nixing plans for that tax on the Internet,
at least for now.

45
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,000
The prime minister
says he is going to

46
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,400
revisit that tax,
though, next year.

47
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,680
Holy shit.
The protest worked.

48
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,880
And that is not a sentence
you get to say out loud often.

49
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,960
It's like, "Great one-man show"

50
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,640
or "Guy Fieri,
that was delicious"

51
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,760
or "I met my wife at
Dave and Buster's."

52
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,040
You don't often--the words
feel weird coming out.

53
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,360
But, look, there is no time
to celebrate, Hungarians.

54
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,440
You're on the clock.
If this tax

55
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,240
is being revisited next year,
you only have until 2015

56
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,440
to download as much pornography
as you can.

57
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,040
Do it now and get it all!

58
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,360
You don't know what
you're going to be into

59
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,280
this time next year!

60
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,560
The rest of us, let's move on
to the other side of the globe,

61
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,920
New Zealand, the country that,
like a bad Edible Arrangement,

62
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,200
is full of fucking kiwis.

63
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,440
Now, recently--recently,
John Key,

64
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,320
John Key, their prime minister,
was re-elected

65
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,240
despite--you may remember--
having a fight with Eminem,

66
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,360
or, as they call him
in New Zealand, Emmynem.

67
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,760
Now, Key is now back in office,

68
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,720
and he's ready
to tackle the most

69
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,360
pressing issues
facing the country.

70
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,920
MAN: You mentioned
changing the flag.

71
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,200
Is that something
you hope to achieve

72
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,440
in the next 3 years?

73
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,640
Definitely. You know, we
want to have the referendum,

74
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,960
and I want to embark on the referendum
relatively quickly.

75
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,160
I'd like that issue
dealt with in 2015.

76
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,680
Yeah, he wants to change
the New Zealand flag,

77
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,920
or as they call it there,
the flig.

78
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,600
And he's going to do that with
a flig referendum

79
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,200
in two thousand and fufteen.

80
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,880
Now, why is he gonna do this?
Well, one reason might be

81
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,800
it looks too much
like Australia's flag.

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,800
Because that is
Australia's flag

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,680
and this is new Zealand's flag.

84
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,640
Unsurprisingly, this has caused
some problems in the past.

85
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,440
There's just a huge
confusion factor.

86
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,800
So, I can tell you
as Prime Minister,

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,200
the number of times I
walk over to something

88
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,000
and I'm in an international
meeting and they sit me down

89
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,000
in front of the Australian flag
or the Australian area.

90
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,920
It's--you know, it's not funny.
It happens all the time.

91
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,320
Oh, it is funny, and that's
why it happens all the time.

92
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,240
Put him under
the Australian flag.

93
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
He gets so--

94
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,120
I want to hear him say "flig."
Make him say "flig."

95
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,800
Now, to be fair, John Key has
a replacement design in mind.

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,400
It's this one, which, granted,
looks like the flag

97
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,240
on a vegetarian pirate ship.

98
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,720
But it might actually
be inappropriate

99
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,200
for a different reason.

100
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,560
WOMAN: John Key originally
preferred the more traditional

101
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,960
black background
with a silver fern,

102
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,160
but now says his preference
is for a flag

103
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,240
that keeps more
traditional colors.

104
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,200
He denies that it has anything
to do with its similarity

105
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,800
to the flag flown by ISIS.

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,920
Oh, shit that is not good.

107
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,920
Because if you thought
being mistakenly seated under

108
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,960
Australia's flag was bad,
wait till they put you

109
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,720
under the one for ISIS.

110
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,400
This is not funny.
It happens all the time.

111
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,120
Why is it even here?

112
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,360
Look. Unfortunately, John Key's
even newer new design

113
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,240
has also met with some
resistance, as he discovered

114
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,920
when he went on TV
earlier this week.

115
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,040
MAN: OK. I'm going to
show you something now.

116
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,280
Have a look at this.
OK.

117
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,840
This is what you think is great...
I like it.

118
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,640
and I think it
is bloody horrible.

119
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,240
Bloody horrible.

120
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,720
How are you allowed to speak to
your prime minister like that?

121
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,880
It seems New Zealanders treat
their leaders like Americans

122
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,480
treat managers at Applebee's.

123
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,760
This shrimp is bloody horrible.
Take it back.

124
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,120
Still, I will say that is
a terrible idea for a flag,

125
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,160
which is why we have
a few suggestions.

126
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,600
First, how about a flag
that features two things

127
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,120
New Zealand is famous for,
such as a bungee-jumping sheep?

128
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,880
Or, if you don't like that one,

129
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,080
a kiwi bird having
sex with a hobbit?

130
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,800
Or you know what?
It honestly might be simpler

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,880
just to have a flag with the
words "We are not Australia"

132
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,840
written on a white background.

133
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,800
Although I can't guarantee
they won't seat you

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,880
underneath that just for fun.

135
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,160
Finally tonight, with
the biggest retail season

136
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,280
of the year nearly upon us,
one major retailer

137
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,880
unveiled a huge
innovation this week.

138
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,560
Lowe's is testing out
robotic shopping assistants

139
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,320
at one of its smaller
hardware stores.

140
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,920
Hello.
I am Oshbot,

141
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,920
the Orchard Store
robot helper.

142
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,560
What are you
looking for today?

143
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,960
Where can I find
more of these?

144
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,000
Is this the item
you are looking for?

145
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,400
Yes.
I'll take you.

146
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,440
Yes, Lowe's is introducing
robot sales assistants

147
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,680
to one of their stores, which
might seem like a good idea,

148
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,040
but brace yourself, Lowe's,
because you may be about to get

149
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,920
a lot of sexual
harassment lawsuits

150
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,280
from your refrigerators.

151
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,640
Although, going by their
promotional video,

152
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,160
at least someone
seems to be a fan.

153
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,800
I actually really liked it, and
we could be considered friends.

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,960
OK, stop.
Stop, stop, stop it.

155
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,480
Because the sentence
"The customer service robot

156
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,240
at Lowe's is my friend" may be
the single saddest sentiment

157
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,640
ever spoken out loud.

158
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,720
Robot assistants are a terrible
idea, and here's why.

159
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,400
Sales associates at
home improvement stores

160
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,640
are not there to help
people find things.

161
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,080
They're there to stop couples
from tearing each other apart.

162
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,960
If you really want
to test your marriage,

163
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,080
go buy home supplies together.

164
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,240
Because Lowe's is like
a swingers party

165
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,800
or a couples brunch.

166
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,800
No one is leaving
on speaking terms.

167
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,080
And the worst thing is,
Lowe's knows this.

168
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,960
Look at their own ads.

169
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,800
We went to Lowe's just
for some light bulbs.

170
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,040
And we got distracted.
I got distracted.

171
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,720
MAN: We got a little
bit distracted.

172
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,960
They were looking
at light bulbs,

173
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,240
but I had a feeling
they were interested in

174
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,400
some things
for the patio.

175
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,960
Can I help you with something for the patio?

176
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,800
No.
Yes.

177
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,120
Yes.
Yes.

178
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,240
I think that
means yes.

179
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,640
Nicely done, Lowe's employee.

180
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,360
You sensed an explosive
argument was coming

181
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,600
and you diffused it with
the emotional anesthetic

182
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,560
of patio furniture.

183
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,320
Robots can't do that.
They don't realize

184
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,040
that home improvement stores
are a lethal combination

185
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,560
of everything that can
ruin a relationship--

186
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,240
spending money,
reconciling tastes,

187
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,560
long-term planning,
and fluorescent lighting.

188
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,960
In fact, if I was Home Depot

189
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,960
and I heard that Lowe's were
replacing humans with robots,

190
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,880
this is the ad that
I would be running.

191
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,800
MAN: At Home Depot,
we value the personal touch.

192
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,840
Sure, Lowe's may have robots,

193
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,360
but we know there are some
things machines can't do.

194
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,560
MAN: We came to Home Depot to renovate
our kitchen

195
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,520
and things got
a little heated.

196
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,800
He had his heart set
on this copper sink.

197
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,880
Guilty.

198
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,440
They started bickering,
but I had a feeling

199
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,800
it wasn't about
the copper sink.

200
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,320
It never is about
the copper sink.

201
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,400
Why are you
fighting me on this?

202
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,800
It has a
10-year warranty.

203
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,160
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are we going to be

204
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,720
in this house
for 10 more years?

205
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,960
Well, where else
are we going to go?

206
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,840
In a house big enough
for the second child

207
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,960
you promised me
we were gonna have.

208
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,000
Hey, if I could
just butt in here,

209
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,360
there is a lot to be said

210
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,960
for a hammered-finish
copper sink.

211
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,880
It adds a lot of warmth
to any room

212
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,960
and copper is naturally
easy to maintain.

213
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,320
Plus, it is just a sink.

214
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,400
It is just a sink. Yeah.
It's just a sink.

215
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,520
You guys like Glade Plug-ins?
Check this out.

216
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,960
MAN: Doug was great.
He gave us advice

217
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,680
right when
we needed it.

218
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,200
Specifically right before
one of us said

219
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,120
something we could
never take back.

220
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,920
Hey, this
eucalyptus is nice.

221
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,200
Mama would love it.

222
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,720
Why does it matter what plants
your mother would like?

223
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,120
For when she
moves in with us.

224
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,640
No, I am not having
this discussion again.

225
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,480
Oh, boy. I told you again
and again.

226
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,120
I'm not putting her
in a home ever.

227
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,200
She raised me.

228
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,560
Yeah, you and your
deadbeat brother.

229
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,800
That's your
argument every time?

230
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,920
You bring up Devlin? He's trying.

231
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,280
It's hard to get
a job when they

232
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,560
have to do
background checks.

233
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,560
You should stick with the
Boston fern on this one.

234
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,960
The eucalyptus is for koalas
and pacifists.

235
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,280
Ha ha ha!
Now, if you want,

236
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,280
I can show you some of
our selection of floor plants.

237
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,440
Oh, my gosh, yes.
For sure.

238
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,880
He talked to us
about floor plants

239
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,360
for 5 solid
minutes until

240
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,480
both of us forgot what
we were fighting about.

241
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,320
That's what we do here.

242
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,960
Hey. I really like
this bamboo floor.

243
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,800
Of course you do.
He loves everything Asian.

244
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,320
Especially the girls
he looks at on his porn.

245
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,560
Excuse me?

246
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,680
Clear your history, Ben.
You're not the only one

247
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,200
who uses that iPad Mini.

248
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,880
That's
someone's daughter.

249
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,760
What if our daughter
were Asian?

250
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,840
How would our
daughter be Asian?

251
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,920
Well, we could adopt
if you weren't so selfish.

252
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,480
OK, so, if you're
asking me if I want to

253
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,360
fuck my hypothetical Asian daughter,
the answer is no.

254
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,800
Home Depot, I don't want a fuckin'
Asian daughter.

255
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,840
My hero.

256
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,200
Guys, guys, forget
about the bamboo.

257
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,360
Sure, it's good
with the humidity, but

258
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
wood flooring is barely better
than a carpet

259
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,000
when it comes to a bathroom.

260
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,960
Let me show you
some ceramic tiles

261
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,920
I think you'll
both agree on.

262
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,440
Great.
Yeah, let's do it.

263
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,320
BEN: Doug was great and the bathroom
is beautiful.

264
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,800
So you don't wish we'd
gotten that copper sink?

265
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,080
Not as much as I
wish you hadn't

266
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,840
given a hand job
to my best man

267
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,320
on our wedding day.

268
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,960
For the last time,
we were not married.

269
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,920
Is that
the only one?

270
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,160
How many hand jobs did you give out
that day?

271
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,960
I don't know.
Let's count them up.

272
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,640
Right? OK, great. Let's do it.
Fine.

273
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,520
2, 3? Who else?
Maybe.

274
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,040
Hey, let's take
a look at some

275
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,880
paint swatches
and think about

276
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,480
freshening up
that kitchen.

277
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,480
Oh, great.

278
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,720
What if you take
a Spring Grass

279
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,800
and lay it right in here
on Tournament Field.

280
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Oh, wow.
That looks great.

281
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,000
I'd go with that.

282
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,640
Let's talk
backsplash.

283
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,040
Moving on. Ahem.

284
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,800
Our main story tonight
concerns the fact

285
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,840
that if you've been near
a television recently,

286
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,960
you've learned
exactly one thing:

287
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,760
The midterm elections
are upon us.

288
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,320
Two days to go before
the midterm elections.

289
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,840
All eyes are on them.

290
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,960
The big question,
really, the only question,

291
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,240
do the Democrats hold on
to the majority?

292
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,000
Can Republicans take control
of the U.S. Senate?

293
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,560
Bottom line here is, this is,
as we say it every time,

294
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,560
one of the most important
elections in American history!

295
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,080
Oh, but I'm serious this time.

296
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,560
Take your American
history books.

297
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,680
Burn them in the streets.
They're worthless after Tuesday.

298
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,480
Why, the Senate is up for grabs.
I repeat,

299
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,840
the fucking Senate
is up for grabs!

300
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,800
All this crazy attention
on congressional races

301
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,320
is a little strange
for one important reason.

302
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,800
MAN: This Congress, with Republicans in
charge of the House

303
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,680
and Democrats in charge
of the Senate,

304
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,200
is on track to be the least
productive in history.

305
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,080
This Congress is
shaping up to be

306
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,880
the least productive in history.

307
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,520
Although, to be fair:
Congress is like jazz.

308
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,400
It's really about
the bills it's not passing.

309
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,320
It's also like jazz
in that most people hate it,

310
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,240
and anyone who says
they don't are lying.

311
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,920
And the Senate is likely
to remain inactive

312
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,120
no matter which party
controls it after Tuesday.

313
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,880
So, why all this attention
on the national level,

314
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,600
where almost nothing
is happening,

315
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,120
when down at the local level,
everything is happening?

316
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,520
That's right.
Tonight we're going to talk

317
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,840
about the elections that
actually matter on Tuesday,

318
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,880
the ones for state legislatures.

319
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,880
And look, I know it can be hard

320
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,800
to take candidates for
state houses seriously

321
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,800
partly because of their
ridiculous ads.

322
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,200
MAN: Senator Chuck Colgan is
fighting for you in Richmond.

323
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,680
I could stand here and tell you

324
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,520
how I was born
on a poultry farm.

325
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,760
Together, we can make West Virginia's
economy take off.

326
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,040
That's a great ad,
and I'll tell you why.

327
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,360
Because you just inherently
trust a guy who wanders around

328
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,960
in public with
a bird on his hand.

329
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,880
Drape a snake around
his shoulders,

330
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,360
you've got yourself
a president right there.

331
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,000
In Montana, one candidate
has an ad running

332
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,400
declaring his belief
in the Constitution

333
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,600
over a shot of the Declaration
of Independence

334
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,120
and what appears to be
a photo of an old man

335
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,400
stabbing a small child
to death with a flag.

336
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,680
That's a compelling image, yes,

337
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,960
but I don't know if you want to
use it for a political campaign.

338
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,360
The other problem is, whenever you do hear about
state legislatures,

339
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,720
it's usually because
something crazy has happened.

340
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,440
Like a fistfight between two
old men in the Alabama Senate

341
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,840
or a Florida state senator
looking at topless photos

342
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,840
during an abortion debate

343
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,520
or this California
assemblyman discussing

344
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,960
his sex life into
a live microphone.

345
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,320
-I've been getting into spanking her.
-You are?

346
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,960
-Yea, I like it.
-Does she?

347
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,520
Yea, when I spank her she goes, 'I know
you like spanking me. Don't ya?'

348
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,040
I go, 'That's because
you're such a bad girl.'

349
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,560
Ugh. Ohh.

350
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,480
It's not really a surprise
that you made

351
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,280
that mistake with a microphone.

352
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,440
You don't seem like someone who
can tell whether something's

353
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,360
turned on or not.

354
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:51,440
And even--even when lawmakers
are doing their jobs,

355
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,840
things can actually get worse.

356
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,400
A Florida lawmaker is
pushing forward tonight

357
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,120
with his plan to repeal a ban on dwarf-tossing.

358
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,600
I've spoken to
doctors and lawyers

359
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,320
and CFOs that are little people.

360
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,240
They can make their own
decision, and this state said,

361
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,880
"No, you can't,
we'll make it for you."

362
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,440
OK. Individual rights aside,
let's all just agree

363
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,840
that if it happened in
"The Wolf of Wall Street,"

364
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,880
it should not be legal.

365
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,440
And of course, sometimes, you'll
hear about state legislators

366
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,560
because of something
insane they've said.

367
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,840
Like Sally Kern from Oklahoma.

368
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,000
Is this just because they're
black that they're in prison

369
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,440
or could it be because

370
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,560
they didn't want to
work hard in school?

371
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,160
And white people oftentimes don't want to work
hard in school,

372
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,880
or Asians, oftentimes.

373
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,600
But a lot of times,
that's what happens.

374
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,920
I taught school for 20 years
and I saw a lot of--

375
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,920
a lot of people of color who
didn't want to work as hard.

376
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,480
They wanted it given to them.

377
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,600
Look, Sally, if you're going to
be that racist in public,

378
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,320
there's really no need
for you to use the term

379
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,160
"people of color."

380
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,840
African-Americans
are not listening

381
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,040
to everything you just said.

382
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,000
They're going, "Lazy? Hey! In prison? Hey!

383
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,920
"People of color?
Well, that is nice.

384
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,400
That balances it out.
That's basically clear now."

385
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,240
And she's not the only one
in the Oklahoma House

386
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,880
speaking her crazy mind.

387
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,920
I do not doubt that.

388
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,760
The phrase "Islam is a cancer"
is not usually associated with

389
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,000
people who are open to
new ideas or arguments.

390
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,360
The point is, is it any wonder

391
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,840
state legislatures are
perceived as circuses

392
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,320
when they give us
footage like this?

393
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,880
These damn bills that come out
here all the damn time,

394
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,840
come out here
at the last second,

395
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,840
and I got to try to figure out
how to vote for my people.

396
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,800
I'm sick of it!
Every year!

397
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,400
Enough!

398
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,840
I feel like somebody is trying
to be released from Egypt!

399
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,200
Let my people go!

400
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,040
Look. If...

401
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,680
If Moses had said,
"Let my people go" like that,

402
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,920
I'm pretty sure Pharaoh
would've said, "Fine, Moses.

403
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,040
I'll let them go.
Just calm the fuck down!"

404
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,640
Look, state legislatures
are hilarious.

405
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,000
There's only one problem.

406
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,920
Increasingly, they're the places

407
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,840
where most legislation is
actually taking place.

408
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,600
So far this session, Congress
has passed just 185 laws.

409
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,080
State legislatures have passed
more than 24,000.

410
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,560
I'm starting to realize why
that guy was getting so angry.

411
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,960
I'd hit a bill, too, if I knew
there were 24,000 of them.

412
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,840
It's too many!
It's too many!

413
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,720
It's too many bills!

414
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,040
And look, look, sure, some of
those bills were meaningless,

415
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,400
like Missouri
declaring jumping jacks

416
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,440
their official state exercise.

417
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,600
Incidentally, New York's
official state exercise?

418
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Kegels.

419
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,880
But look, not all
state laws are so silly.

420
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,240
Some have profound impact.

421
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,160
Legislatures are
sometimes called

422
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,120
the laboratories of democracy.

423
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,880
Sometimes their
experiments are great,

424
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,240
like raising the minimum wage,
like these states have done,

425
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,840
or overturning bans
on gay marriage, like these.

426
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,960
But other times, state laws
can go a different way.

427
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,040
Between 2011 and 2013,

428
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,080
individual states passed

429
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,080
more than 200

430
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,880
abortion restrictions,

431
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,800
more than the entire

432
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,040
previous decade.

433
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,440
That's right. In fact, a law which
passed in Mississippi

434
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,920
is so restrictive,
it could close

435
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,880
the one remaining
abortion clinic

436
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,840
they have in the entire state,

437
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,080
meaning a Mississippi woman
right now

438
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,720
could be saying to herself,
"I need to go someplace

439
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,080
more progressive, like Alabama."

440
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,320
State houses do a huge amount of
work while no one is watching,

441
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,560
from abortion to gun control
to environmental legislation.

442
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,120
And yet, admit it,
you probably don't know

443
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,120
who your state legislator is,

444
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,960
which means all those
conspiracy theories

445
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,160
about a shadow government
are actually true.

446
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,880
Only it's not a group
of billionaires

447
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,000
meeting in a mountain
lair in Zurich,

448
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,920
it's a bunch of pasty
bureaucrats meeting

449
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,320
in a windowless committee room
in Lansing, Michigan.

450
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,200
So, we took a look at
state legislatures this week,

451
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,800
and the first surprising thing
was that no two are alike,

452
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,160
because just as each state has
a treasured regional cuisine,

453
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,240
from Maryland's
Chesapeake blue crabs

454
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,360
to Florida's
half-a-cubano sandwich

455
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,800
wrestled away from
a dirty pelican,

456
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,640
each state, each state
has its own way of governing.

457
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,360
For a start, they
range wildly in size,

458
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:48,000
from 49 lawmakers in Nebraska
to 424 in New Hampshire.

459
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:54,160
424. Sparta fended off Persia
with only 300 people,

460
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,280
and for some reason,
New Hampshire needs 424

461
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,040
to issue a fucking leafy stamp.

462
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,960
And while some operate
year-round,

463
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,840
others are very much part-time.

464
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,320
Utah, for instance, has just
one 45-day session per year.

465
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,240
That's not a congress.
That's a summer camp.

466
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,640
Except instead of eating s'mores
and throwing sticks at possums,

467
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,120
they're passing laws restricting
a woman's right to choose

468
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,160
and throwing sticks at possums.

469
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,960
But whether they're full-time
or part-time, there is one thing

470
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,960
most state houses
have in common,

471
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,880
a shocking lack of oversight.

472
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,600
For instance, when it comes
to conflicts of interest,

473
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,560
"Generally, lawmakers
are supposed to

474
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,200
"recuse themselves from voting
on bills that would give them

475
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,920
a direct financial benefit."

476
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,640
You're essentially
asking state legislators

477
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,080
to practice self-control.

478
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,920
Remember, legislators
like this guy.

479
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,320
Let my people go!

480
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,880
OK!

481
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,640
So, let's look
at that in action.

482
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,560
Hawaii's state house
is part-time.

483
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,040
And one of its members,
Joe Souki, had a side job

484
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,640
collecting $24,000 a year
as a consultant

485
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,440
to a plastics
trade association.

486
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,840
So, when Hawaii was
considering imposing a fee

487
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,520
for plastic bags,
the onus was on him

488
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,400
to reveal his
conflict of interest.

489
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,040
Let's see how that played out.

490
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,720
I have a potential conflict of interest.

491
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,920
What is your conflict?

492
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,840
I'm a consultant with
the American Chemistry Council.

493
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,920
They produce plastics.

494
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,360
Right now I'm hired as a consultant
to work with Maury County

495
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,120
on this terraform problem.
Thank you.

496
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,600
Thank you very much.
There is no conflict.

497
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,960
What? What do you mean
there's no conflict?

498
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,360
He was being paid by
the plastics industry.

499
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,160
Unless in Hawaii
"conflict of interest" means both

500
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,960
"conflict of interest" and
"not a conflict of interest."

501
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,960
You know, like how "aloha"
means hello and good-bye.

502
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,280
That's the only fucking
acceptable explanation.

503
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,040
Now, to be fair, most states
have ethics commissions.

504
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,760
But an investigation into
how effective they are

505
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,880
gave grades of "D" or "F"
to 28 out of 41 of them.

506
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,680
And remember, if you
fail an ethics test,

507
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,560
that's doubly bad because
there's no fucking way

508
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,000
you didn't attempt
to cheat on it.

509
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,000
And yet, and yet somehow

510
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,600
with lax rules
and terrible oversight,

511
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,440
some state legislators still
manage to get in trouble.

512
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,240
MAN: In Massachusetts, 3
successive speakers of the house

513
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,360
have been indicted or convicted,

514
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,600
not to mention the lawmaker
who took a bribe

515
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,800
from an FBI undercover and
stuffed the cash in her bra.

516
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,840
Stuffing bribe money in a bra
is sad for two reasons.

517
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,760
One, you're corrupt.
But two, the amount of money

518
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,840
it took to corrupt you
fits inside your bra.

519
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,920
Meanwhile, meanwhile,
out in California,

520
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,800
State Senator Leland Yee
was arrested in March

521
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,840
on charges of arms trafficking
and wire fraud,

522
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,080
to which he's pled not guilty.

523
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,960
But that's not even
the most interesting part.

524
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,000
WOMAN: Yee was arrested
Wednesday along with suspected

525
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,960
Chinatown gang figure
Raymond "Shrimp Boy" Chow.

526
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:03,560
OK. OK.
So, first, that's amazing.

527
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,680
And secondly, how
is that the photo

528
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,920
they used of
Raymond "Shrimp Boy" Chow

529
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,840
when this one also exists where
he looks like an early nineties

530
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,440
Steven Seagal movie villain?

531
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,520
Come on, news!

532
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,280
Why would
Raymond "Shrimp Boy" Chow

533
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,000
have a photo like that
taken of him,

534
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,920
unless he wanted it used when
he was inevitably arrested

535
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,560
for arms trafficking one day?

536
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,240
Do the right thing.

537
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,680
And some state legislators
get in trouble

538
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,840
in the most pathetic
possible way.

539
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,040
Take Rhode Island's
Dominic Ruggerio,

540
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,920
whose political career managed
to weather him being arrested

541
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,920
for allegedly shoplifting
condoms from a CVS

542
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,920
at the age of 41,
while in office,

543
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,680
and who in 2012 was pulled over
on suspicion of drunk driving.

544
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,720
When police were questioning
State Senator Dominic Ruggerio,

545
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,960
his senate colleague Frank Ciccone pulled
up to the scene.

546
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,520
Ciccone allegedly told one
of the patrolmen, quote...

547
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,320
It happened, everyone.

548
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,560
I think we just hit
peak Rhode Island.

549
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,920
Think about it--a legislator
called Ruggerio

550
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,320
being pulled over by police,

551
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,280
while a fellow
lawmaker called Ciccone

552
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,320
swears at them about pensions.

553
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,760
The only way that could
be more Rhode Island

554
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,960
is if they were all
somehow clams.

555
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,360
And yet, you have to remember
all the people you've seen

556
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,600
were elected to bodies
where legislation

557
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,080
actually gets passed.

558
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,360
A lot.

559
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,920
And whilst most people
may ignore these bodies,

560
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,840
corporations certainly don't.

561
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,200
In fact, they've taken advantage
through a group called ALEC.

562
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,320
And yes, "ALEC" sounds like

563
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,000
the name of a high school
lacrosse player

564
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,640
who just got baked and wrecked
his dad's Saab.

565
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,600
But incredibly, it's
actually even worse.

566
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,120
MAN: For more than 30 years,

567
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,640
a private tax-exempt
organization

568
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,680
called the American Legislative
Exchange Council, ALEC,

569
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,240
has brought state lawmakers,
conservative think tanks,

570
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,000
and corporate interests together

571
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,920
to write model legislation
to be introduced and passed

572
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,840
in state houses
across the country.

573
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,800
It's basically
a conservative bill mill,

574
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,880
which has helped develop
model legislation from

575
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,240
Arizona's notorious
SB1070 immigration bill,

576
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,600
to bills expanding
private prisons,

577
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,720
payday loan companies,
and for-profit colleges,

578
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,320
all of which we've talked about
on this very show.

579
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,120
In fact, I'm going to list ALEC
in the credits for our show

580
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,440
as associate producer
of creating horrifying things

581
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,800
for us to talk about.

582
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,200
Great work, ALEC.

583
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,640
See you at the end of season
wrap party, you pieces of shit.

584
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,720
The thing is,
ALEC is everywhere.

585
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,760
Roughly one in 4 state
legislators are members.

586
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,080
And it's not hard to see why.
ALEC makes their jobs

587
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,640
troublingly easy.

588
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,000
Here's their model
electricity freedom bill,

589
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,880
which at one point says,
"Be it therefore enacted

590
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,720
"that the state of--
insert state--

591
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,920
repeals the renewable
energy mandate."

592
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,840
So, as long as you can remember

593
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,440
and spell the name
of your state,

594
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,800
you can introduce legislation.

595
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,800
And I think it's
fair to say that

596
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,040
most of the people we've
seen so far tonight

597
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,560
could probably do that.

598
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,360
And some legislators
don't even bother

599
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,040
hiding ALEC's fingerprints.

600
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,840
Just watch a Minnesota lawmaker

601
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,360
get confronted by
one of his colleagues.

602
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,000
I'm just curious,
does it have--

603
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,360
does the legislation have
some connection to ALEC?

604
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,000
Representative Atkins, I'm
not sure why we're pursuing

605
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,280
this course of questioning.

606
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,800
This bill is my bill,
it's not ALEC's bill.

607
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,240
Well, the reason I ask is
because earlier you passed out

608
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,280
a handout that says,
"Gottwalt," at the top,

609
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,880
and it says, "Health care
compact," and there's a logo

610
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,840
right in the middle
of that page,

611
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,440
and I went to the ALEC web site

612
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,640
and there's exactly
the same font,

613
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,960
the same size,
and the same logo.

614
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,880
I mean, literally,
it's verbatim.

615
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,400
Look, I hate to sound like
Billy Baldwin's agent,

616
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,120
but you can't just copy
everything that ALEC does.

617
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,440
It's pathetic.

618
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,440
At this point,
at this point, it's clear.

619
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,960
Between the bad behavior
and the lack of accountability,

620
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,960
states are not so much
the laboratories of democracy

621
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,280
as the frat houses of democracy.

622
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,240
And yet, they get no attention.

623
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,880
Perhaps that's because it's
very hard for us to be angry

624
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,280
with people whose names
we don't know.

625
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,360
And if you're thinking, "Well,
OK, now I'll pay more attention

626
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,480
before going to vote
on Tuesday," that's great.

627
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,560
Unfortunately, for many
of you, it's too late.

628
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,840
Because an estimated 25% of
the candidates on Tuesday

629
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,800
are running unopposed.

630
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,040
Their sole political asset
is that they exist

631
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,880
and they're going to win.

632
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,520
So, with that in mind,

633
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,000
with that in mind,
let's call some races.

634
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,800
Because you know what?
Even though

635
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,200
polls don't close
for another two days

636
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,600
and most people haven't
even started voting yet,

637
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,920
with 0% of precincts reporting,
we can call some winners.

638
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,760
So, let's do it.
Let's do it.

639
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,800
Remember the Florida
dwarf-tossing guy?

640
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,120
His name is Ritch Workman.

641
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,240
He's running unopposed,
so he wins!

642
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,720
Remember the lady in Oklahoma
with the interesting theories

643
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,600
on black prison population?
Winner.

644
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,320
The "Islam is a cancer" guy?
Winner.

645
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,480
The alleged drunk-driving
Rhode Island condom thief

646
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,640
and his angry friend?

647
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,240
Winner winner, chicken dinner.

648
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,920
And this is just the beginning.

649
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,640
Because we can call over
1,000 races across America.

650
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,520
He's a winner.
She's a winner.

651
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,560
All these people are winners,

652
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,920
so, congratulations
to all of you

653
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,560
for defeating the very
concept of nothing!

654
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,040
Congratulations, one and all.

655
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,800
We look forward to you wielding

656
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,960
a terrifying amount of influence

657
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,920
for the next several years,

658
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,960
safe in the knowledge
that no one will be

659
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,840
paying any attention.

660
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,480
That's our show.
Thank you so much for watching.

661
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:59,480
Good night!

662
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,240
This nice
laser green.

663
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,440
Lay it right in here
on Antigua Sunrise.

664
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,600
Oh, my.
That's beautiful.

665
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,280
That's a good combo.

666
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,040
I'm thinking maybe
a Spring Grass

667
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,200
or Go-Go Lime with
a Jade Mountain.

668
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,440
We drop it in on
an Aqua Fresco.

669
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,480
Oh, wow. Two.

670
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,960
What about
a Go-Go Lime,

671
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,920
lay it right in here
on Jet Ski?

672
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,560
Oh, my God.
That's beautiful.

673
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,360
That's your accent.
That's your back splash.

674
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,720
I like that combination
a lot.

675
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,960
You've got
an eye for color.

676
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,760
Yeah.
