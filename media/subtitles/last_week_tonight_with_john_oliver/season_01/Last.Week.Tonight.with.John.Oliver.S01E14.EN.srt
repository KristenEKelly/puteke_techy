1
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,200
Welcome, welcome, welcome to "Last Week Tonight."

2
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,800
I'm John Oliver. Thank you for being with us.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,200
Just time for a quick recap of the week.

4
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,800
On Friday, you may have felt a whiff of nostalgia in the air,

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,800
and I'm not talking about Ninja Turtles.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,520
I'm talking about this.

7
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,720
Good morning. The U.S. military is back in Iraq.

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,120
CHRISTI PAUL: Take a look at these images from
the U.S. military.

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,520
SA18 fighter jets closing in on an ISIS artillery unit

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,200
and then here it comes,
that massive explosion.

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,600
Yes, America is
bombing Iraq yet again,

12
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,200
and the world is experiencing
a little dj boom.

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,800
This time, though,
it is strictly

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,800
for humanitarian reasons,

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,800
to prevent the genocide
of the Yazidi people.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,800
And when he announced
the airstrikes,

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,600
the President was anxious
to make two things clear:

18
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,000
one--how this was
the right thing to do;

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,960
and two--how little
he wanted to do it.

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,960
I know that many of you
are rightly concerned

21
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,960
about any American
military action in Iraq,

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,560
even limited strikes like these.

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,800
I understand that.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,960
American combat troops will not
be returning to fight in Iraq.

25
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,760
I've got to say, the President sounds
a lot like a girl

26
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,960
who is trying to reassure her friends that she's
not getting back together

27
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,360
with the ex-boyfriend
that they all hate.

28
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,360
"Look, guys, look, guys, I'm just getting a drink
with Iraq, OK?

29
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,360
"He's having a really
tough time right now.

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,960
"I will not be returning back to his place,
although--you know what?

31
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,440
"Text me at 10:00 tonight and remind me that he was
a nightmare.

32
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,440
Remind me of that.
That's good for me to hear."

33
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,840
In fact, there was
really only one theme

34
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,960
that most people took away
from the speech.

35
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,360
A very reluctant
President Obama gave the order

36
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,200
for airstrikes
in Iraq last night.

37
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,880
President Obama has been
reluctant, to say the least.

38
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,760
He was reluctant to get in
and take action here.

39
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,760
CHUCK TODD: He seemed
very reluctant to do this,

40
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,680
extremely reluctant.

41
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,880
Oh, yes, reluctance.

42
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,480
It's always been the best tone
for leaders to use

43
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,960
when inspiring troops
before battle.

44
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,560
Who can forget Henry V's
immortal words?

45
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,960
"Once more into the breach,
dear friends,

46
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,160
"unfortunately because,
uh, obviously

47
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,760
"everyone would prefer
not to go into the breach.

48
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,960
"No, even by breach standards,
this breach is ghastly.

49
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,160
"Look, look, we all hate breaches, but we're
going into this one.

50
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,440
"We don't have to like it, we just have to get
this shit over with.

51
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,040
"Who's with me?
Charge! Charge!

52
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,320
Charge, I say! Charge, I say!"

53
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,480
Turning now, though, to
an even more lawless territory

54
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,880
than Iraq--the Internet.

55
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,280
There was news this week
that may affect

56
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,920
a huge number
of people on Earth.

57
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,720
A report this morning
claims a Russian gang

58
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,680
is holding a massive list
of stolen online records.

59
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,080
WOMAN: According to a Milwaukee
company called Hold Security,

60
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,280
the thieves stole 1.2 billion
usernames and passwords.

61
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,680
OK, OK, that is
clearly worrying,

62
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,880
but on the bright side,
that is also

63
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,800
the least threatening
Russian gang ever.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,800
"Give us what we want,

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,400
"or Dmitri here will poke
your ex-girlfriend on Fassbook.

66
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,400
He will do it."

67
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,200
The truly terrifying part
of this story

68
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
is not just the scale
of this theft,

69
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,160
it's what the solution
might have to be.

70
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,560
MAN: Assume that every password that you've got
is no longer safe,

71
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,160
and you should go through
and change them all.

72
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,600
CHARLIE ROSE: Just to underline that,
everybody should go

73
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,600
and change their passwords.

74
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,400
Yeah, I get that.

75
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,000
I get that I should
definitely change my password.

76
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,000
The problem is,
I'm not gonna do that...

77
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,600
because that sounds hard,
even though it isn't.

78
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,600
At the very least, it might involve me
having to remember answers

79
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,200
to security questions
from 12 years ago.

80
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,000
"What was my pet's name in 2002?

81
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,200
"Was it Kelly Barkson
or Hootie the Goldfish?

82
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,800
"Yeah. Oh, you know what?
It was Christina Aguilizard,

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,200
but I'm still not doing it.
I'm still not doing it."

84
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,800
Look, I get no one wants
to do this, so to help you,

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,800
we've actually come up
with a list of replacement words

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
that nobody, not even
a Russian gang,

87
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,600
will be able to guess.

88
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,000
Perfect passwords,
such as AlanAldaNewBatman.

89
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,000
No one is guessing that.
It's the perfect password.

90
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,000
That sequence of words has
never been inside anyone's head,

91
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,400
although now, to be honest, I
think he would be a good Batman.

92
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,000
I think it's a different way
to go with the character.

93
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,080
So instead, you might want to go with something like
PittsburghOlympics2024.

94
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,880
That's rock-solid.
It makes no sense.

95
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,080
It even feels weird
saying it out loud.

96
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,880
Here's a bunch more passwords running along the bottom
of your screen right now.

97
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,880
Help yourself to any of these.
None of them make sense.

98
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,880
There's lobsterbrownie,

99
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,880
JohnOliver=ChristianGrey,

100
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,880
just words that don't
belong together.

101
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
The point is you're covered.

102
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,680
But finally, turning
to the crisis in Gaza,

103
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,280
earlier this week,
everyone placed their hope

104
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,280
in the announcement of
a 72-hour cease-fire.

105
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,480
Good news?
The cease-fire held.

106
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,200
Bad news?
Then this happened.

107
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,200
The 3-day cease-fire between
Israel and Hamas is history.

108
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,200
The Israeli military says
rockets were fired into Israel

109
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,840
before the cease-fire
even ended.

110
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,840
Look, is it too much to ask
that the cease-fire in Gaza

111
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,440
last a little longer
than fucking Bonnaroo?

112
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,440
As of taping right now,

113
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,440
another cease-fire
has apparently begun.

114
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,440
We can all only hope
that it holds.

115
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,520
The problem is that even when leaders over there
start to sound hopeful,

116
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,920
the things they're hopeful about
are depressingly unambitious.

117
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,120
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU:
There are opportunities now to

118
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,720
be able to fashion
a new reality,

119
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,920
one more conducive to
the end of violence,

120
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,920
to the establishment
of calm, sustainable peace,

121
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,720
or at least
a sustainable quiet.

122
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,120
What? Did you see that?

123
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,920
He wished for peace and then
immediately bargained himself

124
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,880
back to "a sustainable quiet,"
which basically sounds

125
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,080
like a librarian walking around
the region shushing everyone.

126
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,160
"Shh! No rockets!
Shh! Shh!"

127
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,160
And if that weren't enough
to dispel any illusions

128
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,800
of imminent peace in the region,
there was also this.

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,800
WOMAN: A new app.
It's called "Bomb Gaza."

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,800
It allows users
to kill civilians

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,920
from the skies on your phone.

132
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,360
It's a game.

133
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,960
That's what I always thought
the problem with Gaza was--

134
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,360
no one had turned it
into a game yet.

135
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,640
It just wasn't fun until now.

136
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,040
Incredibly, there are games out there representing
both sides of this conflict.

137
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,040
On Rocket Pride, you can
fire rockets at Israel,

138
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
and on Gaza Assault Code Red,

139
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,960
you can pilot a drone and fire
on Palestinian towns.

140
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,760
Just think about that.

141
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,960
Someone could have been playing these games on
their commute to work,

142
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,960
while real rockets were being fired, going,
"Oh, shit, I missed my stop.

143
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,760
This is the worst thing that's
happened to anyone today!"

144
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,960
To be honest, war has always
been popular in video games.

145
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,560
The nuances
of diplomacy, however,

146
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,960
they've never held quite
the same appeal.

147
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,320
That is, until now.

148
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,120
ANNOUNCER: You've fought
terrorists in "Call of Duty"

149
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,120
and alien hordes
in "Gears of War."

150
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,920
Well, now get ready for
the opposite of that.

151
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,920
MAN: OK, first up on the agenda,
Paragraph 3, Subsection 4--

152
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,720
"Retention of Previously
Agreed-Upon Language."

153
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,800
ANNOUNCER: "World of Peacecraft."

154
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,800
Critics are already calling it
"Uncomfortably boring"

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,800
and "Off-puttingly complicated."

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,400
"World of Peacecraft" features all the heart-pounding
excitement

157
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,200
of trilateral talks in a variety of
international settings,

158
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,200
from Russian conference rooms
to Pakistani conference rooms

159
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,360
to Israeli conference rooms

160
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,800
and back to Russian
conference rooms.

161
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,360
Are you ready
for non-stop sitting,

162
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,560
incessant talking,
and incremental progress,

163
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,960
all while trying to escape
the creeping sense

164
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,160
that your presence may be doing
more harm than good?

165
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,160
IGN says,
"Jesus, this is bleak,"

166
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,960
and "Official XBOX Magazine" raves, "I honestly would
prefer war to this."

167
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:48,800
Madeleine Albright says, "Yeah, that's pretty much
what it's like."

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,200
ANNOUNCER:
"World of Peacecraft"...

169
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,600
Moving on, moving on.

170
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,680
For our main story tonight,

171
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,880
we're going to look at one of America's most
resilient industries--

172
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,480
payday loans.

173
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,880
One in 20 households have
taken one out at some point.

174
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,080
It's a $9 billion industry,

175
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,800
and payday loan outlets
are all over the place.

176
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,600
MAN: There are more
payday loan stores

177
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
in America than Starbucks

178
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,800
and McDonald's.

179
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,800
More than Starbucks
or McDonald's.

180
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,800
McDonald's!

181
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,800
I didn't know there was more of anything in the U.S.
than McDonald's,

182
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
including people
and grains of sand.

183
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,600
And the payday loan industry
has only been around

184
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
for just over 20 years.

185
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,800
Even Ebola looks at
that growth rate and thinks,

186
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,800
"That's impressive.
You guys spread fast."

187
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,800
And it's not just the number
of companies, it's the variety.

188
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,800
You've got Fastcash,
Cashcentral, Speedy Cash,

189
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,800
Quik Cash with the word
"quick" spelled wrong,

190
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and Kwik Kash, with both "quick"
and "cash" spelled wrong,

191
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,800
'cause what could be more
reassuring than a business

192
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,200
that can't correctly spell
either their product

193
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,400
or the speed at which they're
getting it to you?

194
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,800
There are so many different options that there are even
services to help match you

195
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,920
to a lender, and you cannot
have avoided these ads.

196
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,000
Hi. Montel here.
I'm Montel Williams.

197
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,920
Hi, I'm Montel Williams
for Money Mutual.

198
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,880
Call or go to Moneymutual.com.

199
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,880
Get up to a thousand dollars in your checking account
by tomorrow.

200
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,880
That car repair bill? Paid.

201
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,680
The medical emergency? Handled.

202
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,000
Extra cash
until payday? Done.

203
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,400
"Done."

204
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,400
Thanks, Montel.
Quick question, though.

205
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,400
How the hell are you
a financial spokesman?

206
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,200
"Hey, hey, everyone, isn't that
the guy who did that episode

207
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,800
"on how it's hard to be
the less pretty conjoined twin?

208
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,600
Everybody be quiet. This guy might have some pretty sound
financial advice."

209
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,400
When something is this popular
and this prevalent,

210
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,800
you owe it to yourself to find out exactly what
it is, much in the way :

211
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,280
that I finally gave in and read
all 4 "Twilight" books.

212
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,280
I'm on Team Bella,
by the way.

213
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,080
Team Bella. She doesn't need
a man to define her.

214
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,480
Team Bella, OK?
I'm on Team Bella.

215
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,880
Bella.

216
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:18,120
That's not the point. The point is, what is
a payday loan?

217
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,920
What is a payday loan?

218
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,520
A payday loan is a quick way to
get the cash you need to cover

219
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,520
an unexpected expense, like
a car repair or doctor bill.

220
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,920
It's called a payday loan
because the loan balance

221
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,600
is typically due
on your next payday.

222
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,200
Oh, that does makes sense.

223
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,000
I thought it was a loan that you repaid
in PayDay candy bars.

224
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,400
Your way's better.
Your way is better than mine.

225
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,400
Clearly, this lady is
psychotically friendly

226
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,400
and also seems to have
an appealing product,

227
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,840
so how much might a company
charge for this sort of service?

228
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,680
Often it's 300 or 400 percentage
points on an annual basis.

229
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,920
Average annual rates
of 570%.

230
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,840
Some of those rates legally
are as high as 1,900% a year.

231
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,840
1,900%.

232
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,840
Even the most demanding,
abusive football coaches

233
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,840
only ask for 110.

234
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,640
"Hit him in the mouth, Billy!
Hit him in the mouth!"

235
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,240
Now, to be fair,

236
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,840
payday loan companies will say
these are short-term loans,

237
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,240
so an annual percentage rate
doesn't apply, which is true

238
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,840
if you pay them off immediately,

239
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,840
but many customers don't.

240
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,040
One study showed that 3/4
of the industry's volume

241
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,440
was generated by borrowers
who have to re-borrow

242
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,440
before their next pay period.

243
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,640
Basically, payday loans are the
Lay's potato chips of finance.

244
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,040
You can't have just one,
and they're terrible for you.

245
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,240
And it's when you start
missing payments

246
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,840
that you're susceptible not just to frightening
levels of interest,

247
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,280
but also to fees that you
may not have been aware of.

248
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,960
I was, like, I'd say
maybe $6,000, like, deep.

249
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,560
You know, every payday,
I was here.

250
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,240
Every time I got paid, I would pay it off and I
would get another one.

251
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,840
An endless cycle, a dead end.

252
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,440
I would advise anybody not to.

253
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,840
MAN: I'd borrow 250,
I thought I would pay 325.

254
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,840
I actually paid $700,

255
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,440
but it would have been $1,100

256
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,280
had I not gone to the bank
and put a stop to this.

257
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,880
$1,100.

258
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,880
It is not often that
a metaphorical slippery slope

259
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,480
cost as much as
an actual ski vacation.

260
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,880
Payday loan companies
present themselves as a way

261
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,880
for you to get back
onto your feet.

262
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,880
They don't want you
to get trapped in debt.

263
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,680
In fact, they'll help you
if you fall behind.

264
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,640
Remember the friendly
ACE Cash lady from before?

265
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,680
What happens if you can't
pay back your loan?

266
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,080
Sometimes people have
a hard time paying us back,

267
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,920
and we'll be there to work
with you if that should happen.

268
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,600
Yeah, no shit you'll
be there for them.

269
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,600
Your business model depends on it

270
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,000
because an actual ACE Cash
training manual for employees

271
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,960
featured a diagram which starts

272
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,160
with a customer applying

273
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,360
for an ACE loan,

274
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,760
moves through them spending

275
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
the money on that loan,

276
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,760
being unable to pay it back,

277
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,360
and then being forced to apply

278
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,120
for an ACE loan again.

279
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,120
You'll notice that has
a certain roundness to it.

280
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,920
It's basically a recycling
symbol for human misery.

281
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,920
It's the circle of debt

282
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,520
And it screws us all

283
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,320
Now, obviously we must not generalize
about this shitty industry.

284
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,920
Some companies hold themselves
to a higher standard.

285
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,720
In fact, the Community Financial
Services Association of America

286
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,120
insists that their
members are different

287
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,720
from the shadier elements
of the industry.

288
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,120
They even brag about it

289
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,640
in one of the most boring
videos on the Internet.

290
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,840
In our industry,
I mean, let's be honest.

291
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,240
There are some
companies out there

292
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,640
that don't even
follow the law,

293
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,840
let alone follow
a standard

294
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,880
of best practices like
our member companies do.

295
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,880
"Oh, those other
companies are awful.

296
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,880
"Our member companies are
pillars of the community.

297
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,880
"Did you know that one of them gave a kidney to a little girl
in a hospital?

298
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,480
"She was in there for tonsillitis, but now
she has 3 kidneys.

299
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,680
We're good companies."

300
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,280
So let's take a look at their wonderful members
and their best practices.

301
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,280
First there's Advance America,

302
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,280
one of the biggest companies
in the industry,

303
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,880
whose co-founder defends
his business like this.

304
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,880
The consumer demand

305
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,880
for the product is overwhelming

306
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,680
and speaks for itself.

307
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,080
OK, that's fair, although it's
also worth pointing out

308
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,280
that the customer demand
for heroin is also overwhelming,

309
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,280
and that doesn't mean it's a product you'd
necessarily recommend

310
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,680
to your friends
to get them out of a jam.

311
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,080
Advance America is a company

312
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,040
whose best practices
somehow include

313
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,640
agreeing to an $18.75 million
settlement in North Carolina

314
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,840
after they were accused of
illegally high interest rates.

315
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,240
But they're just one

316
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,640
of the two largest companies
in the business.

317
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,840
The other company is
Cash America.

318
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,960
OK, so how do they practice
their best practices?

319
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,360
MAN: Cash America was ordered to pay $19 million in refunds
and fines late last year

320
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,400
for illegally overcharging service members and for
destroying documents.

321
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Say what you like about that.

322
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,800
Illegally overcharging
service members

323
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,200
is a ballsy business practice.

324
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,800
They must have been the ones driving around
with those bumper stickers

325
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,200
that say, "Extort Our Troops."

326
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,800
But settlements like those are
actually something of a rarity,

327
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,800
and that brings us to why
the payday loan industry

328
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,800
is seemingly unstoppable.

329
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,800
They are incredibly good
at avoiding regulation.

330
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,800
Just look at
one example in Texas.

331
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,200
They actually tried to rein in the payday loan industry there
a few years ago,

332
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,320
but they faced opposition from
one particular state legislator.

333
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,400
Members, I just cannot see why
this legislation

334
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,600
could possibly be necessary

335
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,400
unless it is
the big institutions

336
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,240
trying to squeeze
the little guys.

337
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,240
And the "little guys"
in his analogy

338
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,240
are payday loan companies,

339
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,800
although I've got to say, if you spell "little guys" with
a dollar sign instead of an "s,"

340
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,200
you've got yourself a pretty good name for
a store right there.

341
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,800
That man is Texas State
Representative Gary Elkins,

342
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and his proud defense
of the little guy

343
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,800
is about to get
a little muddier.

344
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,600
WOMAN: But isn't it true
that you have 12 very successful

345
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,680
payday and title loan locations
across this state?

346
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,880
Let me answer
that question for him.

347
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,080
It is true. It is true.

348
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:52,280
He does, and they include an outpost of the wonderfully
named Power Finance Texas.

349
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,280
"Can I interest y'all
in some power finance?"

350
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,280
But I apologize.

351
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,880
I interrupted.

352
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,480
WOMAN: Isn't it true... ELKINS: But we don't need
this regulation.

353
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,680
WOMAN: that you stand to add
to your personal wealth

354
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,280
considerably by killing
these bills?

355
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,880
You know what? That--
that is not about the bill.

356
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,600
WOMAN: Mr. Elkins, do you know the meaning of the term
"conflict of interest"?

357
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,600
"Oh, it's--do I know it?

358
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,000
Why, Madam, I am the physical embodiment of that term
at this very moment."

359
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,880
Now, you might be thinking
that that woman,

360
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,680
Vicki Truitt, is awesome.

361
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,680
You know, fearlessly calling out
how the payday loan industry

362
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,080
influences politicians, which is why it's going
to be so hard to tell you

363
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,960
that just 17 days
after leaving office,

364
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,160
she signed on as a lobbyist
for ACE Cash Express--

365
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,760
you know, the circle people.

366
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,760
Now, thankfully, Texas also has
a finance commission

367
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,160
which oversees
the payday loan industry.

368
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,320
Guess who runs that.

369
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,120
William J. White is
vice president of Cash America

370
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,920
and was also appointed
by the governor

371
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,520
as chairman of the state's finance commission,

372
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,880
which oversees
payday loan outfits.

373
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,280
That's right.

374
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,880
The chairman of the commission

375
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,880
that oversees
the payday loan industry

376
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,880
is also, at the same time,
a vice president

377
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,880
of one of the biggest payday
loan companies in the country.

378
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,880
I call dingo.
I call dingo on that man.

379
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,280
I call dingo on him!
I call dingo!

380
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,880
Dingo, dingo, dingo!

381
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,880
So let's just quickly
break all of that down.

382
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,880
If you are hoping to protect Texans from the
payday loan industry,

383
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,280
you would need to approach a commission overseen
by the vice president

384
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,880
of a payday loan company
and then introduce a bill

385
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,880
into the state legislature, where the owner
of 12 payday loan stores

386
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,280
will debate the merits of
the payday loan industry

387
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,280
with one of the payday loan industry's future
fucking lobbyists.

388
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,480
Apparently even cluster fucks
are bigger in Texas.

389
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,680
But the truly chilling skill
payday loan companies have

390
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,680
is not how they prevent
legislation from getting passed.

391
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,080
It's how they react
when it gets through.

392
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,280
For instance, when Illinois passed an act which applied
to loans of up to 120 days,

393
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,280
companies simply began offering loans with terms
of 121 days instead,

394
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,080
which is like betting a dollar
on "The Price Is Right."

395
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,680
You're technically allowed
to do it, but, you know,

396
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,880
fuck you!

397
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,880
Now, it gets worse.

398
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,680
When Arizona outlawed
payday loans,

399
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,880
many companies shifted
to selling title loans instead,

400
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,680
which are basically the same, except they also get
to take your car.

401
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,440
For regulators,

402
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,880
it's like playing
legislative Whack-a-Mole.

403
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,880
Just when you think you've
squashed them down,

404
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,680
somewhere up they pop up
somewhere else,

405
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,880
wearing a completely
different outfit.

406
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
And the most amazing example

407
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,320
of all of this
took place in Ohio.

408
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,920
In 2008, they somehow capped
payday loan rates at 28%.

409
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,320
Any company licensed as a short-term lender had
to abide by that.

410
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,400
But, where one mole falls,

411
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,800
another mole shall rise.

412
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,800
And as of last year,

413
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,800
there were no businesses in Ohio
licensed to short-term lenders.

414
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,600
There was, however,
a sudden increase of companies

415
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
registering as mortgage lenders,

416
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,200
offering people short-term
mortgages of around $300.

417
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,800
Watch now

418
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,200
as the lawyer for
a company called Cashland

419
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,520
explains this to a judge.

420
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,920
JUDGE: So Cashland
would not be subject, then,

421
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,680
to the Short-Term Loan Act

422
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,680
because it's not registered
as a short-term lender?

423
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,080
MAN: Exactly, Your Honor.

424
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,480
The Short-Term Loan Act by
the legislative enactment says

425
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:44,160
it applies only to those who register under
the Short-Term Loan Act.

426
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,160
Why even bother calling
yourselves mortgage lenders?

427
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,760
Why not just call yourselves
Peanut Butter Octopus Companies?

428
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,160
Yeah. You can't regulate
peanut butter octopi.

429
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,760
They don't technically exist.

430
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,760
And in the rare case

431
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,160
where states succeed in imposing
stringent regulations,

432
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,320
some payday loan companies have
one final trick up their sleeve.

433
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,920
Now, some payday lenders
have found a loophole

434
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,520
by partnering with
Indian tribes.

435
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,720
That gives payday lenders
the cover of sovereign immunity

436
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,920
to avoid state regulations.

437
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,920
That's right.

438
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,920
Some payday lenders are
currently dressing themselves up

439
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,720
as Native Americans.

440
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,720
I thought only Johnny Depp
was allowed to do that.

441
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,560
How does that even work?

442
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,160
MAN: This payday lender,
Cash Fairy, has teamed up

443
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,960
with the Fort Belknap
Indian tribe in Montana,

444
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,360
and as you can see,
they are charging

445
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,360
online interest rates
in the 700% range.

446
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,360
SECOND MAN: If you can become
affiliated with a tribe

447
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,360
and be able to avert local
and state laws, in my opinion,

448
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,040
apparently loan-sharking is
still legal in this country.

449
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,640
It's true, although
let's be fair.

450
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,840
No loan shark would ever go by
the name Cash Fairy.

451
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,840
"Hey, hey, you better get me
that money by midnight,

452
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,640
"or you're gonna get a visit
from the Cash Fairy.

453
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,040
The Cash Fairy."

454
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,040
Here's the problem.

455
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,840
Payday loan companies
are almost impossible

456
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,440
to effectively regulate,
and they are not going anywhere.

457
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,840
A Pew survey found that
a majority of borrowers said

458
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,240
payday loans take advantage of
them, but a majority also said

459
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,440
they provide relief, and that is
why they are so dangerous.

460
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,040
People sometimes need them,
but you have to be

461
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,840
absolutely sure there are
no better options.

462
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,240
Apparently 41% of those surveyed
who'd taken out payday loans

463
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,040
ended up having to borrow
from family or pawn possessions

464
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,440
or other things that they could
have done in the first place,

465
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,040
just to pay off
that payday loan.

466
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,840
And yet, payday loans
superficially do look easier.

467
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,440
All these commercials,
they're enticing

468
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,840
and they're also everywhere.

469
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,040
The least we can do is
launch a counter-campaign

470
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,120
with a celebrity spokesperson
of our own to remind people

471
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,640
to make sure they explore all
their better options first.

472
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,640
Hi, I'm Sarah Silverman.

473
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,040
If you're considering
taking out a payday loan,

474
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,840
I'd like to tell you about
a great alternative.

475
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,240
It's called Anything Else.

476
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,240
The way it works is, instead
of taking out a payday loan,

477
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,720
you literally do
anything else.

478
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,120
Sell your sperm.
Sell some blood.

479
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,520
Throw yourself in front
of a rich guy's car.

480
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,800
He'll throw money at the problem
just to make that shit go away.

481
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,160
Are you an old person
and need money?

482
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,160
Take things. You're old.

483
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,920
No one's gonna stop you.
You're not gonna go to jail.

484
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,520
Go to the grocery store
right now, fill up a cart

485
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,920
with everything you need,
and walk the fuck outta there.

486
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,720
You know what? People will
pay you to pee on them.

487
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,480
That's true. Doodies, too.
Doodies are more, like double.

488
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,880
I know this for a fact.
I...

489
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,600
It doesn't matter, but it's something that you have to do
every day anyway, right?

490
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,600
By not doing it, you are literally flushing money
down the toilet.

491
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,880
It's irresponsible.
There's money inside of you.

492
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,440
It's like Dorothy having the power to go home
the whole time.

493
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,440
The point is, no decision
in your life will be worse

494
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,440
than dealing with these
payday loan motherfuckers.

495
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,840
They're motherfuckers.

496
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,840
They're fuckers of mothers.

497
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,840
So if you're thinking
about getting a payday loan,

498
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,840
just simply pick up the phone,

499
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,440
then put it down again
and do literally anything else.

500
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,840
Do it now.

501
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,440
Finally tonight,
finally tonight, Russia.

502
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,640
Ever since their
annexation of Crimea,

503
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,240
sanctions between Russia and
America have been escalating,

504
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,120
and this week, they took
tensions to a brand-new level.

505
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,320
WOMAN: First, the foreign minister
tweeted pictures

506
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,320
of President Putin
holding a cheetah

507
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,520
and President Obama
holding a poodle,

508
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,920
and then there is this--
a laser light show in Moscow

509
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,920
showing President Obama
eating a banana

510
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,160
and also wishing him
happy birthday.

511
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,960
OK.

512
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,360
To be honest, if you
told me 50 years ago

513
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,760
that Russia would one day attack
the United States with lasers,

514
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,760
this would not have been
what I was expecting.

515
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,760
Also, also,

516
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,960
to be honest, that was not the work of
the Russian government.

517
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,360
It was a bunch of Russian students, presumably from
their racist A.V. Club.

518
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,960
This, however, was
the Russian government.

519
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,960
Putin has banned food imports
to Russia, for one year,

520
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,160
including fruit and
vegetables from Europe,

521
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,760
beef and pork from Australia, and soybeans and chicken
from the U.S.

522
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

523
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,560
Putin doesn't want
our soybeans and chicken?

524
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,960
Slow your roll, Russia, 'cause
let's get one thing clear here.

525
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,560
You break up with
our chicken and soybeans,

526
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,960
the relationship is over, OK?

527
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,360
Our chickens and
soybeans are single.

528
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,360
They're free to roam,
which they're gonna want to.

529
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,960
Some of them have been kept in appalling conditions, but
that's not the point here.

530
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,360
That's not the point.

531
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,360
The point is, they are free
to get right up

532
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,360
in the mouth
of whoever they want to.

533
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,800
I'm warning you, Russia,
I'll put U.S. chicken

534
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,400
on Tinder right now.

535
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,880
There it is.
This is real.

536
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,880
Check Tinder right now.
It's actually there.

537
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,080
Some pervert with
a chicken fetish

538
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,080
just hit the fucking jackpot.

539
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,280
As for soybeans,
they're already on Grindr.

540
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,280
That's right.
Soybeans are gay.

541
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,280
Soybeans are gay. How is that
a surprise to people?

542
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,880
But I'm not
just gonna tell you

543
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,280
what you're giving up
with these sanctions, Russia.

544
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,880
I'm gonna show you.
Come on out here, chicken.

545
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,280
Come on out.

546
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,880
And don't look away, Russia,

547
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,880
because look who is single

548
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,880
and ready to mingle.

549
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,480
Oh, yeah.

550
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,880
Work that pole
like a rotisserie,

551
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,880
you dirty bird.

552
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,280
Look, don't touch,
Russia.

553
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,000
You don't want this,
remember?

554
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,360
The party fowl
is on the prowl.

555
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,960
And--uh-oh, uh-oh!

556
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,960
For you vegetarians
out there,

557
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,960
we've got a little treat
out here on the main stage.

558
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,600
Edamame, oh, my.

559
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,000
Russia, you just gave up a utility bean.

560
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,200
Oh, yeah.
Look at him.

561
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,800
This bean is so hot,
he's steaming himself.

562
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,200
Drop the sanctions, Russia.
Drop the sanctions.

563
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,200
That's it for
our show this week.

564
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,200
Our thanks
to Sarah Silverman,

565
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,480
plus the proud American chicken
and soybean.

566
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:23,160
We'll see you next week.

567
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,480
Payday loan mofos.

568
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,480
Payday loan...

569
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,080
pussy lickers.

570
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,680
What about the pay--um,

571
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,680
instead of payday loan
motherfuckers,

572
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,640
payday loan cunts?

573
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,880
Suck a dick. Suck a dick.

574
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,640
Suck a dick.

575
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:46,480
That was genius.
