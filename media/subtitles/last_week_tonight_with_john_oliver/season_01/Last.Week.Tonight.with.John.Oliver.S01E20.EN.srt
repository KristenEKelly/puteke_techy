1
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,880
Welcome, welcome, welcome to "Last Week Tonight."

2
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,880
I'm John Oliver. Thank you for being with us.

3
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,880
Just time for a quick recap of the week,

4
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,920
and we begin in Hong Kong.

5
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,040
The former British colony now back under Chinese rule.

6
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,280
All week, protesters have been in the streets,

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,400
angry at the Chinese government's announcement

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,960
that they would be pre-selecting all candidates

9
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,960
for Hong Kong's 2017 elections.

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,120
And Hong Kong is in an odd situation.

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,360
It's a limited democracy inside a Communist country,

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,840
a setup that their own
constitution describes

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,640
as one country, two systems.

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,280
It's like the two girls,
one cup of governance,

15
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,400
with one girl having
a lot more control

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,000
over what happens to that cup.

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,920
The protests have been notable

18
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,240
not just for their size,
but also for their tone.

19
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,040
MALE REPORTER: This is one of
the most peaceful and polite

20
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,960
mass protests
I've ever covered.

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,880
There's an enormous amount
of housekeeping being done.

22
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,480
These are extremely
polite protesters.

23
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,600
There were all these signs that were
really, I thought,

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,680
really kind of cute
and really told you

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,080
about the Hong Kong
protestor.

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,400
It would say something like, you
know, fighting for democracy,

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,360
you know, apologies
for the inconvenience.

28
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,320
Ooh. It seems Hong Kong may have
left the British empire,

29
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,680
but we clearly left
our manners behind.

30
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,160
We'd very much like
to rise up against

31
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,240
the great state of China but
certainly wouldn't want to cause

32
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,440
a mess while we're doing it.

33
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,240
Scrub a dub dub.
What? What?

34
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,280
The ingenuity of the protestors
has also been striking.

35
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,600
Not only have they repelled
pepper spray with umbrellas,

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,440
but when the government
cracked down on communication,

37
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,840
they found a workaround.

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,280
Protestors are using
an app called Fire Chat,

39
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,680
which was developed
here in San Francisco

40
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,880
for people who want to exchange
text messages via Bluetooth.

41
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,680
It's intended for use
at off-the-grid events,

42
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,560
things like Burning Man
or Coachella.

43
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,440
Yes, the Hong Kong protestors
have achieved the impossible,

44
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,920
making something
featuring the words

45
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,640
"Bluetooth," "Burning Man,"

46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,120
and "Coachella"
not incredibly annoying.

47
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,440
Although, I do have to say, if
I was going to use any invention

48
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,680
from Burning Man to fight
the Chinese government,

49
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,880
I definitely would've gone with
the 8-armed metal fire beast.

50
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,400
Not even a Chinese tank is gonna
take on the pyroctopus.

51
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,920
Moving on.
Brazil went to the polls today.

52
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,760
They're voting in presidential
and local elections,

53
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,120
and turnout is expected
to be extremely high,

54
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,480
for one interesting reason.

55
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,240
FEMALE REPORTER: Voting is
obligatory in Brazil.

56
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,880
Yes, it's basically illegal
not to vote in Brazil.

57
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,240
A well-intentioned law.
The problem is,

58
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,520
when you make something
obligatory, people resent it.

59
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,880
And when they resent it,
they fuck with it,

60
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,600
which has led to
a proud tradition

61
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,920
of joke protest candidates
in Brazil, going back to 1959,

62
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,000
when Sao Paulo actually
elected a rhinoceros

63
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,080
to the city council.

64
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,960
Now--yes.
Now, her ballots,

65
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,880
her ballots were
sadly disqualified

66
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,400
after they realized
what had happened,

67
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,840
so the second place candidate
took office--

68
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,880
a penguin in a bowler hat.

69
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,800
Now, the beauty is
candidates even get

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,200
free airtime on Brazilian TV,

71
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,480
whether they are
joke candidates or not,

72
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,200
so election season this year
has been spectacular,

73
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,560
thanks to candidates
like Jesus, Satan,

74
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,800
and of course, Osama bin Laden,

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,080
as well as multiple
President Obama impersonators,

76
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,920
one of whom looks almost
bizarrely not like Barack Obama.

77
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,960
Who is he trying to appeal to?

78
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,280
I'm really trying to win voters
who love Barack Obama

79
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,680
but who are also racist enough
to think that I look like him.

80
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,760
That's my demo.

81
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,080
But perhaps my favorite
candidate this year is this guy.

82
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,440
Paulo Batista, who seems
to be running on a platform

83
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,240
of having laser vision that
can transform the country,

84
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,720
and who ends the ad
by flying through space

85
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,920
for 20 solid seconds.

86
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,880
We have not edited this.

87
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,840
This is genuinely how
his campaign ad ends.

88
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,520
He's hurtling through space,

89
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,080
hypnotizing you
into voting for him.

90
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,680
And that is how you win over
undecided voters right there.

91
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,640
So let's all remember these.

92
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,120
Let's all remember these ads

93
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,800
the next time someone
complains to you

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,920
about the craziness of
America's political ads.

95
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,200
Because until we are choosing
between Jesus, Satan,

96
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,720
and a hypnotic Superman,

97
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,800
we are not as strange
as we think we are.

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,720
And finally this week,
there was some important news

99
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,680
from the world of sports.

100
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,160
All we know about the 2022
Winter Olympics is

101
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,920
they will be held in an interesting
and challenging place.

102
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,480
Norway has dropped out,
meaning the only two places

103
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,640
left in the running are Beijing
and a resort in Kazakhstan.

104
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,800
Oh, for fuck's sake, Norway,
how can you pull out?

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,160
The only reason we have
winter Olympics

106
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,120
is so you freakish snow people

107
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,880
can pick up your stupid
cross-country skiing medals.

108
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,720
And the problem is, neither
China nor Kazakhstan

109
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,160
are appealing alternatives.

110
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,440
Both have appalling
human rights records,

111
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,880
Beijing doesn't even have
a mountain suitable for skiing

112
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,920
within 50 miles of it,

113
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,920
and if they have it
in Kazakhstan,

114
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
we're all gonna
have to listen to

115
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,280
two weeks of Borat impressions

116
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,720
from America's
foremost douchebags.

117
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,800
"Is nice,
Winter Olympics?"

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,400
Yes, it's nice. Yes.

119
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,920
It's nice.
I get it.

120
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,680
And Norway is not alone in not
wanting to host the Olympics.

121
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,600
Ukraine, Poland, and Sweden have
also pulled out of their bids.

122
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,200
BRIAN WILLIAMS: The Associated
Press is calling 2022

123
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,800
the Olympics no one
seems to want.

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,800
Wherever it is, they'll be
televised by NBC.

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,920
We get--we get--you do--
You genuinely get the sense

126
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,600
if they just widened
the shot out just slightly,

127
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,360
you'd have seen Brian Williams
making the jerk-off hand motion.

128
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,120
Whatever it is, it will be
televised on NBC.

129
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,760
What am I doing here?
Get me out of this place.

130
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,560
So, just out of interest, what
happened with the Norwegian bid?

131
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,920
How did a country that
makes socks like these

132
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,880
suddenly get cold feet?

133
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,720
Well, it turns out

134
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,160
it might have something
to do with the IOC's

135
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,720
7,000 pages of
host nation demands,

136
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,760
including, and these
are all real,

137
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,800
a demand to be presented
to the king,

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,440
that the hotel's minibar must be
stocked with Coke products,

139
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,760
and that members
should be greeted

140
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,640
with a smiling, positive,
and welcoming staff,

141
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,800
and with seasonal
fruits and pastries

142
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,320
waiting for them
in their hotel rooms.

143
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,360
Incidentally, what the fuck

144
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,800
is a seasonal pastry
in Oslo in February?

145
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,800
I'm guessing it's something like
a herring with vanilla frosting.

146
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,280
Look, look, I get why Norway

147
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,800
doesn't want to deal
with all this.

148
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,640
But someone has to, or China or
Kazakhstan are going to win,

149
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,640
and that is why tonight,
I'm proud to say

150
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,040
we are officially
announcing our bid

151
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,200
to host the 2022
Winter Olympics

152
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,800
right here in the "Last Week
Tonight" studio.

153
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,200
Sure. Sure.

154
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,920
We're not a world-class
ski destination.

155
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,440
We're a TV show filmed
in a small studio

156
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,160
in New York's historic
carjacking district.

157
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,200
But we will meet all of
the IOC's demands.

158
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,240
First, here is your fridge
full of Coke products.

159
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,640
Look, there's even
Fresca in there--

160
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,560
the soda that's like having a
grapefruit shit in your mouth.

161
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,880
And I know that you
want to be greeted by

162
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,840
a contractually mandated smile.

163
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,160
Here you go.
Look at her.

164
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,560
She hates you,
and you'd barely know.

165
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,200
And sure, we may not have
the greatest facilities

166
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,200
for an international
winter-sports event,

167
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,800
but we do have exactly
as many ski mountains

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,760
as the entire city of Beijing,

169
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,200
and we also have this combined

170
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,280
ice rink, ski slope,
and bobsled track.

171
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,120
Also, we even have a second
fridge of Coke products.

172
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,640
This one has
Vanilla Coke in it.

173
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,640
It's like drinking
a Glade Plug-In.

174
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,800
And while we may not have
a king for you to meet,

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,960
we've got something even better:

176
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,880
a King Charles spaniel
dressed as a king.

177
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,320
He's a good boy.
He's a very good boy.

178
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,360
And don't worry about
Olympic mascots.

179
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,400
We already have two!

180
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,040
A Scottish unicorn
and a horny space gecko!

181
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,880
So come on, IOC!
Come on!

182
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,800
Hosting the Olympics here
makes exactly as much sense

183
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,440
as Beijing and Kazakhstan,

184
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,800
and we have a much better
human rights record

185
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,400
than at least one of those!

186
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,960
"Last Week Tonight"
Olympics 2022! Yes!

187
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,560
And now this.

188
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,240
MAN: And now "Last Week
Tonight" asks...

189
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,360
This week, Columbus Day.
How is this still a thing?

190
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,880
America has a lot of solemn
holiday traditions,

191
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,760
from saluting the quiet dignity
of the Irish

192
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,760
to proudly celebrating
our birth as a nation

193
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,800
to just spending quality time
with family at Thanksgiving.

194
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,800
But next week brings
perhaps the strangest

195
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,440
of American holidays--
Columbus Day,

196
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,880
which brings with it
the beloved annual traditions

197
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,680
of cheesy local commercials.

198
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,320
In 1492, Columbus sailed
the ocean blue

199
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,280
to celebrate Mattress Depot.

200
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,560
MAN: And Americans turning up to

201
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,920
an unexpectedly closed
post office

202
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,560
and going, "Oh, yeah,
it's Columbus Day. Shit."

203
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,080
This proud holiday commemorates

204
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,680
the landing of
Christopher Columbus

205
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,080
in the Bahamas in 1492,

206
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,120
beginning a long tradition
of obnoxious white people

207
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,960
visiting Caribbean islands and
acting like they own the place.

208
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,960
In school, American children

209
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,440
learn about
Christopher Columbus' life.

210
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,960
I will discover a
shortcut to India.

211
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,520
We'll call this part of
India San Salvador.

212
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,400
MAN: Of course, what they
tend not to learn

213
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,360
are the parts of Columbus' life

214
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,400
where he kidnapped
Native Americans

215
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,360
and sold them into slavery,

216
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,440
had his men
slice them to pieces,

217
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,040
and through disease and warfare

218
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,080
killed roughly half
the population of Haiti.

219
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:55,520
But in fairness, none of that
rhymes with "In 1492."

220
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,480
Nevertheless, Columbus became
famous for his discoveries.

221
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,240
Specifically, the discovery
that you can

222
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,920
discover a continent

223
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,720
with millions of people
already living on it

224
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,560
that had also been
visited by Vikings

225
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,840
around 500 years earlier.

226
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,240
In fact, many U.S.
states and cities

227
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,840
no longer recognize
Columbus Day,

228
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,480
raising the question, why do
the rest of us still do it?

229
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,720
Sure, it's a chance for Italians
to celebrate their heritage,

230
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,200
but there are so many other
heroes they could celebrate.

231
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,800
Why not Frank Sinatra Day?

232
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,360
He killed no Native Americans
that we know of.

233
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,880
Or Mario Batali.

234
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,880
If he's killed anyone,
it's through cheese.

235
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,840
Or Al Pacino Day, a day that
would probably start well

236
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,640
and end as an overblown
parody of itself.

237
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,360
She's got
a great ass!

238
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,960
MAN: So America's
least-favorite holiday

239
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,280
commemorates a murderous
egomaniac

240
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,480
whose most famous discovery
was a case of getting lost

241
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,960
and refusing to ask directions.

242
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,840
All of which is enough
to make you wonder,

243
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,160
Columbus Day.

244
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
Moving on.

245
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,800
Our main story tonight,
the police.

246
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
They protect us,
they serve us,

247
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,760
and they provide us
with an endless source

248
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,200
of TV show one-liners.

249
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,440
Rock, paper,
scissors, gun.

250
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,880
Well, I'm no
Serena Williams,

251
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,160
but I know
one thing.

252
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,840
It's all
in the wrist.

253
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,080
Who'd want to cut
your penis off?

254
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,080
Take a number.

255
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,040
OK, now, you laugh,
but admit it,

256
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,360
you want to watch the rest
of that episode right now.

257
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,880
Now, look, public trust
in the police

258
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,960
is one of the most vital
elements in a civilized society.

259
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,840
But for many Americans,
that trust has been undermined

260
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,360
by a procedure called
civil forfeiture.

261
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,600
Now, I know it sounds like

262
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,120
a Gwyneth Paltrow
euphemism for divorce.

263
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,440
But incredibly, it's
actually even worse than that.

264
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,880
Civil asset forfeiture is
really a mechanism by which

265
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,880
the state and federal government can seize people's property

266
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,840
without having to
convict them of a crime.

267
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,520
Most people can't afford to hire
a lawyer to challenge it.

268
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,400
It's really legalized robbery
by law enforcement.

269
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,200
And think about it.
That is a tough crime

270
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,160
to report to the police.

271
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,600
Give me a description of
what the guy looked like.

272
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,560
Well, to be honest,
he looked a lot like the guy

273
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,440
currently asking me
what the guy looked like.

274
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,320
And if you think
this sounds bad,

275
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,440
just wait until you
see how it looks,

276
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,280
because the "Washington Post"
recently published

277
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,960
a major investigation
featuring stories like that of

278
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,280
this man, who was driving from
Michigan to San Francisco

279
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,480
with $2,400 in cash that his dad
had lent him to start a new job,

280
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,360
when he was
pulled over in Nevada.

281
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,120
I gave him my license
and registration, and then,

282
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,800
as he was looking
at that information,

283
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,920
he asked me how much money
I was traveling with.

284
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,600
MALE REPORTER: Lee told him about the money
his dad gave him,

285
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,840
which he kept in the trunk.

286
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,080
LEE: He told me to turn on
my air vents on high

287
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,600
and roll up my windows
and get out of the car

288
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,920
because he was going to run
a canine around it.

289
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,760
MALE REPORTER: Dove didn't find
drugs, but he did find

290
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,360
the $2,400.

291
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,520
He said, "No, I'm going to
keep the money because

292
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,520
"I've concluded through
my investigation here

293
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,640
"that you are traveling
from Michigan to California

294
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,080
to purchase drugs."

295
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,320
Wow. There is so much wrong
there, including the fact that

296
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,520
any policeman who
genuinely believes

297
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,440
you need to travel from
Michigan to California

298
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,920
to purchase drugs

299
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,800
needs to be introduced
to the concept of

300
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,840
the University of Wisconsin,
Madison.

301
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,440
OK? It's right there.

302
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,960
And the problem is, stories like
that are surprisingly common.

303
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,920
In fact, since 9/11,
under just one program,

304
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,080
police have taken $2.5 billion

305
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,440
in the course of over 61,000
seizures of cash alone

306
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,120
from people who--and this
is the mind-blowing part--

307
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,800
were not charged with a crime.

308
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,800
That is the sort of
police behavior

309
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,080
that we laugh at
other countries for,

310
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,080
along with their accents
and silly hats.

311
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,720
The way civil forfeiture
generally works is that

312
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,480
if the police believe they have
a preponderance of the evidence

313
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,920
that suggests your property was
or could be used in a crime,

314
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,280
they may confiscate it,
and it gets even weirder.

315
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,440
Many folks are unfamiliar with
the idea of civil forfeiture,

316
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,840
which is actually
a case brought against,

317
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,320
directly against
a piece a property,

318
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,400
where you don't need to be
proven guilty of a crime

319
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,960
for your goods to be taken away.

320
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,240
Exactly. You don't need
to be charged with a crime,

321
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,880
because it's not you that's
on trial, it's your stuff.

322
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,880
That's why these cases
have historically

323
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,520
had eye-catching names such as--
and all of these are real--

324
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,120
United States vs.
$8,850 in U.S. Currency,

325
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,800
United States vs.
An Article Consisting of

326
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,920
50,000 Cardboard Boxes
More or Less,

327
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,320
Each Containing One Pair
of Clacker Balls,

328
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,000
and United States
vs. Approximately

329
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,960
64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins,

330
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,720
which must've been
an amazing court case.

331
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,680
And do you see those shark fins
in the room right now?

332
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,520
Yes! There they are!
There they are!

333
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,760
Let the record show
the witness has pointed

334
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,960
at roughly 65,000 pounds
of shark fins.

335
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,040
Guilty, guilty.

336
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,920
And it's also worth noting

337
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,800
that your possessions generally
have fewer protections

338
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,080
under the law than you do.

339
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,000
Under civil forfeiture laws,

340
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,920
your property is guilty
until you prove it innocent.

341
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,040
How can that be possible?
At this point, I'm surprised

342
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,920
objects don't have their own
civil rights leader,

343
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,280
like Martin Scooter King
or Harvey Carton of Milk.

344
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,080
Now, to be fair,

345
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,640
civil forfeiture laws have had
some positive consequences.

346
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,320
They've crippled powerful
drug-trafficking organizations,

347
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,840
thwarted criminals, and returned
billions of dollars to victims.

348
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,840
The problem is that
many police departments

349
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,320
are allowed to keep most or all
of the money they seize.

350
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,200
And knowing that starts
to make you wonder

351
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,160
about the motivations of
these kinds of questions.

352
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,080
I'll take whatever
cash you got in there

353
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,400
and is that a Slurpee
in the cup holder?

354
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,760
What flavor?
Grape? Never mind.

355
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Do you know what?
I will take it.

356
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,680
I'll take it.

357
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,000
The question "Do you have
cash in the vehicle?"

358
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,800
is surprisingly common
in traffic stops.

359
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,840
And the police are
prepared to overcome

360
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,280
any language barrier to ask it.

361
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,680
Tenny mucho mucho deniro
in su trucky trailer?

362
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,360
Let's be clear.

363
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:40,480
He just said, "Tenny mucho mucho
deniro in su trucky trailer,"

364
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,200
which sounds like an alien's
first attempt to communicate

365
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,440
with humans after crash-landing
in a Taco Bell.

366
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,920
In fact, let's all just
pause for a moment

367
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,840
to enjoy that sentence

368
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,880
because every single
word of it is funny.

369
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,880
First, "tenny,"
pronounced incorrectly.

370
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,120
"Mucho," one of the few words
he knows in Spanish.

371
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,240
"Mucho," repeated word.

372
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,880
"Deniro," a famed actor.

373
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,920
"In," a rapid shift to English.

374
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,800
"Su," rapid shift
back to Spanish.

375
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,920
"Trucky trailer"--
trucky trailer.

376
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,640
Now, it's magnificent.
That is magnificent.

377
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,360
It's a work of art.
Now, this happened in Tennessee,

378
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,080
a state where local
law enforcement authorities

379
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,800
are allowed to keep
as much as 100%

380
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,600
of the proceeds from
civil forfeitures.

381
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,360
A local news investigation found
multiple troubling cases of

382
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,240
people having money seized,
such as George Reby,

383
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,800
who had $20,000 seized after
he was stopped for speeding.

384
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,880
The police officer
argued it was drug money,

385
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,560
despite the fact that Reby
had a pretty good explanation.

386
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,880
REBY: I told him I had
active bids on eBay,

387
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,160
that I was trying
to buy a vehicle,

388
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,920
and they just
didn't want to hear it.

389
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,080
MALE REPORTER: In fact,
Reby had proof on his computer,

390
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,040
but the Monterey officer
drew up a damning affidavit,

391
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,720
citing his own training that "common people

392
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,560
do not carry this much
U.S. currency."

393
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,080
And did he tell you that he was trying
to buy a car?

394
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,800
He did.

395
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,840
But you did not include
that in your report.

396
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,560
If it's not in there,
I didn't put it in there.

397
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,200
So, why would you
leave that out?

398
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I don't know.

399
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,040
What do you mean
you don't know?

400
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,440
I expect a better answer
from a police officer

401
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,920
than a 4-year-old
who just spilled

402
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,600
grape juice on the couch.

403
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,320
What happened to your drink?

404
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,440
I don't know.
I don't know.

405
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,520
If it's not in my glass,
it's not in my glass.

406
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,400
I don't know.
I don't know.

407
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,000
And look, it's not always
just a roadside stop.

408
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,000
In 2008, police raided

409
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,280
the Contemporary Art Institute
of Detroit

410
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,080
during its Funk Night because
it didn't have a liquor license,

411
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,200
seizing 44 cars,
under the argument that

412
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,480
"simply driving vehicles
to the location

413
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,480
of an unlawful sale of alcohol
was sufficient to seize a car."

414
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,240
Which means you may as well
seize any car

415
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,880
driven by any teenager
on prom night,

416
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,800
because they are all
going to Chad's place.

417
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,840
Chad's got the hookup.

418
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,680
We actually managed
to get the security video

419
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,800
of that Detroit raid,

420
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,880
and you can see
the police burst in

421
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,600
and arrest people with
the disco lights still twirling

422
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,240
in the single funkiest
shakedown in human history.

423
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,760
They each had to pay $900 to get
their cars out of the impound,

424
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,720
with the exception
of the one person

425
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,000
whose car was actually
stolen from the lot

426
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,960
to which it had been towed,

427
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,280
which seems like
the sort of thing

428
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,960
the police should be
investigating, if they weren't

429
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,640
too busy raiding
art gallery funk nights.

430
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,680
And at this point, you may be
thinking, well, sure,

431
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,360
the police departments
are getting

432
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,800
a lot of money
from seizing stuff,

433
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,120
but I'm sure
there are limitations

434
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,800
on how they can spend it.

435
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,840
Well, allow me to take you
to a 2012 Columbia, Missouri,

436
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,480
citizen police
review board hearing.

437
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,680
How do you decide
forfeiture funds?

438
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,560
You know, it's usually
based on a need.

439
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,800
Well, I take that back.

440
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,960
Discretion I'd
imagine you sign off on.

441
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,920
Yeah. There's some
limitations on it.

442
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,400
You know, it's--actually,

443
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,960
there's not really
on the forfeiture stuff.

444
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,000
Actually, there's basically
no limitations at all,

445
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,520
come to think of it.

446
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,840
We're essentially gods.
We're gods.

447
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,080
We're like the anti-Spiderman--
great power, no responsibility.

448
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,840
I can't believe this
hasn't come up before.

449
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,240
And look, his honesty
was not over.

450
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,720
It's--we just usually
base it on something that

451
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,080
would be nice to have,

452
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,920
that we can't get in the budget,
for instance.

453
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,280
We try not to use it for things
that we need to depend on

454
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,400
because we need to go ahead
and have those purchased.

455
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
But it's kind of like
pennies from heaven, you know.

456
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,120
It gets you a toy or something
that you need,

457
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,600
is the way we
typically look at it.

458
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,160
That's right.
That's right.

459
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,160
They buy toys
with pennies from heaven.

460
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,000
Although you should know,
those pennies may not be

461
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,920
falling from heaven, so much as
from the pockets of the people

462
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,880
they're holding
upside down and shaking.

463
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,520
And in terms of what kind of
toys police departments buy,

464
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,880
that really depends.

465
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,280
For instance, in Massachusetts,

466
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,520
one D.A.'s office used
forfeiture money

467
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,240
to buy their own Zamboni,

468
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,120
even though auditors noted,
"We could not determine

469
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,160
"where this machine was located

470
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,000
or the law enforcement
purpose it serves."

471
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,560
Although that last one
is obvious.

472
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,120
Just think about it.
If you are robbing a bank,

473
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,960
and the police pull up
in a Zamboni,

474
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,120
you're gonna
give yourself up

475
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,360
just out of sheer curiosity.

476
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,440
And in Texas, in Texas,
one D.A.'s office

477
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,800
had an even more
imaginative idea.

478
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,360
And I'll let a concerned
citizen at a public hearing

479
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,880
tell you all about it.

480
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,720
That's true.
In Texas,

481
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,480
they bought
a margarita machine.

482
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,560
They were literally
using this money

483
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,840
as their own personal
slush fund.

484
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,400
They were literal--
it's perfect.

485
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,920
The analogy is perfect.

486
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,840
And, look, look, if the police
need money for equipment,

487
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,440
we should clearly be
giving it to them.

488
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,840
And if they need money
for margarita machines,

489
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,320
they should be fucking
paying for that themselves.

490
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,360
But these civil forfeiture laws

491
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,760
have warped law enforcement
priorities and perception.

492
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,320
And nowhere is that
more clear than Philadelphia.

493
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,320
FEMALE REPORTER: Philadelphia
officials over a 10-year period

494
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,680
have seized more than 1,000
houses, about 3,300 vehicles,

495
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,680
and $44 million in cash
in civil forfeitures.

496
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,680
Holy shit.

497
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,600
Usually when someone describes
something taking

498
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,960
3,000 vehicles
and 1,000 houses,

499
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,920
they're talking about
a fucking hurricane.

500
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,960
One of those houses belonged
to the Sourovelis family,

501
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,000
and the reason for that seizure

502
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,720
seems a little harsh
from the outside.

503
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,640
FEMALE REPORTER: Police arrested
their 22-year-old son Yanni

504
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,560
on drug charges,
$40 worth of heroin,

505
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,120
and claim he was selling drugs
out of the home.

506
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,800
Police and prosecutors
came armed with a lawsuit

507
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,880
against the house itself.

508
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,880
Exactly, because remember,
the parents aren't on trial,

509
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,240
the house is,
which is clearly ridiculous.

510
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,440
The only drug-containing house
that needs a lawsuit against it

511
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,720
is this one.

512
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,960
You're on the edge.
You're on the edge, House!

513
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
You're this close!

514
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,920
You're this close
to losing your job!

515
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,760
You're good, damn it.
You're good, House!

516
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,360
You're close, House, you're
close, but you're good.

517
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,440
But you're so close!

518
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,440
But you're so good, House.

519
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,800
And once their house
was seized,

520
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,400
the Sourovelises
got to experience

521
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,760
the final problem
with civil forfeiture.

522
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,360
Recourse can be
incredibly difficult.

523
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,040
FEMALE REPORTER:
Here in Philadelphia,

524
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,920
if you have your property taken,

525
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,680
you can come here to city hall

526
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,240
and go to courtroom 478
and try to get it back.

527
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,040
Problem is, the people that are
taking the belongings are also

528
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,880
the ones calling the shots
inside the courtroom.

529
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,840
The Sourovelises showed up
to courtroom 478

530
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,160
ready to plead their case
to a judge.

531
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,600
Instead, they say, they faced

532
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,680
a prosecutor from
the D.A.'s office.

533
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,200
That's right.
Their first step in challenging

534
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,920
the police seizing their
property was in a courtroom

535
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,160
without a judge
hearing their case.

536
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,320
How can you even still
call that a courtroom?

537
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,480
If you take all the doctors
out of a hospital

538
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,960
and replace them with otters,
that's no longer a hospital.

539
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,080
It's better, it's much better,
but it's not a hospital.

540
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,120
I don't know what--I love it,
but it's not a hospital.

541
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,880
In fact, recourse
is so difficult

542
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,440
that most people who've lost
stuff to civil forfeiture

543
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,840
just choose to walk away
rather than fight.

544
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,000
So at this point,
it should seem obvious

545
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,400
that the bad may be
starting to outweigh the good

546
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,960
with civil forfeiture laws.

547
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,600
So we've really got
two choices.

548
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
We can take a hard look
at reforming them

549
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,680
or, at the very least,
we need to reform

550
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,520
our network cop dramas to make
them a lot more representative

551
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
of what is actually happening.

552
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,360
ANNOUNCER: Coming soon...

553
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,480
Get ready to go inside

554
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,560
the thrilling world
of civil forfeiture.

555
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,200
Knock, knock.
Freeze. Police.

556
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,000
Hands on the ground.
Get off the sofa.

557
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,720
WOMAN: Keep them where
we can see them.

558
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,800
You're under arrest.

559
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,800
What for? You guys
got nothing on me.

560
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,240
Not you.
Cell phone.

561
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,560
ANNOUNCER: Coming this fall--
a procedural about

562
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,000
law enforcement's
shadiest procedure.

563
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,760
Rough night, huh?

564
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,480
Well, it's about
to get a lot rougher.

565
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,320
What's 2,500 in cash

566
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,240
doing hanging out
in somebody's glove box? Huh?

567
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,520
Answer me.

568
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,920
ANNOUNCER: These cops are
determined, and they won't stop

569
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,880
until they get everything,
every last thing.

570
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,280
You're dirty, right?
Drug deal, guns, what is it?

571
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,080
I can't help you if
you don't talk to me!

572
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,560
I'm going to beat
the shit out you.

573
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,640
Detective Forfacci,
Civil Forfeiture Unit.

574
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,640
ANNOUNCER: Brace yourself for
heart-pounding takedowns.

575
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,200
Resisting arrest.
Send in backup.

576
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,520
Send in backup.

577
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,760
ANNOUNCE: The defendants
are inanimate,

578
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,120
but the drama is anything but.

579
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
Frisk him.

580
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,240
There's a pile of
silver dollars next door

581
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,640
that says you did it.

582
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,000
You will lose
and I will win.

583
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,600
Stay on the streets too long,

584
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,320
the city leaves a bad
taste in your mouth.

585
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,400
Hey, I know
what'll get it out.

586
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,040
I'm gonna crumple you up

587
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,160
till you look like
a cat's asshole.

588
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,880
That's our show!
We'll be back in two weeks!

589
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,880
Thank you so much for watching.
Good night.

590
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,800
This is nothing more than a,

591
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,960
it's kind of a tap dance.

592
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,000
Speaking of which, here.

593
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Yeah?

594
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,000
Do you want anything
from the vending machine?

595
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,920
You think I care about you?

596
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,160
If it were up to me,

597
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,880
I'd take a wad of gum,

598
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,880
stick it right on Andrew
Jackson's smug fucking face,

599
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,960
crumple you up, stuff you
in a pair of old Dockers,

600
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,840
throw you in a washing machine
on permanent press,

601
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,880
then hand you off to a toddler

602
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,320
with a pair of scissors
and a marker

603
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,400
and tell him to make confetti.

604
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,640
Well, looks like I'm the one

605
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,400
that tennys mucho, mucho deniro
in my trucky trailer.
