00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,000
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,280
EPISODE 5

3
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,600
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,680
Thank you for being with us.
Quick recap of this week.

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,760
It began with Europe reeling

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,280
from the results of the
European Parliamentary elections.

7
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,600
A political earthquake. That's how,
at least one European law maker

8
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,240
described the unprecedented surge
of far right and anti-EU parties

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,400
that swept to power
this weekend.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,120
There was a surge
of far-right parties in Europe ?

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,120
In terms of
"phrases you don't want to hear",

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,520
that is up there with "it's malignant"
and "we're losing cabin pressure".

13
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,560
Because lest we forget,
when Europe goes far right,

14
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,960
they go far right
through Belgium.

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,600
And in case you think
I might be exaggerating,

16
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,480
take a look at Greece's
"golden dawn" party.

17
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,440
The party campaigns
with the slogan "Clear the Filth".

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,760
The filth, its code
for African and Asian migrants.

19
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,840
We may do the Hitler salute,
but our hands are clean.

20
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,120
Wait !

21
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,320
Your hand cleanliness
is not people's chief concern.

22
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,360
If you're gonna start a sentence with
"we may do the Hitler salute but ",

23
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,240
you have to end it
with something better than that.

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,960
"We may do the Hitler salute,
but only to show how tall a llama is".

25
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,000
It's about this tall.
From my chest, just about there.

26
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,040
These guys have seats
in the European Parliament now.

27
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,720
This is one of their flags.
That's basically a jaunty swastika.

28
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,440
If Hitler was alive he'd sue them
for trademark infringement.

29
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,720
And he was a real Nazi
about intellectual property.

30
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,600
The worst thing is, these guys won't
be lonely in the European Parliament.

31
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,560
They'll be joining
Hungary's Jobbik party.

32
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's check in
on one of their rallies.

33
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,240
The May Day festival
for supporters of Jobbik,

34
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,000
Hungary's ultra far-right
political party.

35
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,000
Just three years ago,
it exploded onto the political scene

36
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,440
on an anti-semitic,
anti-roma, gypsey ticket.

37
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,560
Okay, couple things.
A, that's terrifying.

38
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,040
B, quick sidenote:
why do neo-nazis always like metal ?

39
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,960
Is there anyone in to anti-zionist
conspiracy theories "and" smooth jazz ?

40
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,160
Hey there, we are groove step.

41
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,000
We're here to denounce the
mongrel races, but first: let's jam.

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,800
This is a little quiet storm
off our new album: pure bloodlines.

43
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,160
Give it up for Neil Whiteman on drums.
Real name. Can't make it up.

44
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,360
In less alarming news,
Ukraine chose a new leader

45
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,960
with million of voters
heading out to the ballot boxes.

46
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,760
Before you judge, you don't know
the context of that clip.

47
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,320
Maybe they were just overexcited
or thought it was an electoral pinata.

48
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,760
Of the votes that weren't destroyed,
who emerged victorious ?

49
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,160
Ukrainians elected Petro Poroshenko
as their next president.

50
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,880
He's a pro-European billionaire.
Who has been nicknamed

51
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,920
The Chocolate King
because of his candy business.

52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,440
That's right, they've elected
the owner of a chocolate factory.

53
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,280
Ukraine is now in the hands
of the Willy Wonka of eastern Europe !

54
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,920
Come with me and you'll be
in a world of pure annihilation !

55
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,920
Congratulations Ukraine,

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,280
you may have gone from least whimsical
to most whimsical country on earth.

57
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,320
It was a big week for Afghanistan.
The American soldier whose been

58
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,160
in the hands of the Taliban for nearly
five years now is coming home.

59
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,640
And what of all the other
us troops still there ?

60
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,480
Over the last couple years

61
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,560
the president has held firm
with his planned deadline.

62
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,040
By 2014, this process of transition
will be complete,

63
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,520
and the Afghan people will be
responsible for their own security.

64
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,440
By the end of 2014

65
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,760
the Afghans will be fully responsible
for the security of their country.

66
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,920
We will have them
all out of there by 2014.

67
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,800
And this week he announced a plan to
almost completely stick to that plan,

68
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,040
for all but just under
ten thousand troops.

69
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,920
President Obama has a new plan
to end America's military involvement.

70
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,320
His plan calls for 9,800 troops to stay
in Afghanistan after this year ends

71
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,320
and then about half
of that by the end of 2015.

72
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,120
By December 2015,
just under five thousand troops.

73
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,080
The plan actually goes beyond that.
By December 2016, it says we'll have,

74
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,040
a thousand troops, tops,
but basically we're out.

75
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,320
Not like out-out,
but you know, pretty much out.

76
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,520
And finally, by March 2017,

77
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,800
300 uniforms on mannequins
but no actual troops

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,520
except for five troops,

79
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,880
and 7,000 heavily-armed
Americans on tourist visas.

80
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,000
Essentially, after twelve
and a half years over there,

81
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,920
it might be fairer to say that
America's current official policy is:

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,680
"we are about to leave Afghanistan,
and we always will be."

83
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,120
And now, this !

84
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,680
And now, after resigning,

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,960
Jay Carney tells one last pack of lies
to the White House Press Room.

86
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,600
It's been an amazing experience,
just so fulfilling.

87
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,440
I've answered several times,
but I'm happy to answer it again.

88
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,560
C'mon, Ed. John, I get it !

89
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,640
Ed ! Again, go look at the facts.
John, can I finish ?

90
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,160
Everyday in here,
with you, has been a privilege.

91
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,080
Okay, hold on, John !

92
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,000
Guys !

93
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,400
It's an important interaction
that takes place here.

94
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,240
The president did not communicate
with Jay-Z.

95
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,280
I decided the time had come
to shave, so...

96
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,880
And no matter
how tough the briefing is,

97
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,400
I walk out of here
having been glad to stand here.

98
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,640
I gotta run.

99
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,920
I give up.

100
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,000
I think we're done here, thanks.

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,240
Moving on.

102
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,040
Our top story tonight
concerns the internet.

103
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,680
Aka, the electronic
cat database.

104
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,200
But first,
let's take just moment together

105
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,880
and appreciate
how amazing the internet is.

106
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,200
You can use it to file your taxes...
Apply for jobs...

107
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,880
You can go online right now
and buy a case of coyote urine.

108
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,280
Do you know how difficult it
used to be to obtain coyote urine ?

109
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,800
You literally have to give
a coyote Gatorade and just wait !

110
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,160
It was a mess !
The system was a mess.

111
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,800
But if you've turned
on the news lately,

112
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,440
you may've heard some worrying
references to the internet changing.

113
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,880
Federal communications commission
agreed to move forward on a proposal.

114
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,280
It could change
the way we use the internet,

115
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,120
at risk the basic principal
of net neutrality.

116
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,200
Net neutrality.

117
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,560
Yes, net neutrality.
The only two words

118
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,240
that promise more boredom in the
English language are "featuring Sting".

119
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,520
And hearing people talk about it
is somehow even worse.

120
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,000
As anticipated the notice proposed
to ground the net neutrality rules

121
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,520
in section 706
of the telecommunications act of 1996.

122
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,920
My God, that is the most boring
thing I have ever seen !

123
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,440
That's even boring
by C-Span standards !

124
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,680
I would rather read
a book by Thomas Friedman

125
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,480
than sit through that hearing !

126
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,120
I would rather
listen to a pair of Dockers

127
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,440
tell me
about the weird dream it had.

128
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,840
I would rather sit down with my niece
and watch Caillou

129
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,400
a children's show
about a bald Canadian child

130
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,160
who lives a life
devoid of any incident.

131
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,120
Fuck you, Caillou !
Grow some hair and leave the house !

132
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,480
Find out what the worlds about !

133
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,040
But here's the thing. Net neutrality
is actually hugely important.

134
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Essentially, it means that all data

135
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,480
has to be treated equally,
no matter who creates it.

136
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,920
It's why the internet
is a weirdly level playing field

137
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,960
and startups
can supplant established brands.

138
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,400
That's how Facebook
supplanted Myspace,

139
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,240
which supplanted Friendster,

140
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,040
which supplanted
actually having any friends.

141
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,240
Do you remember
physically having that ? It was awful.

142
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,400
You couldn't tap people's faces
to make them go away.

143
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,320
The point is, the internet
in its current form is not broken.

144
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,440
And the FCC is currently
taking steps to fix that.

145
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,840
FCC is endorsing new rules that could
clear the way for a two-tier system.

146
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,680
The rules would open
the door for the first time

147
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,640
for internet providers
like Comcast and Verizon

148
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,640
to charge tech companies to send
content to consumers more quickly.

149
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,560
Netflix, for example,
might pay a premium

150
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,200
to ensure that its customers
can stream movies more reliably,

151
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,760
at a cost a start-up competitor
might not be able to afford.

152
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,880
No, this cannot happen !

153
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,440
How else is my startup streaming video
service, Nutflix, going to compete ?

154
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,840
It's going to be
America's one-stop resource

155
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,240
for videos of men
getting hit in the nuts !

156
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,800
You don't even know you want it yet.
That's why it's brilliant.

157
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,400
Ending net neutrality
would allow big companies

158
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,760
to buy their way into the fast lane,
leaving everyone else in the slow lane.

159
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,640
Telecom companies would prefer
that you put it a slightly different way.

160
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,960
When you say fast lane and slow lane,
it's a good illustration,

161
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,200
but what you really
should talk about

162
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,680
is a fast lane for everybody
and a hyper speed lane for others.

163
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
Bull. Shit.

164
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,240
If we let cable companies
offer two speeds of service,

165
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,920
they won't be Usain Bolt,
and Usain Bolt on a motorbike.

166
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,480
They'll be Usain Bolt
and Usain "bolted" to an anchor.

167
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,400
And telecom companies will say
they would never slow down

168
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,520
a website's speed in order
to get more money out of them.

169
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,440
But let me tell you a little story.
Comcast was negotiating with Netflix.

170
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,440
This graph shows Netflix
download speeds on various providers.

171
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,880
That black line
plummeting downwards

172
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,920
was their speed on Comcast
during the negotiation.

173
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,960
See if you can guess when Netflix
agreed to Comcast's demands.

174
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,520
I'll give you a hint:
it's right there.

175
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,040
That has all the ingredients
of a mob shakedown !

176
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,080
Netflix, nice show
about life in a ladies' prison.

177
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,200
Such a shame if something were
to happen to your connection there.

178
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,000
So frustrating that would be.

179
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,360
And it's not
just anti-corporate hippies

180
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,720
who think that abandoning
net neutrality is a bad idea.

181
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,480
Net neutrality movement
is leery of big corporate players

182
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,640
but in this debate,
it's on the same side as some of them.

183
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,600
Google, Facebook,
Netflix, Amazon

184
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,320
all signed on to this letter
supporting net neutrality.

185
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,840
What's being proposed
is so egregious,

186
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,760
activists and corporations have been
forced onto the same side.

187
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,080
That's basically Lex Luthor knocking
on superman's apartment door

188
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,960
and going:
"I know we have our differences,"

189
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,640
"but we have got to get rid
of that asshole in apartment 3-B."

190
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,880
"He's loud Sup,
he's just too loud."

191
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,000
And you might wonder,
well look if everyone's against this,

192
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,120
how is this even
possibly happening ?

193
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,200
Consider who would benefit
from this change. Cable companies.

194
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,320
Verizon wants
a two-tier system so badly,

195
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,640
they sued the government to force
the rule change that's being discussed.

196
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,640
These companies
have Washington in their pockets

197
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,560
to a conveniently
almost unbelievable degree.

198
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,440
Comcast has spent $18,810,000 million
in lobbying last year.

199
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,760
That's more than
any other company

200
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,640
except for Northrop Grumman.

201
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,080
To be clear, the ranking of
"who buys government influence" is...

202
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,960
Number one:
"military industrial complex."

203
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,160
And number two:
"provider of Lizard-lick towing.

204
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,480
I could show you
the troublingly cozy relationship

205
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,000
between cable companies
and Washington in any number of ways.

206
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,520
I could show you the president
golfing with the CEO of Comcast.

207
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,560
Or saying at a fundraiser
at a cable executive's house

208
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,600
that he'd been there
so many times,

209
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,360
"the only thing I haven't done
in this house is have Seder dinner."

210
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,000
But perhaps
the most succinct way is this...

211
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,400
The president
has picked Tom Wheeler

212
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,280
to be the next chair of the federal
communications commission.

213
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,920
Yes. The guy who used to run
the cable industry's lobbying arm

214
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,320
is now running the agency
tasked with regulating it.

215
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,800
That is the equivalent of needing
a babysitter and hiring a dingo.

216
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,280
"Here, thanks for stopping over.

217
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,520
Make sure they're in bed by 8, there's
20 bucks on the table for kibble.

218
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,200
So please don't eat my baby."

219
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:16,560
With the fact that they're practically
overseeing their own oversight,

220
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,800
it's hardly surprising cable companies
are basically monopolies now.

221
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,600
A federal study found
that 96 percent of the population

222
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,760
had access to two or fewer
cable broadband providers.

223
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,520
It's almost as if they've agreed
to stay out of each other's way.

224
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,760
Like drug cartels.

225
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,080
But hold on,
that's not fair.

226
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,760
If hypothetically a cable
company like Comcast

227
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,480
were planning to merge with
a company like Time Warner

228
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,640
it's not like their CEO would sit down
and mark out who had which turf.

229
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,040
Both in video and in broadband
we don't compete with Time Warner.

230
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,720
They're in New York.
We're in Philadelphia.

231
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,120
They're in L.A.,
we're in San Francisco.

232
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,280
You can't buy a Comcast in New York
or a Time Warner in Philadelphia.

233
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,480
There's no reduction in competition.

234
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,560
You can't reduce competition
when nobody is competing.

235
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,040
You could not be describing
a monopoly more clearly

236
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,240
if you were wearing a metal top hat
while driving a metal car,

237
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,400
after winning second prize
in a beauty contest.

238
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,840
And maybe it's because
of their lack of competition

239
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,960
that they get away
with providing such shitty service.

240
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,680
We pay more for our internet service
than almost anybody else on earth,

241
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,080
and yet the download speeds
we get lag behind Estonia.

242
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,040
A country where, from the looks of it,
they still worry about Shrek attacks.

243
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,600
Is it any wonder that, in a massive
recent customer satisfaction surveys,

244
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,520
Comcast and Time Warner Cable
came in dead last.

245
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,840
And when you look at the companies
that were scored better than them,

246
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,480
people were basically saying, yes,
Bank of America took my home.

247
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,000
Yes, Taco bell gave me diarrhea.
And sure, GM tried to kill me.

248
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:19,280
But Time Warner and Comcast
are "the worst". They are the worst.

249
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,320
I know the cable companies
will say:

250
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,960
"They support
"net neutrality protection"

251
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,320
or they remain
"committed to the open internet",

252
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,040
or "just the tip."

253
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,040
But let me remind you:

254
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,840
they also say they'll be at your house
between 2 and 6 tomorrow afternoon,

255
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,560
and does any part of you really
expect them to fucking turn up ?

256
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,960
And yet our government
looks set to end net neutrality

257
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,960
and let these companies run hog wild,
and we're just going to let them.

258
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,440
And you know why ?
It all comes back to this:

259
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,040
It seeks comment on ways to construe
additional language in section 706

260
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,320
and even suggest
using 230B to broaden

261
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,240
the scope of the commissions
usurped authority.

262
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,840
God, how are you still so dull !
And that's the problem:

263
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,520
The cable companies have figured out
the great truth of America:

264
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,160
If you want to do something evil,
put it inside something boring.

265
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,560
Apple could put "Mein Kampf"
inside the ITunes user agreement,

266
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,480
and you would click
"agree," "agree," "agree."

267
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,400
That's why advocates

268
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,000
shouldn't talk
about protecting net neutrality.

269
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,160
They shouldn't even use
that phrase.

270
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,360
They should call it:
preventing cable company fuckery.

271
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,520
Because that is what it is.

272
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,840
And it might actually compel people
to want to do something.

273
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:57,040
The interesting thing here is, there
might be something you can still do.

274
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,520
The FCC will be taking
public comment for 120 days.

275
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,080
That's right: the FCC are literally
"inviting" internet comments

276
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,360
at "this" address.

277
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,120
And at this point, and I can't
believe I'm about to do this,

278
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,400
I would like to address the internet
commenters out there directly.

279
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,320
Good evening, monsters.

280
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,280
This may be the moment you've spent
your whole lives training for.

281
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,000
You have been out there
ferociously commenting

282
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,840
on dance videos of adorable
three-year-olds, saying things like,

283
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,080
"every child could dance like this
little loser after 1 week of practice."

284
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,880
Or you've been polluting Frozen's
"Let It Go" with comments like

285
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,480
"Ice castle would give her hypothermia
and she dead in an hour."

286
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,160
Or, and I know you've done this one,
commenting on a video of this show,

287
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,960
"fuck this asshole anchor...
go suck ur president's dick...

288
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,960
ur friends with the terrorists."

289
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,640
Now, I don't know
what any of that means,

290
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,560
but I don't think its a compliment.

291
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,680
But this is the moment
you were made for, commenters.

292
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,480
Like Ralph Macchio,
you've been honing your skills,

293
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,440
waxing cars and painting fences.

294
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,040
Guess what ? Now it's time
to do some fucking karate.

295
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,680
For once in your life,
we need you to channel that anger,

296
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,120
that badly-spelled bile,

297
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,560
that you normally reserve
for unforgivable attacks

298
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,480
on actresses you seem
to think have put on weight,

299
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,200
or politicians you disagree with.

300
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,920
Or photos of your ex-girlfriend
getting on with her life,

301
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,240
or non-white actors being
cast as fictional characters !

302
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,120
I'm talking to you,
"Ron Paul fan 2016" !

303
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,280
And you,
"One Direction 4ever" !

304
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,920
And you,
"One Direction sux balls !"

305
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,960
We need you to get out there
and, for once in your lives,

306
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,960
focus your indiscriminate rage
in a useful direction !

307
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,160
Seize your moment,
my lovely trolls !

308
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,360
Turn on caps lock
and fly my pretties !

309
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,880
Fly !

310
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,560
And now this !

311
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,520
Fly !

312
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,840
America. Everyone knows
it's the greatest nation on earth.

313
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,720
And our leaders
are the greatest leaders on earth.

314
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,320
But did you know there are other
countries that are not America ?

315
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,800
And each of them
has a leader of its very own ?

316
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,880
Let's take a moment to meet one,
in our ongoing series,

317
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,960
"Other Countries' Presidents
of the United States !"

318
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,600
This week's leader: Tony Abbott,
prime minister of Australia,

319
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,240
the island nation famed
for its bouncing kangaroos

320
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,880
and bloomin' onions.

321
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,480
Its current leader: Hard-line
right-wing prime minister Tony Abbott,

322
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,120
who rose to power promising
to be pro-business

323
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,240
and religiously anti-immigration.

324
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,400
Literally, religiously
anti-immigration.

325
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,720
And Jesus knew that there was
a place for everything,

326
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,600
and is not necessarily everyone's
place to come to Australia.

327
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,440
Exactly ! Australia is for real
Australians, like Tony Abbott.

328
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,760
Who was born
in London, England.

329
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,240
It's that kind
of rhetorical consistency

330
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,320
that's won him the admiration
of his predecessors...

331
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,560
If Tony Abbott ends up
the prime minister of Australia,

332
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,440
You gotta say,
'god help us.' god help us ?

333
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,000
Tributes in song...

334
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,080
Fuck you Abbott,
fuck, fuck you Abbott.

335
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,440
And the love of Australia's children.

336
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,840
My mummy calls him
Tony Dumb-Dumb

337
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,480
because she thinks
he's so, like, dumb.

338
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,680
What is it about Tony Dumb-Dumb

339
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,960
that's led to his current
approval rating of 30 percent ?

340
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,280
Could it be that he's insulted
everyone else in the country ?

341
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,440
From women...

342
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,360
The housewives of Australia need to
understand is that they do the ironing.

343
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
To gays.

344
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,080
Homosexuality:
How do you feel about that ?

345
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,280
I'd probably feel a bit threatened !

346
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,680
To anyone remotely Irish...

347
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,120
This government's
a bit like the Irishman

348
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,880
who lost 10 pounds
betting on the Grand National

349
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,400
and then lost 20 pounds
on the action replay.

350
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,320
To elderly, cancer-ridden
phone sex workers...

351
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,040
Tony Abbott has been filmed
winking during a radio show.

352
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,160
I'm a 69 year old pensioner, three
chronic incurable medical conditions,

353
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,760
two life threatening and I work on
an adult sex line to make ends meet.

354
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,840
To incredibly this...

355
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,160
Tony Abbott has been called out

356
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,160
seemingly insulting a Queensland
soldier killed in Afghanistan.

357
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,320
After being told about
the complications with the firefight,

358
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,320
this is Mr. Abbott's reaction.

359
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:54,600
It's pretty obvious that...
Sometimes shit happens, doesn't it ?

360
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,120
Sometimes shit "does" happen.

361
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,960
Luckily, Tony Abbott
is a master of words,

362
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,480
and can talk
himself out of any situation.

363
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,400
Look, a soldier has died,

364
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,040
and you shouldn't be trying to turn
this into a subsequent media circus.

365
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,000
How's that turning it
into a media circus ?

366
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,640
Tell me, what's the context ? If it's
out of context, what is the context ?

367
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,240
You're not saying anything, Tony.

368
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,920
You deserve this response.

369
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,960
Yes, Tony Abbott knows:

370
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,240
one panicked, pants-shitting expression
is worth a thousand words.

371
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,080
And what a way with words
Tony Abbott has.

372
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,200
No one-however smart,

373
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,960
however well educated
however experienced

374
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,360
is the suppository of all wisdom.

375
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,760
But if anyone is the suppository
of wisdom, surely, it's Tony Abbott.

376
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,080
A man who always knows
exactly what to say, or not to say

377
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,240
and who's won exactly as much respect
from his constituents as he deserves.

378
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,080
- Good Morning Sir, how are you, sir ?
- Dickhead.

379
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,080
Finally tonight.

380
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,000
Finally: there were
a lot of competitions this week.

381
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,360
But if you were watching
the NBA or the Stanley Cup playoffs,

382
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,640
you might've missed the most
entertaining contest of all:

383
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,720
Tonight we go from 12 to 1

384
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,240
as we crown the 2014 Scripps
National Spelling Bee Champion.

385
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,560
The National Spelling Bee.
The Hunger Games of the mind.

386
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,680
It was filled with inspiring moments,
and not just from the winners,

387
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,320
but the fact that the losers
all went out with incredible poise.

388
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,560
Just look at this girl,
graciously waving like royalty,

389
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,480
and shaking the hands
of all her competitors,

390
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,880
before giving the greatest
post-defeat interview ever.

391
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,600
What's next for you as you take
on the next chapter ?

392
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,000
I'm going to go home,
take 24 hours,

393
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
and watch every horror movie
on which I can get my hands.

394
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,920
I love this girl.
"On which I can get my hands."

395
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,920
Even in her darkest moment,

396
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,800
she cannot bring herself
to end a sentence with a preposition.

397
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,000
I would love to see an athlete lose
with that kind of grace.

398
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,840
Have a quarterback
walk off the field saying,

399
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,440
"well, yes, they beat me,
but in the next game,

400
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,480
out is the direction in which
they should be watching.

401
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,280
I bid you good day.
I bid you good day, gentlemen."

402
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,560
Inevitably, most of the children
ended up making mistakes.

403
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,320
Although to their credit,

404
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,360
none made as big a mistake
as one of the officials did.

405
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,040
May I have the sentence please ?

406
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,360
Tabitha discovered

407
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,640
that while her milkshake
brought all the boys to the yard...

408
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,720
I'm sorry,
I was reading the wrong sentence.

409
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,000
"Sorry, the correct sentence is:

410
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,640
"Kurt enjoyed a dish
of vijayawada and bitter greens,

411
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,400
hard like a rock,
when you make that pussy pop.

412
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,520
Pop that pussy.

413
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,200
But the kids persevered through
that inexplicable moment,

414
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,040
leading to an uplifting
historic finish.

415
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,640
13-year-old Ansun Sujoe
and 14-year-old Sriram Hathwar

416
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,960
claimed a rare dual victory
at the nation's largest spelling bee.

417
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,600
The face-off ended in a tie,
after judges exhausted the word list.

418
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,600
After a week of terrible stories:

419
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,960
Military crackdown in Thailand,
VA scandal, Greek neo-natzis.

420
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,880
It was truly heartwarming
seeing two children

421
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,400
celebrating in a cloud of confetti.

422
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,200
And watch how long it took for
CNN anchor Chris Cuomo to ruin it.

423
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,880
It feels pretty good because
not only do I get the victory,

424
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,400
I get to share it
with someone else.

425
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,080
Between the two of you,

426
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,680
you're going to have to figure out
a way to decide who's better.

427
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,320
Is there any kind of other competition
that you're thinking up,

428
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,920
where you kind of meet in an alley
or a predetermined pizzeria,

429
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,240
and you just have it out
for your own sake,

430
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,480
mono a mono, at some point.

431
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,960
I think that we're both quite satisfied
with our performances yesterday,

432
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,560
so I don't think
that that's quite necessary.

433
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,400
Yes !

434
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,720
Chris Cuomo, I've got a question:
what the fuck is wrong with you ?

435
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,280
Who goes to a spelling bee

436
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,560
and, when there's a tie,
has the instinct, "finish him !" ?

437
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,160
There's a word for Chris Cuomo,
but I don't know how to spell it.

438
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,160
Kids, would you mind helping me ?

439
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,520
- "A."
- Yes.

440
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,520
- "S."
- Good.

441
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,280
-"S."
- Go on...

442
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,360
"H." "O." "L." "E."

443
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,960
That's correct.
That's exactly what Chris Cuomo is !

444
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,160
You're all winners !
Congratulations everyone.

445
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,800
Thank you so much for watching !
We'll be back next Sunday.

446
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,800
Have a great week, goodnight !

447
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,120
END OF EPISODE 5
