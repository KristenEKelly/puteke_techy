LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,560
EPISODE 22

3
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,080
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,160
Thank you so much for joining us.
Time for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,360
And it began
with claims that Russia

6
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,920
was taking aggressive
action against another country.

7
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,240
The search is expanding for what's
believed to be a Russian submarine

8
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,240
lurking near Sweden's capital.

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,960
Sweden  ! I did not see that coming.

10
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,120
Although if this is true, I can
understand where Putin is coming from.

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,080
Because who hasn't spent
twenty minutes in Ikea

12
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,320
and immediately wanted
to launch an attack on Sweden ?

13
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,480
Someone has to pay for
what I'm going through here !

14
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,000
This wasn't just classic Swedish
paranoia. They had proof.

15
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,520
Powerful sonar now scanning
beneath these waves

16
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,680
after the Swedes reportedly intercepted
an emergency call from these waters

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,200
to a Russian base
in nearby Kaliningrad.

18
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:32,040
And there is this: A photo taken
by a passerby outside Stockholm

19
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,000
looking very much
like a submarine on patrol.

20
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,720
Does it look like
a submarine on patrol ?

21
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,440
Because that could equally
be a whale with a toupee,

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,320
or a penguin on a surfboard, or
absolutely anything else in the world.

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,400
Even the swedes weren't exactly clear
what they were dealing with.

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,200
It could be a submarine,
or a smaller submarine.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,800
It could be a diver using some form
of moped-like underwater vehicle,

26
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,000
and divers who don't have
any business in our territory.

27
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,600
"It could even be the legendary shark
that terrorizes Swedish waters.

28
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,680
I talk, of course, of "Yawss. Yawss.
The monster of the seas."

29
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,640
Now, look,
a brief word of caution here:

30
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,960
Sweden, has got this wrong before.

31
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,480
In 1995, after suggesting
that Russia subs were offshore,

32
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,400
their Prime Minister had to make
an embarrassing retraction saying:

33
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,120
"It's a sad fact that
what was originally stated

34
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,640
to be intrusions into our waters
have proved to be minks."

35
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,600
Yes, minks. These minks.
Remember that photo from before ?

36
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,840
That could absolutely be a mink.

37
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,640
Or, it could be a submarine
"piloted" by a mink. We don't know.

38
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,560
And if it was, you let them
take over your country.

39
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,080
They are pissed when they're angry.
I'm sure the Swedish people

40
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,280
will stop at nothing
to get to the bottom of this mystery.

41
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,040
A Swedish navy has called off

42
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,200
a week-long search
for suspected underwater activity.

43
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,680
What that's it ?
You looked for a week and gave up ?

44
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,520
No, Sweden.
That's not how it works.

45
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,640
If you see a fuzzy photo of something,

46
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,400
you let it consume you
for the rest of your life.

47
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,840
Scotland has been looking
for the Loch Ness Monster since 1933 !

48
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,920
And you give up looking for a Russian
submarine after seven days ?

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,720
In America,
most of us spent the last three weeks

50
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,920
trying to figure out whether we'd seen
Ben Affleck's penis in "Gone Girl" !

51
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,880
And yes, technically
it could've been a mink.

52
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,760
But the point is, we wont' stop
until we get to the bottom of it !

53
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,560
Shame on you, Sweden.

54
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,920
But let, let let's move on,
in New York,

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,360
we've had our own unwelcome intruder
this week, albeit of a tinier variety.

56
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,760
Breaking news, overnight,
ebola in New York.

57
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,400
An American doctor who volunteered
for Doctors Without Borders in Guinea

58
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,880
is in a New York hospital
this morning with ebola.

59
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,600
Yes, much like an actor who considers
himself too intellectual for LA,

60
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,600
ebola has moved to New York.

61
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,760
The patient in question
is Dr. Craig Spencer,

62
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,360
who is currently recovering
in a hospital here in the city.

63
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,200
Public health officials
tried to calm people down

64
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,960
by supplying us
with a weirdly detailed rundown

65
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,400
of everywhere
he had been including this...

66
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,520
We know that he went
to a place called 'The Gutter',

67
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,480
a bowling alley in Williamsburg,
in Brooklyn.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,040
The patient went there with friends,
and he did bowl.

69
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,040
Of course he did. Of Course he went
to a bowling alley in Williamsburg.

70
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,120
If you're talking about a 33 year-old
white New Yorker named "Craig,"

71
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,640
you don't have to tell me

72
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,880
he spent a weeknight
at a bowling alley in Williamsburg.

73
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,120
That is assumed.

74
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,400
But maybe the most incredible part
of Thursday's ebola coverage

75
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,400
was how quickly things escalated.

76
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,000
Watch how his relationship status
was described,

77
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,560
because it changed a bit
towards the end.

78
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,200
He had some sort of physical contact
with his girlfriend.

79
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,800
He has a girlfriend,
who has now been quarantined as well.

80
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,360
Dr. Spencer's girlfriend
has been isolated now as well.

81
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,720
His girlfriend.

82
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,440
He has been in close contact
with his fiancÃ©e.

83
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,360
Mazel tov !

84
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Okay, two options
for what happened there:

85
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,880
One, he was engaged all along.

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,480
Or two, he got engaged
after being diagnosed with ebola.

87
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,560
And I'm going for the first one.

88
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,760
If you learn "one thing" from that
press conference, America, know this:

89
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,920
There is "no way" an attractive doctor
is not engaged by 33.

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,040
You lock that shit down.

91
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,400
You lock that shit down, you put
a ring on it and you lock it down.

92
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,680
For the other 8 million people in this
city, the advice is pretty obvious.

93
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,720
Ebola is not airborne, so there's only
one thing we all have to remember:

94
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,400
If you came across some strange
mucus or feces or something out there

95
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,880
on the subway, the street
or anywhere else, don't eat it.

96
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,320
That's good advice,
that is solid advice.

97
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,760
Don't eat mystery mucus in the street
until this ebola panic is over,

98
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,920
at which point, feel free
to resume your mucus consumption.

99
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,800
You may remember we talked
about the fact that the Supreme Court

100
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,040
bans cameras releasing
audiotapes of their oral arguments.

101
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,760
We decided to assist the news

102
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,200
by producing our 'real animals
fake paws Supreme Court'

103
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,640
with dog versions of all 9 justices,
plus two lawyers,

104
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,960
a duck assistant
and a chicken stenographer.

105
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,920
Or, or as you might say,
a "hen"ographer.

106
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,320
We then gave the footage away
on our Youtube page

107
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,720
for major news networks to use.

108
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,080
None of them did so, because they're
cowards who hate the concept of joy.

109
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,960
But, but, but the internet at large
stepped up in a spectacular way.

110
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,440
Many entire Supreme Court
cases are now online.

111
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,080
Thank you so much
to everyone who took part.

112
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,280
I want to single out one contribution,
from Youtube username Sam Gross.

113
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,040
He broke the rules a little bit,

114
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,040
because he didn't use
a Supreme Court oral argument.

115
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,160
But he took a different court case,
with which you may be familiar. Enjoy !

116
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,280
Lt. Kendrick ordered the code red
because that's what you told him to do.

117
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,440
When it went bad,
you cut these guys loose !

118
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,280
You had Markinson sign
a phony transfer order,

119
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,080
and you doctored the log book !

120
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,600
Colonel Jessup,
did you order the code red ? !

121
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,520
- You don't have to answer !
- I'll answer.

122
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,640
- You want answers ?
- I think I'm entitled.

123
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,000
- You want answers ?
- I want the truth !

124
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,760
You can't handle the truth !

125
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,360
Moving on,
let's talk about Halloween.

126
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,080
You have just four days to find
your inappropriately sexy costume,

127
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,160
whether it's sexy Barney the Dinosaur,
or a sexy candy corn,

128
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,440
or as Playboy's website featured,
and I swear to you this is true,

129
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,600
a sexy John Oliver costume;
that's right.

130
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,160
That is an actual photo,
of a human woman,

131
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,160
dressed-up to look
like a sexy me.

132
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,560
And the worst thing is,
there's more than one photo.

133
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,440
I don't know if I've ever been
as confused as I am right now.

134
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,960
Although I'm pretty sure
that I'm not as confused

135
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,720
as Louis CK is about
"his" sexy doppelganger.

136
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,320
That's also real.

137
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,520
Let's agree: sexy Halloween costumes
have simply gone too far.

138
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,280
But it doesn't matter. Because we all
know what Halloween is really about.

139
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,560
Candy. Sweet, sugar treats.

140
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,920
This Halloween, Americans
will spend $2.2 billion on candy,

141
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,080
although to be fair,
that "does" include Necco Wafers,

142
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,200
which might be better classified
as a coagulated dust.

143
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,200
But is it really fair
to describe sugar as a treat,

144
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,920
considering how much we eat it
all year round ?

145
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,560
Today the average American consumes
22 teaspoons of sugar a day.

146
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,280
Three times what we need.

147
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,160
That equal
to 75 pounds of sugar a year

148
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,800
for every man, woman and child
in the United States.

149
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,520
Holy shit ! 75 pounds of sugar !

150
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,520
That's like eating Michael Cera's
weight in sugar every single year.

151
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,640
Whilst that's a little less
than it was in the late '90s,

152
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,520
it's still pretty incredible.

153
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,160
So let's talk about sugar.
Everyone loves it.

154
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,200
That's because
we are genetically programmed to.

155
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,880
Eric Stice, a neuroscientist
at the Oregon Research Institute,

156
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,120
is using functional MRI scanners

157
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,680
to learn how
our brains respond to sweetness.

158
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,560
Sugar activates our brain
in a special way

159
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,120
that's very reminiscent
of drugs like cocaine.

160
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,720
Sugar activates our brains
like cocaine. And I've gotta say,

161
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,880
"Scarface" would be a very different
movie if it ended with Al Pacino

162
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,280
sitting in a chair, sugared out
of his mind on baked goods.

163
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,360
"Say hello to my Little Debbie !
Say hello !"

164
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,680
With sugar being
so viscerally appealing to us,

165
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,640
it's frankly no wonder that food
manufacturers put it in everything.

166
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,440
And I do mean everything.

167
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,960
35% of the sugars that Americans
consume come from beverages.

168
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,480
But we're also talking about
salad dressings and ketchup,

169
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,720
and breads and cereals
and crackers,

170
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,040
and the list goes on and on,
even to beef and turkey jerky.

171
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,080
We have no idea how prevalent sugar
is in almost everything that we eat.

172
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,400
Look at Clamato juice the original
tomato cocktail with clam.

173
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,200
One serving
has 11 grams of sugar in it.

174
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,160
So they clearly thought, "Let's
improve the taste by adding sugar,"

175
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,080
instead of thinking, "Let's improve
the taste by removing the clam."

176
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,280
And, and, none of this,
none of this would be a problem,

177
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,760
were it not for the fact that excess
sugar is probably not good for us.

178
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,400
Both the World Health Organization
and the American Heart Association

179
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,440
have warned against the harms
of eating too much of it.

180
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,000
Some studies suggest that too
much sugar can mess with the brain.

181
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,800
This rat is perfectly healthy.
Put him in a vat of water

182
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,480
and he
finds his way to safety every time.

183
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,640
5.2.

184
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,160
Now, look at this guy.

185
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,120
What he's been eating is the equivalent
of a North American diet,

186
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,560
complete with all the fats
and sugars we regularly consume.

187
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,080
He doesn't know where to go:
his brain has been damaged.

188
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,240
I don't think that rat
is unable to find the island.

189
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,240
I think it is saying "fuck that island,
there's no sugar on that island,

190
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,920
I want sugar !"

191
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,560
That's a Pixar movie
waiting to happen.

192
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,240
But the sweetener industry
is not going to take the findings

193
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,280
of a wet,
confused rat lying down.

194
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,120
They are an immensely powerful,
$5 billion industry,

195
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,240
who fought for decades to project
their product's health benefits.

196
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,240
The Sugar Association used to claim
their product was a diet aid,

197
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,400
with ads positioning it as a cure
for "the fat time of day",

198
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,240
with a woman saying, "if sugar can fill
that hollow feeling, I'm all for it."

199
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,840
Because yes, nothing says
"I don't feel hollow inside"

200
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,600
like a woman sitting alone
eating straight from a bag of sugar.

201
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,040
The Sugar Association has gotten
a little more sophisticated since then.

202
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,720
Here is their president.

203
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,120
As it relates to obesity, there's been
plenty of science that exonerates sugar.

204
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,520
It clarifies sugar does not, does not
contribute to obesity or diabetes.

205
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,920
Really ? Sugar doesn't contribute
to obesity ?

206
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,200
I'm not saying it's the only culprit,
but it's one of the key suspects.

207
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,480
Asking what causes obesity

208
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,640
is like asking who killed
a first grade class's hamster.

209
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,920
Sure, they all killed it in a way,
but I think we all know,

210
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,680
one of them killed it the most.

211
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,600
Kevin, you killed that hamster,
and you drove your father away.

212
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,280
There, I've said it Kevin.
I've said it.

213
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,040
Although, to be fair...
Take it down !

214
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,680
There are scientists who dismiss
links between sugars and obesity.

215
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,120
For instance, this guy !

216
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,680
We take a complex situation
like obesity and we say,

217
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,400
'if gee, if we could just cut down
on sugar-sweetened beverages,

218
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,520
or added sugars in general,
that would solve obesity,'

219
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,640
and I think that is a very slippery
slope, and almost certainly wrong.

220
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,520
That is Dr. James Rippe.
Who, like Clamato Juice,

221
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,920
turns out to contain quite a lot
of hidden sugar himself.

222
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,360
He's on payroll of the Corn Refiners
Association, the corn syrup people,

223
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,160
and at one point, he was receiving
a" $41,000 a month retainer from them.

224
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,600
That's half a million dollars a year !

225
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,640
You'd expect much grander claims
than it doesn't link to obesity.

226
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,920
He should be saying
"My research finds that corn syrup

227
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,840
makes you an immortal sex god
with x-ray vision !"

228
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,600
And I'm not saying that corporate
money distorts science.

229
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,400
But when researchers looked
at two sets of weight gain studies

230
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,000
one group with conflicts of interest
and one group that was independent.

231
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,400
The vast majority of independent
studies found direct links

232
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,560
between sugar sweetened soft drinks,
and obesity.

233
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,080
The vast majority that weren't
independent, found the opposite of that.

234
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,320
Particularly suspicious
was a research paper titled,

235
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,000
"I'm so Delicious"
attributed to a Dr. Pepper

236
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,960
but look: regardless of whether
sugar is terrible for you,

237
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,280
or the answer
to all life's problems,

238
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,520
shouldn't you at least get to know
when it's being added to your food ?

239
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,920
To their credit,
the FDA is trying to take this on.

240
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,400
This week the FDA is reviewing
new nutritional labeling standards.

241
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,680
And that may force food makers
to not just list total sugar content

242
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,800
but how much sugar
they are adding to their products.

243
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,440
The FDA is trying to get an added
sugar category onto their food labels.

244
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,720
Which is fine.

245
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,920
As long as it doesn't distract them
from forcing Honeycomb cereal

246
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,800
to reveal what in god's name
their old mascot was.

247
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,600
What the fuck was that ?

248
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,520
It looked like some kind
of tumbleweed made of Merkins.

249
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,800
Being forced to reveal how much sugar
you are adding to people's food

250
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,360
might seem pretty mild.

251
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,640
There is no way the food manufacturing
industry is going to let that happen.

252
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,880
The FDA has been swarmed with letters
from every conceivable product,

253
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,320
from the National Yogurt Association
to The National Frozen Pizza Institute

254
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,720
to multiple representatives
of the Cranberry industry.

255
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,440
Cranberries are,
I think we can all agree,

256
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,400
nature's most disgusting berry.

257
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,560
Cranberries taste like cherries
who hate you.

258
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,680
Cranberries taste like what a raspberry
drinks before its colonoscopy.

259
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,240
And, and the industry knows it.

260
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,080
The head of the Ocean Spray company
wrote to the FDA, saying,

261
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,720
"Cranberries...
Are naturally low in sugar,

262
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,840
giving them a distinctly tart,
astringent, even unpalatable taste."

263
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,960
Yes, that's the head of Ocean Spray

264
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,720
describing its defining ingredient
as "unpalatable".

265
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,400
It's no wonder they want
certain cranberry products

266
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,360
to be exempted from the proposed
added sugars declaration,

267
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,200
which is tantamount to begging,
"please don't make us tell everyone

268
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,080
how much sugar we dump
on our garbage bog berry."

269
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,200
But the most revealing plea came from
the American Beverage Association,

270
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,320
who wrote that if there is to be
an "added sugar" label,

271
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,320
it must be measured in grams,
and not teaspoons,

272
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,360
because teaspoons are and I quote,

273
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,320
"may carry
an unfair negative connotation

274
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,720
that undermines the factual nature
of nutrition information."

275
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,480
Which is ridiculous.

276
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,000
What negative connotation
does a fucking teaspoon have ?

277
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,560
Unless you're thinking
of an annoying dude at a diner

278
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,240
who's always trying
to balance one on his nose

279
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,080
or the fact that they're used
to freebase heroin ?

280
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,680
But neither of which
is the teaspoon's fault.

281
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,760
The only reason
the beverage people

282
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,920
want sugar to be measured
in grams instead of teaspoons

283
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,520
is that people understand
what a teaspoon is.

284
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,840
No one understands
the metric system.

285
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:37,040
Which is why this proposed FDA
food label is missing the point.

286
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,840
If they want us to understand
how much sugar is in our food,

287
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,080
they need to find a measurement
we can immediately grasp.

288
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,600
And that is why we are proposing,
in the spirit of Halloween,

289
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,880
that product manufacturers
express their sugar content

290
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,160
in the form of candy.

291
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,240
Specifically, Circus Peanuts,
the most disgusting of all the candies.

292
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,200
They taste like an elephant
ejaculated into a packet of Splenda.

293
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:09,600
And there is more than 5 grams of sugar
in each one of these horrifying things.

294
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,440
What we're saying to companies
is this...

295
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,200
Keep loading your products
up with as much sugar as you like.

296
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,360
On the one condition
that on the front of the packaging,

297
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,320
you display how much sugar it contains,
in the form of Circus Peanuts.

298
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,480
So, for instance,
64 ounces of Clamato Juice

299
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,560
has 88 grams of sugar,
or 16 peanuts' worth.

300
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,200
A can of Campbell's tomato soup ?
5 1/2 peanuts.

301
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,800
A package of 20 Circus Peanuts ?
Obviously, 20 circus peanuts.

302
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,000
But we as consumers must demand
manufacturers adopt this measurement.

303
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,520
So please tweet at them, using the
hashtag, "show us your peanuts".

304
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,680
And ask
your favorite food manufacturer,

305
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,080
to whip out their peanuts
and present them to you.

306
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,200
And if they say to you
"we don't want to,

307
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,320
that's embarrassing,
nobody wants to see our peanuts,

308
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,800
they're orange,
and misshapen, and bumpy,"

309
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,320
you tell them again:
Show us your peanuts.

310
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,560
Do it, food makers !
Expose your peanuts to the world !

311
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,960
Because if you are going to shove
your peanuts in our mouths,

312
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,280
the very least you can do is tell us
what we're swallowing.

313
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,920
And now, this !

314
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,200
Across the broad expansive history
there have been billions of idiots.

315
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,960
As well as a handful of smart people.

316
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,320
We interviewed some of the latter group
for our ongoing series,

317
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,320
"Great Minds,
People Who Think Good".

318
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,200
This week's people
who thinks good, Jane Goodall.

319
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,440
In her 20s, Jane Goodall
achieved her childhood dream,

320
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,440
to live with and study
the Chimpanzees in Africa.

321
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,240
To whom she gave exotic names.

322
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,720
Hello Mike !

323
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,400
She had no formal training
or even an undergraduate degree,

324
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,360
but the discoveries
of this daring young woman

325
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,480
revolutionized
our understanding of these primates.

326
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,280
Starting with this bombshell.

327
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,000
The Chimpanzee is actually
modifying a natural object

328
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,080
to suit it to a specific purpose,
thus making a tool.

329
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,760
That's right. Chimps were making
and using tools,

330
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,400
albeit pretty crappy tools
for a pretty disgusting purpose...

331
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,760
but she also found something else.

332
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,360
Chimpanzees, like humans,
have a dark side to their nature.

333
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,200
Goodall was also the first to show
that these peaceful forest vegetarians

334
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,080
were actually meat eating assholes

335
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,080
who frequently who engaged in Chimpy
- Chimpy on Chimp - Chimposide.

336
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,240
After decades in the field,
Goddall now spends her time

337
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,200
traveling the world
to fight for a variety of causes.

338
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,000
With occasional interruptions
to speak with a not so smart person.

339
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,480
Dr. Jane Goddall, thank you so much
for taking the time to speak with me.

340
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,880
Well thank you for inviting me.

341
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,720
You are widely recognized as one
of the great experts on chimpanzee's,

342
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,080
what makes them particularly
so fascinating to you ?

343
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,600
I think because they're so like us,
and we now know biologically

344
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,000
we share 98 plus percent of our DNA
with them.

345
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,320
Blood system, the immune system,
the structure of the brain,

346
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,400
its all almost all the same,
just our brain is bigger.

347
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,080
And then for me,
of course, its the behavior...

348
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,800
The fact they have personalities,
they have happiness, sadness, fear.

349
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,080
They communicate with kissing,
embracing, holding hands,

350
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,480
patting one another on the back,
shaking the fist.

351
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,680
They use tools.

352
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,160
Is that what makes them
such great pets ?

353
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,600
Pets...

354
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,160
They're the worst possible...
they're not pets.

355
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,520
I can't even say they're bad pets
because they're not pets.

356
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,480
They're nice acquaintances,
house bound friends.

357
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,520
They're not... there very cute and
sweet and cuddly when they're little

358
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,320
and what happens
when they're 5, 6, 7,

359
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,840
and why do people
have their face bitten off ?

360
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,360
Focus on the fact that when you
dress them up, they're so funny.

361
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,520
No they're not.

362
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,840
- What about a chimpanzee butler ?
- No.

363
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,200
At no point, in your time,
living amongst chimpanzees

364
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:28,280
did you think about pulling out
a monocle, a top hat and a silver tray

365
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,760
and training them
to bring you a cold drink ?

366
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,560
At no point did I think
any such ridiculous thing.

367
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,720
- Did you ever put a hat on them ?
- No.

368
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,800
- Never put a hat on a chimpanzee ?
- No.

369
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,560
I refuse to believe that.

370
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,760
We shall disagree
for the rest of our lives.

371
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,440
Okay, fair enough,
let's talk a little about your methods.

372
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,600
They were not enough
without their initial criticisms.

373
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,520
At one point of contention was that
you gave your chimps nicknames.

374
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,600
Why did people criticize that ?

375
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,800
- Not nicknames, names, just names.
- Just actual names.

376
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,760
Yes. I was, to be scientific,
I should have given them numbers.

377
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,120
What is the scientific argument
for not giving them names ?

378
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,160
If you give them a name
you're treating them like people.

379
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,640
I'm going to throw some names at you
and I want you to say

380
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,560
if you think they would be a good name
for a chimp or a bad name for a chimp.

381
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,440
- "Jessica Chimpson".
- Yucky.

382
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,680
- "Dr Ban Anapeel MD".
- Too long.

383
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,720
This is a little simpler....

384
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,200
- "Poo-throw Wilson."
- That's alright.

385
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,880
- Right ?
- Yeah, that's fine.

386
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,840
- That's good...
- "Poo-Throw-somebody-else".

387
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,880
Where are you going there ?

388
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,040
Poo Throw at people that I think
need poo thrown at them.

389
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,080
Jane who do you think
needs poo-thrown at them.

390
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,880
I'm going to pick somebody
like Hitler because he's gone.

391
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,560
"Poo Throw Hitler", great.

392
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,280
- An amazing name for a chimp.
- Fantastic !

393
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,800
While you were living with them,

394
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,840
you learnt that chimps
had specific vocalizations,

395
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,880
can you tell me
a little about that ?

396
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,160
If I'm eating something,
and you want some...

397
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,560
And you come up to me.
You might beg. Just like that.

398
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,640
But I don't want
to give you any so...

399
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,880
Pretty obvious.

400
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,880
No, you don't say that,
you say...

401
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,440
I ain't giving you any;
I don't like you.

402
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,800
Alright Poo-Throw Hitler,
take it down a notch.

403
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,200
Dr Jane Goodall,
thank you so much for talking with me.

404
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,280
Let's end this interview
in the traditional manner.

405
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,320
Thank you.
I should do it chimp-ways.

406
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,720
And we'd be going...

407
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,640
Excitement, food.

408
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,320
And finally tonight...
Let's talk about Toronto.

409
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,400
Because tomorrow morning,
they will choose a new mayor.

410
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,160
Now, sadly,
current mayor Rob Ford,

411
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,200
everyone's favorite
walking beefsteak tomato

412
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,680
is not running for re-election.

413
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,000
But don't despair,
for there is another...

414
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,880
Rob Ford has a brother, Doug Ford,
who "is" running for mayor.

415
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,720
If you wondering how alike they are,
please enjoy this little clip !

416
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
I got ya.

417
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,800
The funny thing,
like all typical siblings,

418
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,280
the goal is when you're on a seesaw
is to jack your sibling off.

419
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,880
You know what ?

420
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,240
You laugh, but he's right.

421
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,480
On a seesaw, you really
want to jack your sibling off.

422
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,360
You want to do anything to get him off.
Beat him off that seesaw.

423
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,920
Make him come, down to the ground
because you beat him off so hard.

424
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,160
On that seesaw.

425
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,680
But look, now, to become mayor,

426
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,640
Doug Ford has had some tricky
political obstacles to overcome.

427
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,760
His brother has allegedly used
anti-semitic language in the past.

428
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,840
Doug was asked about that in a debate
at a Jewish high school in Toronto.

429
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,560
I'm going to play you the first
few seconds of his response.

430
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,320
You know something ?
My, my doctor, my Jewish doctor,

431
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,320
my Jewish dentist, my Jewish lawyer,
my Jewish... hold it... accountant.

432
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,640
"Why, why is everyone booing ?
I love Jews !

433
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,880
I love everything about you ! The
tiny hats, the big crackers that you,

434
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,600
eat your weird Christmas candles !
I love it !

435
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,040
Why are you booing me ?"

436
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,240
It wasn't the best response, sure.
Which is why,

437
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,360
after having a night to sleep on it,
Doug took a second crack at it.

438
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,120
The Ford family
has an extensive relationship,

439
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,200
a great relationship
with the Jewish community.

440
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
Matter of fact,
my wife is Jewish.

441
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,160
How about that ? That is
a convenient fact to have remembered,

442
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,600
seemingly in the middle
of your sentence.

443
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:35,560
Unfortunately a local reporter
then casts doubt on Doug's claims,

444
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,160
forcing Doug Ford to bring out
his definitely Jewish wife

445
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,280
to talk about
her definitely Jewish heritage,

446
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,240
which went definitely
spectacularly well.

447
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,480
My mother's family
has Jewish bloodlines.

448
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,960
I don't practice Judaism.
I never have.

449
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,560
So listen,
she doesn't practice Jude-ism.

450
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,760
Hence, I guess her use
of the term "Jude-ism".

451
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,080
Though her ancestors may
or may not have been jude-esque.

452
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,240
None of this matters
because by that point,

453
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,600
Doug Ford had moved
on to his next scandal,

454
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,240
after being overheard
allegedly referring

455
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,560
to the journalist who'd questioned
his wife's "Jude-ism"

456
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,720
as "a little bitch", a charge
he then spectacularly denied...

457
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,400
I was falsely accused
from the Toronto Star.

458
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,520
I was having a private conversation
walking out with two staff members.

459
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,240
And I guess they just assumed I was
talking about someone in that room.

460
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,680
It had nothing to do with anyone
in that room last night, whatsoever.

461
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,840
I was talking
about a different little bitch,

462
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,760
in a completely different room.

463
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,280
If I was talking about that little
bitch, she'd know about it.

464
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,720
Why are you booing me ?"

465
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,120
Look, Toronto: I think I speak
on behalf of the rest of the world

466
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,080
when I deliver you this message.

467
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,960
Please, elect this man !

468
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,440
Sure, his brother was fun,
but at a certain point,

469
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,720
we felt bad laughing at him.

470
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,400
Whereas Doug Ford
doesn't have a drug problem,

471
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,640
he's just an asshole.

472
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,520
A non-chemically-assisted asshole.

473
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,840
So please, Toronto, I beg you !

474
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,480
Let us laugh at your asshole
for another four years.

475
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,880
Yours sincerely, everyone
who does not live in Toronto.

476
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,360
Thanks so much for watching,

477
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,600
we'll be back next week,
good night.

478
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,600
Some chimps can actually
roll their tongue, can you ?

479
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,400
Some people can.
You're one you can't.

480
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,720
- What does that mean ?
- I don't know.

481
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,960
- What's wrong with me ?
- Or what's wrong with me ?

482
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,440
- Let's put it that way.
- You're right, yeah.

483
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,960
END OF EPISODE 22
