1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,480
Welcome, welcome, welcome to "Last Week Tonight."

2
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,840
I'm John Oliver.

3
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,800
Just time for a quick recap of the week.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,600
If you haven't watched the news at all this week,
congratulations.

5
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,800
You've probably had a much nicer time than the rest of us.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,400
We will be talking about the terrible events in Missouri
later in the show,

7
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,040
but before we make you sad, please let us make you happy.

8
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,360
In the world of sport, a new star emerged this week.

9
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,400
WOMAN: 13-year-old ace Mo'ne Davis is officially the first
girl to pitch a shutout

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,400
in the 68-year history of the
Little League World Series.

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,920
And the strikes keep coming...

12
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,760
MAN: And she picks up her first strikeout
of the game.

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,600
WOMAN: and coming...

14
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,720
I love this girl.

15
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,880
The best part of Mo'ne Davis is not that she happens
to be female,

16
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,520
it's that she also happens to be awesome, waving her
fingers after strikeouts--

17
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,400
which, by the way, is absolutely what I'm going to do after any
successful joke in the future--

18
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,080
and also displaying
remarkable self-confidence.

19
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,480
I want my curveball
like Clayton Kershaw's

20
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,800
and my fastball like
Mo'ne Davis, so...

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,200
Ha ha ha!

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,760
JOHN: Yes!

23
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,240
How is she that self-confident
at 13 years old?

24
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,880
I'm not that self-confident now,
and I have a TV show.

25
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,800
But of all the wonderful things Mo'ne Davis did this week,
this is my favorite. 9

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,400
WOMAN: A ton of media attention surrounding you
coming into this game,

27
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,960
but you have handled it
so well.

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,800
Has it been hard for you?

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,200
Not really.
I can always say no, so...

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,840
Ha ha ha!

31
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,400
That's, like, my special
weapon for the media.

32
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,800
This girl is incredible.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,800
Saying no to dumb questions from the media is a special weapon
that everyone should use.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,560
"Oh, who are you wearing?"
"No!"

35
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,120
"What do you think of
the 2016 candidate?"

36
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,760
"No!"

37
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,800
"If you were a tree,
what tree--"

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,600
"No, no, no, no, no!"

39
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,760
Moving on to overseas news now,

40
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,800
and there were some strange developments concerning
Iranian men's testicles.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,800
Iran may be on the verge
of a baby boom.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,200
Media reports say Parliament has banned vasectomies for men and
similar procedures for women,

43
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,720
after Ayatollah Khamenei issued a decree to increase
the population.

44
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:55,240
Wow. The Ayatollah has given
vasectomies a vasectomy-ectomy.

45
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,160
And he's actively encouraging
the country to procreate.

46
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,120
That is one hell of a pickup line.

47
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:07,200
"Hey, baby, uh, want to come up to my apartment and
fully obey the Ayatollah?"

48
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,040
And the thing is, they're not
even stopping there.

49
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,800
WOMAN: The ban would also make it illegal to
advertise birth control.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,080
Violators would face fines
and prison time.

51
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,800
Prison time for advertising
birth control.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,640
Good luck with that
conversation.

53
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,120
"Oh, what are you in for?"
"Murder. How about you?"

54
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,360
"I tried to get the word out
about a ribbed condom."

55
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,960
This is especially bad news for
contraception mascots like

56
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,720
Iran's famous
Ivan the Living I.U.D.

57
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,160
"Hey, kids, I'm made of copper,

58
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,000
and if used as directed, I work for 5 years.
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!"

59
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,920
And finally this week, Crimea.

60
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,320
It has been 5 months since
it was annexed by Russia,

61
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,480
and last weekend there was
a celebration concert

62
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,800
featuring pretty much the last person that
anyone was expecting.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,800
Freedom to believe in
what you believe in.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,160
No man has the right
to condemn another man

65
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,400
for believing
what he believes in.

66
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,760
Thank you.

67
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,600
In case you're wondering, that is not Bono having
an allergic reaction.

68
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,640
That is Steven Seagal,
and incredibly...

69
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,120
and incredibly,
that wasn't even...

70
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,800
that wasn't even the weirdest
annexation-themed entertainment

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,680
that the people of Crimea experienced because
the day before,

72
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,400
a Russian motorcycle gang
called the Night Wolves

73
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,920
produced a dramatic retelling of the Crimean crisis,
and it had everything.

74
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,320
Dancers forming a flaming
swastika? Check.

75
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,160
Robots vomiting red paint onto
their drums? Check.

76
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,000
Man running around
on fire? Check.

77
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,960
Guy doing motorbike tricks in front of confused violinists?
Check, check, check.

78
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,400
The whole thing looked like Leni Riefenstahl hired
a colorblind pyromaniac

79
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,560
to choreograph
a Spinal Tap-themed

80
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,440
Cirque du Soleil performance
at the request of Satan himself.

81
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,080
And you know what?

82
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,800
It was phenomenal because say
what you will about Russians.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,720
You might not want them running
Crimea, but on this evidence,

84
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,960
you definitely want them running every Super Bowl
halftime show in the future.

85
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,000
And now, this.

86
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,440
ANNOUNCER: And now, people on TV
saying what people are saying.

87
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,120
Sooner or later, you have to
believe what people are saying.

88
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,400
I mean, we can
pull out a montage.

89
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,120
People are saying we're
against immigrants.

90
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,920
People are saying
buy, sell, hold.

91
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,280
People are saying, "Yeah,
guys, what'd you think?"

92
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,840
People are saying, "Hmm,
on second thought,

93
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,400
we probably should have
chosen the other guy."

94
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,360
People are saying something
to me, and I said,

95
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,760
"But you don't know
what I've been through."

96
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,960
People are saying they have
tiny little tattoos

97
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,960
on the back of their neck.

98
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,240
People are saying,
"I need to fly.

99
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,960
It's Fourth of July.
When do I go?"

100
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,840
People are saying, "Listen,
even with this insulin inhaler,

101
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,120
it's still not gonna sell."

102
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,120
People are saying, "Why
bother having laws at all?"

103
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,360
It's just stuff people
are saying.

104
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,680
Moving on...

105
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,400
Moving on.

106
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,120
Our main story tonight
concerns the past week's

107
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,720
terrible events in Missouri.

108
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,400
FEMALE ANCHOR: An officer shot an 18-year-old man outside an
apartment complex

109
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,880
in Ferguson, Missouri.

110
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,800
MALE ANCHOR: It is unclear at this hour what led
to the shooting,

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,800
but witnesses say
the teenager was unarmed.

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,800
MALE REPORTER: Angry confrontations between
protesters

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,400
and police in riot gear...

114
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,360
the same anger and outrage that exploded into a chaotic night
of looting and violence.

115
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,800
This whole story is
depressingly familiar,

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,480
and there are so many unanswered questions
regarding why an officer

117
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,400
would shoot
an unarmed teenager.

118
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,800
What is absolutely clear is that the police have handled
everything since then terribly, *

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,920
and the tone-deafness
began with this.

120
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,800
FEMALE REPORTER: Asked how
many times Brown was shot,

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,920
St. Louis County Police
Chief Jon Belmar said...

122
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,040
It was more than just a couple, but I don't think it was, uh,
uh, many more than that.

123
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:01,840
Just--just think about what he's saying there--not much
more than more than twice.

124
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,560
Could you try
and minimize this any more?

125
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,000
"Look, listen, everyone, only very many more than
one bullet was fired,

126
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,960
so everybody calm down,
shall we?"

127
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,960
The police then refused for days to release the name
of the officer involved,

128
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,840
and when they eventually did, they packaged it with a DVD
extra that no one wanted.

129
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,960
At the same time, they released
video of Michael Brown allegedly

130
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,520
carrying out a store robbery minutes before he was
shot and killed,

131
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,000
and that has sparked
new outrage.

132
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,840
Yeah, of course it has
because it's irrelevant.

133
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,120
If the police wanted to distract
everyone with a video

134
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,960
that has absolutely nothing to do with
Michael Brown's shooting,

135
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,840
they should have just released
"Ghostbusters" instead.

136
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,920
It's exactly as relevant to everything that
happened afterwards.

137
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,960
But the more the week went on,

138
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,840
the more you got the sense that
those in charge in Ferguson

139
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,040
don't have the best sense
of how their community feels.

140
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,800
Just listen to the mayor.

141
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,640
We've never seen
this kind of violence.

142
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,680
We've never seen this kind
of frustration or tension

143
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,920
between the races.

144
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,800
I've always been proud
to say that to people.

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,240
I know we've always
gotten along,

146
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,800
and I know our community
still gets along very well.

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,480
"Oh, we're absolutely
famous for it.

148
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,040
"Presumably, that is why I,
the mayor of Ferguson,

149
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,920
"am currently on national
fucking television.

150
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,920
Presumably we're talking about how well our town is getting
along right now and always has."

151
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,960
The thing is, if you ask around in Ferguson, you get
a slightly different story.

152
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,960
MAN: The cops' harassment
is frequently.

153
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,720
It's all through the day.
It's all through the night.

154
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,800
Then they're not beating us physically, they're
doing it verbally. $

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,920
Here's the thing the mayor
doesn't understand.

156
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,120
As a general rule, no one should
ever be allowed to say

157
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,640
there is no history
of racial tension here

158
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:50,120
because that sentence has never
been true anywhere on Earth.

159
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,800
Even in Antarctica...
even in Antarctica,

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,120
there is tension between emperor
penguins and gentoo penguins.

161
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,560
"Fuck you, gentoo penguins, flapping over here,
stealing our fish.

162
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,920
Not you, chinstrap penguins.
You're cool."

163
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,800
"You guys are good at math."

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,600
So which one of these two men is right about what life as
a young African-American

165
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,000
in Ferguson is like?

166
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,480
Well, to answer that, let's
look at the police force.

167
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,920
What does it look like in a town which is about 2/3
African-American?

168
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,240
What is the makeup of your
police force; the number

169
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,480
and how many of them
are white?

170
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,440
I just want
clarification of that.

171
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,800
KNOWLES: Uh, they keep saying
3 are African-American,

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,720
but that's--I actually
believe it's 5.

173
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,360
There was 6, but one left
fairly recently.

174
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,880
We also have a Hispanic and two
Asian Pacific Islanders.

175
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,320
Exactly. "Look, it doesn't
stop there, guys.

176
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,680
"We got a couple of white guys

177
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,760
"who occasionally listen
to hip-hop music.

178
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,800
"I mean, Macklemore, sure,
but still.

179
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,160
"Also, we have
6 Norwegian-Americans

180
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,520
"who really enjoyed
The Lion King on Broadway,

181
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,960
so it's not--it's more
diverse than it seems."

182
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,840
But despite the presence of both
of the Pacific Islanders

183
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,240
and, of course, "the Hispanic"--

184
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,720
let's not forget him--the Ferguson Police do seem
to target minorities.

185
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,160
FEMALE ANCHOR: 86% of police
stops are African-Americans;

186
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,600
92% of police searches,
nearly 93% of arrests.

187
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,560
Even though they stopped more blacks, more whites
had contraband.

188
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,160
Yeah, of course more whites
had contraband.

189
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,800
They knew that if you look like
this, you don't get stopped.

190
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,520
If you're white in Ferguson,

191
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,360
you would need to be snorting cocaine directly
off your dashboard

192
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,440
to get stopped by the police,

193
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,920
whereas, if you're an
African-American in Ferguson--

194
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,920
like, say, Henry Davis here-- you may have a slightly
different experience,

195
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,440
because while in custody
in the Ferguson jail in 2009,

196
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,800
officers grabbed him and pushed him and struck him
multiple times. 6

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,960
They say they were provoked, although, oddly, "There is
no video of this incident,

198
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,560
despite the fact the jail is
equipped with video cameras."

199
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,880
And what is known, though,
at this point,

200
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,680
is that he was later charged with 4 counts of destruction
of city property

201
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,920
for bleeding on their uniforms.

202
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,800
And I've got to say, he was lucky that he wasn't
eating spaghetti

203
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,480
at the time of his beating,

204
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,800
or they would have upgraded
that charge to a felony.

205
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,760
And that is just
the local police.

206
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,800
The county police also have
had their share of problems.

207
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,800
A St. Louis County police lieutenant is without
a job tonight.

208
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,800
He was fired for allegedly
ordering patrol officers

209
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,880
to arrest black people
shopping in South County.

210
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,080
Oh, it wasn't just that he
ordered racial profiling.

211
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,840
It was how he allegedly did it,
with his colleagues claiming

212
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,960
that he said things like,
"Let's have a black day"

213
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,400
and "Let's make the jail cells
more colorful."

214
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,880
Now, let's be fair.
Let's be fair here.

215
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:56,960
"Let's have a black day" is an awesome thing to say
if you are Shaft.

216
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,920
And "Let's make the jail
cells more colorful"

217
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,280
is entirely appropriate if
you're an interior designer

218
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,960
with a folder full
of paint swatches.

219
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,880
However, if you're
a white police officer,

220
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,440
it's not ideal to say
either of those,

221
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,720
which is not to say
that all cops are bad.

222
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,360
They are clearly not.

223
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,680
Also, the people of Ferguson want and need
an effective police force,

224
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,160
but perhaps their relationship was best summed up by this photo
from earlier this week.

225
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,960
Not just ludicrously aggressive police facing off
against an unarmed man,

226
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,880
but also the fact that someone had clearly written "Fuck the
police" on the post box,

227
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,760
something that apparently CNN
did not notice when they

228
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,960
were using this photo during
all of their coverage.

229
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,800
So they didn't see it.

230
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,640
Now, you might also notice in
that photo that the police are

231
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,160
troublingly dressed like they're about to launch
an assault on Fallujah.

232
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,240
Well, it turns out that
that is no coincidence.

233
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,960
Since 1996, in response to the war on drugs,

234
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,320
the Department of Defense transferred $4.3 billion
in military equipment

235
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,880
to local and state police.

236
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,160
After 9/11, the Department
of Homeland Security

237
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,880
made additional equipment available
to local law enforcement

238
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,640
through federal funds for
terrorism prevention.

239
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,760
That's right, and this has
happened on such a scale

240
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,880
that it's enabled small towns
like Keene, New Hampshire,

241
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,240
to apply for a Bearcat,
a military-grade,

242
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,280
armored personnel truck,
which they needed because,

243
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,480
as their application argued, "The terrorism threat is far
reaching and often unforeseen"

244
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,280
and cited as a possible target
their annual Pumpkin Festival.

245
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:47,480
Specifically, this Pumpkin Festival, which is now
being protected by this.

246
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,920
And good luck easily
outmaneuvering that,

247
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,960
teenagers with baseball bats.

248
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,760
And if you are wondering what it feels like to have
a mine-resistant vehicle

249
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,280
on the streets of your town,

250
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,480
I give you a YouTube video of two dudes from
Saginaw, Michigan.

251
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,880
MAN: Holy shit, dude.

252
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,400
SECOND MAN:
Super-armored, dude.

253
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,800
Damn! Look, he doesn't want
anybody to see him in there.

254
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,800
Dude, you can't even see
him! Dude! That's crazy.

255
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,400
Saginaw County Sheriff,
dude.

256
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,400
That's cool, dude. Look how big these tires
are compared to our--

257
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,000
It's taller than--
It's--dude.

258
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,880
That's awesome!

259
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,200
Now, to be fair,
to be fair,

260
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:37,400
that is exactly how they reacted when a Chipotle
first opened there.

261
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,000
But the point is, listen carefully as one of them
suddenly realizes something. 4

262
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,800
Here's the thing:
no, it hasn't got that bad,

263
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,400
because unless you live
in downtown Kabul,

264
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,600
there is no practical need for
anything like that in your town.

265
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,120
Just ask the people
that it came from.

266
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,400
The Army itself, actually, in
a newsletter a few months ago,

267
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,920
recommended against using MRAPs
even at U.S. military bases.

268
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,440
You know, on paved streets in the United States,
they're actually unsafe.

269
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,320
They tear up the streets, they
have a high rollover potential.

270
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,240
Exactly. The only vehicle that should be tearing up
the streets of Saginaw

271
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,840
is Chad's souped-up
Honda Civic.

272
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:34,400
"Dudes! Dude, my car
is sick, dude!"

273
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,720
The police are not soldiers, so why, in this photo
from Ferguson,

274
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,960
are they wearing fucking camo?

275
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,200
They are northwest of St. Louis,
not northwest of the Amazon.

276
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:53,720
If they want to blend in with their surroundings, they should
be dressed as a dollar store.

277
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,880
And also, look in the photo at where their guns are pointed.

278
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,720
If you were actually in the military, you would know that
you are not supposed to do that.

279
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,920
In the military, we're trained on something called
escalation of force,

280
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,440
which basically means the only time that you are really
gonna point a weapon

281
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,720
directly at someone is when you're ready to
pull the trigger.

282
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,880
And instead of that,
we've seen in Ferguson

283
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,400
that police are just wandering
around with their

284
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,960
weapons up at all times,

285
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,400
pointing them at people that
obviously didn't pose a threat.

286
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,280
Whoa. Well, they don't currently
pose a threat, but, you know,

287
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,320
it's really all about
what they might do.

288
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,960
Now, they could, for instance,
join the police,

289
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,920
be given a gun they're not
trained to use properly,

290
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,720
and then wander around
pointing it at people.

291
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,800
That would be fucking
terrifying.

292
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,200
The point here is...

293
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,200
the point is, if you are a cop
in the United States,

294
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,040
you should dress for the job you
have, not the job you want,

295
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,320
because if you have all this equipment, it's going
to go to your head.

296
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,560
Look at Doraville, Georgia,
population 8,500.

297
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,840
The police there got a tank a while back,
and up until a few days ago,

298
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:13,280
this video was on
the front page of their website.

299
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,440
We're gonna stop a burglary
at Little Caesar's

300
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,800
We're gonna stop a burglary
at Little Caesar's

301
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Aah! Aah!

302
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,360
The name of that song is--
and this is true--

303
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,200
"Die, Motherfucker, Die."

304
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,720
And it was a good choice
because, believe me,

305
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,520
that video does not pair well
with Simon and Garfunkel.

306
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,240
SIMON AND GARFUNKEL:  Lookin'
for fun and feelin' groovy

307
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,200
Now, that video was just
a training exercise,

308
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,760
but the problem is police departments don't just use
this stuff for training.

309
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,040
Thanks in part to this kind of
access to military hardware,

310
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,600
there has been a massive rise in both the number and the use of
police department SWAT teams.

311
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,240
NARRATOR: The number of SWAT raids have gone up by 1,400%
since the 1980s.

312
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,880
An estimated 50,000 now
take place every year.

313
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,440
MAN: Face down!

314
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,680
Face down!

315
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,920
Just keep that clip in mind
when I tell you

316
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,960
that 79% of SWAT deployments are now for executing
search warrants,

317
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,920
and most of those were
for drug investigations.

318
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,400
So, yes, if you are getting high in your dorm room right now,
you are not paranoid.

319
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,160
There is a SWAT team outside,

320
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,880
and they are
coming to get you...

321
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,440
all of which brings us back
to this week and to Ferguson.

322
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,480
So how do you
improve things there?

323
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,640
Well, you could de-militarize the police force to stop
things looking like this,

324
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,120
but that would just
change the optics.

325
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,720
The substance of the problem
would still be there,

326
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,200
as was embodied by a police officer on the streets of
Ferguson this week,

327
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,040
who was dressed
entirely normally.

328
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,800
The phrase "bring it,
you fucking animals"

329
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,560
is barely acceptable
during a zoo escape.

330
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,800
It's not even acceptable in the restaurant in "Mary Poppins"
where penguins are waiters.

331
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,800
"Bring it,
you fucking animal."

332
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,400
"Hey, don't treat them
like that.

333
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,800
"They'll piss in your soup.

334
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,800
They'll piss in your soup,
and you'll deserve it."

335
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,400
That kind of statement betrays

336
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,400
an inability to see the citizens
of Ferguson as individuals

337
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,840
and instead treats them
as a threatening whole.

338
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,160
And that is a top-down problem
because last night,

339
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,440
this is how the governor of Missouri decided to
try and rebuild trust

340
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,320
between the police
and the community.

341
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,320
I signed an order declaring
a state of emergency

342
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,240
and ordering the implementation
of a curfew

343
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,280
in the impacted
area of Ferguson.

344
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,800
Oh, perfect.

345
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,800
So you took a community tired of
being treated as criminals

346
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,240
and imprisoned them all in
their own houses for a night,

347
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,200
and in doing so, employed the tone of a pissed-off
vice principal

348
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,920
trying to restore order
at an assembly.

349
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,800
If we're going
to achieve justice,

350
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,440
we must first have

351
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,080
and maintain peace.

352
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,000
This is a test.

353
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,880
The eyes of the world
are watching.

354
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,480
That is profoundly
patronizing.

355
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,600
"Look, let's see if you can all
remain quiet for 20 minutes,

356
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,560
and then we'll see if you can
all go and play outside."

357
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,640
If even the governor
can't distinguish

358
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,280
between the good and the bad
elements of the community

359
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,640
and has decided to punish
everyone equally,

360
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,480
then that should go both ways.

361
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,480
I know the police love their ridiculous, unnecessary
military equipment,

362
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,600
so here's another
patronizing test.

363
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,840
Let's take it all
away from them,

364
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,880
and if they can make it through a whole month without killing
a single unarmed black man,

365
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,720
then and only then can they get
their fucking toys back.

366
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,920
And now, this.

367
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,600
ANNOUNCER: And now...

368
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,800
I think I need to have
my ears fixed.

369
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,400
Did I hear this?

370
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,800
Did I hear you say they went
back some days later?

371
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,400
Did I hear you say that both parents worked
a graveyard shift?

372
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,400
GRACE: Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
Did I hear you say house arrest?

373
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,800
Did you say that?

374
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,040
Sex every night?
Is that what I just heard?

375
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,840
GRACE: Did I hear that right,
or did my IFB just flip out?

376
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,480
All right, what did you say?

377
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,880
You had to say something then because I'd do a back flip
if I heard that.

378
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,520
Have you ever
smoked pot?

379
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,400
I'm sorry. What?

380
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,040
Finally, finally
tonight, women.

381
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,200
What do they want?

382
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,880
It's a question that's plagued no less an authority
than movie star

383
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,640
and noted humanitarian
Mel Gibson.

384
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,120
Uh, not to be confused with his
far less successful follow-up,

385
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,200
"Why Are Jews?"

386
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,600
But for most--
but for most American women,

387
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,840
one thing they might want is
to be paid the same as men,

388
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,040
and one prominent man
currently agrees.

389
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,240
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Women deserve
equal pay for equal work!

390
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,920
Equal pay kicked off
your presidency.

391
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,360
It's become
really a theme,

392
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,360
one of the themes
of your time here.

393
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,760
Well, that's nice. Equal pay is not such
a bad theme.

394
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,760
It's certainly an improvement over previous
presidential themes,

395
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,840
including "Let's lock up all the Japanese" and "Destroy
the Seminole scourge."

396
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,280
Unfortunately, as is so often
the case for this president,

397
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,520
his laudable goal was muddled
right from the outset.

398
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,840
Today, the average full-time
working woman earns

399
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,840
just 77 cents
for every dollar a man earns.

400
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,080
Equal pay for equal work.
It's not that complicated.

401
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,720
Yeah, it shouldn't be
that complicated,

402
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,200
and as long as he hasn't overlooked something which
complicates this significantly,

403
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,440
everything should
still be on track.

404
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,480
GRETA VAN SUSTEREN: In 2013,

405
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,840
female staffers in the Obama

406
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,000
White House were paid

407
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,320
less than 88 cents

408
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,440
for every dollar paid

409
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,920
to male staffers.

410
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,520
Well, that's OK, that's OK.

411
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,080
Maybe that just means
the president was 88% sincere

412
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,280
when he talked about equal pay,
which, if you round it up,

413
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,560
is basically 100% anyway,
so why is everyone complaining?

414
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,160
And with that,
all anyone could focus on

415
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,920
was not how to fix this problem
but how to quantify it.

416
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,200
The Labor Department itself,

417
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,000
the president's own
Labor Department

418
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,720
says it's 81 cents.

419
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,760
SCOTT PELLEY: Another
Federal study, for example,

420
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,080
says the disparity is more
like 88 cents for every dollar.

421
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,360
The studies do show
that when you do

422
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,200
the controlling,
there's about a 9% gap.

423
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,760
MAN: The wage gap is really
somewhere between 5 and 7 cents.

424
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,720
Women who do not get married
have virtually no wage gap.

425
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,680
They earn 96 cents
for every dollar a man makes.

426
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,120
Look, look, even if
96 cents is the number,

427
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,600
which it isn't,
it's still terrible.

428
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,280
Let me put this in terms
that are, perhaps,

429
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,880
easier to understand.

430
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,000
If someone takes
a dump on my desk,

431
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,920
the size of the dump
is not the issue.

432
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,360
I'm not gonna say,
"Well, how big of a dump is it?

433
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,040
"8 inches? 10 inches?

434
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,720
"Oh, just 3 inches?

435
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,440
"Well, that's almost like
you didn't take a dump

436
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,200
on my desk at all."

437
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,280
And this--

438
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,840
And so this is where
we are right now.

439
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,840
The one equal-pay act
in Congress

440
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,000
has already been killed,

441
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,120
and there is seemingly nothing
on the horizon,

442
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,440
but to listen to some,
that's not a problem

443
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,040
because not only does
the gap barely exist,

444
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,120
if it does,
it's actually women's fault.

445
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,360
Women make
different choices

446
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,840
about what kinds
of jobs they seek,

447
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,440
they make
different choices

448
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,320
in reaction to marriage
and childbirth.

449
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,840
When those things,
those factors are taken

450
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,880
into consideration,
studies have indicated

451
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,600
that the pay gap all
but evaporates.

452
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,960
Classic.

453
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,880
Women are paid less because
they choose to have children,

454
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,120
although, to be fair,
they didn't

455
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,440
technically choose
to be the sole gender

456
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,040
biologically capable
of pregnancy

457
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,680
with the notable exception,
of course, of seahorses

458
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,440
and Arnold Schwarzenegger
in "Junior," so that--

459
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,600
just let's be
balanced here.

460
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,800
The second popular argument
for why the wage gap

461
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,800
is women's fault
is that they choose

462
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,360
to enter lower-paying
professions.

463
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,080
When you compare
men and women

464
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,320
in the same positions
and with the same experience,

465
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,760
the same education,
there is no pay gap.

466
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,840
You need to look at,
yes, what the position is

467
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,840
and you need to compare
apples to apples,

468
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,080
not pick and choose.

469
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,680
OK, apples to apples.

470
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,520
OK, well, in which case,
I actually have

471
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,800
a question for you.

472
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,960
How do you like
these apples?

473
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,240
A recent study out
of Yale University

474
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,680
that is interesting,
where professors were

475
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,240
given the identical
resume--

476
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,520
one had the name John
on the top,

477
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,480
and one had the name
Jennifer on top--

478
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,960
and the male candidate

479
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
was rated
more favorably...

480
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,520
Really?

481
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,600
and they were offered,
on average, $4,000 more

482
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,440
than the female
candidate.

483
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,040
OK, OK, so it seems we
either address the root

484
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,240
of this problem
and fight entrenched sexism

485
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,360
in our society,

486
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,680
or all women simply change
their names to John.

487
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,360
Sure, it'll be
confusing for a while,

488
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,960
but you'll have $4,000 extra
a year just to take

489
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,240
the edge off the confusion.

490
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,720
And also, don't
despair just yet

491
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,400
because apparently,
if women can just hang in there,

492
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,960
there is hope.

493
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,520
If you're unmarried
and childless,

494
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,240
between the ages
of 35 and 43,

495
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,600
the statistics show
you make $1.08

496
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,760
on average to every
male dollar.

497
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,000
So there you
have it, ladies.

498
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,520
If you can just
remain single,

499
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,160
not accidentally
have children,

500
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,520
and never turn 44,
you're gonna be golden.

501
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,120
Look, here's the thing.

502
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,040
Paying people less
for the same work

503
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,400
is clearly wrong.

504
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,080
Even monkeys know that.

505
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,240
Scientists actually ran a test where two monkeys

506
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,960
performed exactly
the same task.

507
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,600
One was paid with a grape
and the other

508
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,000
with just a cucumber.

509
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,400
Watch how the monkey
who got the cucumber

510
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,960
reacted when it realized
it was underpaid.

511
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,360
"Hey, hey, calm
down, monkey!

512
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,520
"You don't know what
the other monkey's experience

513
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,840
"and education were.

514
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,560
"You've just made different
choices in your life.

515
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,600
Besides, a cucumber is
virtually the same as a grape."

516
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,760
Now, some people are
always going to want to

517
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,560
pay women less,
even if it is, let's say,

518
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,040
83 cents on the dollar.

519
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,240
But if we're not going
to get legislation,

520
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,800
it should at least
be obvious

521
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,680
who is choosing to do that.

522
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,600
So, to that end, we would
like to suggest this.

523
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,920
ANNOUNCER: Are you
a middle-aged man running

524
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,400
a financial firm

525
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,920
or a multinational conglomerate?

526
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,680
Do you find that
pushy female employees

527
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,840
have been nagging you
with unreasonable demands

528
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,480
for equal pay?

529
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,320
What if I told you
about a revolutionary

530
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,480
new product that lets you pay women just as much as men

531
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,800
without sacrificing
the sheer convenience

532
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,800
of paying them less?

533
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,440
Introducing Ladybucks,

534
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,240
dollars for female employees

535
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,440
that are worth just 83 cents
on the dollar.

536
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,920
Ladybucks is the new
currency for women

537
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,960
from the Federal Reserve

538
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,800
and the creators
of Playtex Gentle Glide 360.

539
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,920
Available in a variety
of colors and scents,

540
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,200
Ladybucks feature
America's most celebrated

541
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,920
female presidents,
like Geena Davis,

542
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,960
Julia Louis-Dreyfus,

543
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,480
and "Battlestar Galactica's"
Laura Roslin,

544
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,880
who only became president

545
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,080
after almost all
of mankind was destroyed.

546
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,200
It's an amount that
could be described as...

547
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,400
and...

548
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,680
So why not try Ladybucks?

549
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,560
Show the women in your
workplace that they're

550
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,680
truly 0.83 in a million.

551
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,360
Ladybucks are
not for everyone.

552
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,040
Consult your lawyer
before using Ladybucks.

553
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,520
Use of Ladybucks may
result in class-action lawsuits,

554
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,400
adverse publicity,
failure to retain staff,

555
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,760
or being kicked in the dick.

556
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,280
That's our show.

557
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,880
We're off
for the next two weeks.

558
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,160
We'll be back
the first week in September

559
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,440
with a new episode.

560
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,560
Thank you so much
for watching.

561
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,560
Have a great night!
