00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,680
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,000
EPISODE 7

3
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,080
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,680
Our guest: Stephen Hawking
is our actual guest this evening,

5
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,280
very exciting.

6
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,080
Before we begin, a couple of weeks ago,
we did a piece about net neutrality.

7
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,200
We pointed out that Tom Wheeler,
the chair of the FCC,

8
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,240
which is tasked
with regulating cable companies,

9
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,080
was previously a lobbyist
for the cable industry.

10
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,880
Something of a conflict of interest
that we summarized thusly...

11
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,360
That is the equivalent of needing
a babysitter and hiring a dingo.

12
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,840
It's a little offensive to Australia's
favorite baby-eating animal,

13
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,520
but needs must for the joke.

14
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,760
You're probably wondering
why I'm playing it again now.

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,640
On Friday, the FCC held
an open meeting, and this happened !

16
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,280
You watched the John Oliver segment ?
What you thought about it ?

17
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,520
Shit !

18
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,320
That is not good.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,880
So... What did he think ?

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,520
I think that it represents the...

21
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,600
high level of interest that exists
in the topic in the country,

22
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,480
and that's good.

23
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:10,280
I would like to state
for the record I'm not a dingo.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,840
First...

25
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,520
And second:
We never said you "were" a dingo.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,360
We said you were "like" a dingo.
But you're denying it so strenuously,

27
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,400
I'm honestly starting to wonder
whether you are actually a dingo.

28
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,480
He tried to throw us off his scent by
pretending not to know what a dingo is.

29
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,240
I had to go look it up.
It's a feral wild animal in Australia.

30
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,840
That's exactly the kind of thing
a dingo would say

31
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,080
if he didn't want anyone
to know he was a dingo.

32
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,120
Look at a split screen !

33
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,200
The likeness is uncanny.

34
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,240
If you shaved the one on the left,

35
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,040
would it not look
like the guy on the right ?

36
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,480
Because now I have
lots more questions Wheeler.

37
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,800
"Have you, at any time ever consumed
a swamp wallaby for its nutrients ?"

38
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,880
You probably have,
you fucking dingo.

39
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,480
- What's your answer to that ?
- I'm not a dingo.

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,840
You keep saying that,
but now the burden of proof is on you !

41
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,880
Unless you can produce a document,
verified by a licensed zoologist,

42
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,720
certifying that you are in fact,
not a 100 percent talking dingo,

43
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,760
I don't think you can complain

44
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,520
if Americans refuse to leave you
alone in rooms with their babies.

45
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,000
Because you'd eat them.
You filthy dingo !

46
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,960
Moving on to something
unfortunately far more serious:

47
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,880
it has been a terrible week in Iraq,
even by Iraq's terrible standards.

48
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,040
Fighters under black flags
have marched south through Iraq,

49
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,520
the cities have fallen one by one.

50
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,840
From Mosul in the north to
Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit.

51
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,440
More than 200 miles
in a matter of days.

52
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,400
They started on Tuesday and were
just outside Baghdad five days later.

53
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,800
They took over a portion of Iraq

54
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,680
as quickly as Amazon can give you
complimentary ground shipping.

55
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,080
The group currently overrunning Iraq
call themselves ISIS,

56
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,680
or "the Islamic State
of Iraq and Syria",

57
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,400
although they should probably
be known now as "Turbo Al Qaeda."

58
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,200
Because they didn't take over much
of northern Iraq this week.

59
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,920
They went "Ocean's 11" on it.

60
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,320
The militants are flush with cash.
They robbed Mosul's central bank,

61
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,600
taking over $400 million,
according to the city's governor.

62
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,840
It makes them arguably the richest
terrorist group in the world.

63
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,200
Wait, you made $400 million
and exploited half a country in a week ?

64
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,040
What are you,
a terrorist group or a hedge fund ?

65
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,760
Of all the chilling details
that came out about ISIS this week,

66
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,000
this one was perhaps the worst...

67
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,480
ISIS formed in April last year
growing out of Al Qaeda

68
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,280
but it is so extreme that Al Qaeda
has now disavowed them.

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,760
How crazy
do you have to be for Al Qaeda

70
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,760
to distance themselves from you ?

71
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,640
That's like Liam Neeson saying

72
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,360
"You're going a little overboard
trying to save your daughter.

73
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,560
Have you thought about going to the
embassy ? Official channels are best."

74
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,280
And finally this week
the president made a long overdue trip.

75
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,240
President Obama focused on the
struggles of Native Americans today.

76
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,360
He made a visit to the
Standing Rock Sioux Reservation.

77
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,760
With his visit today, he becomes
only the fourth sitting president ever

78
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,120
to visit an Indian reservation.

79
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,280
That is pretty amazing. Only the fourth
sitting president to visit "ever".

80
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,840
Technically, if you count
"non"-sitting presidents

81
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,040
then Andrew Jackson
did visit "lot".

82
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,040
You shouldn't count that. He did visit
but you shouldn't count it.

83
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,360
The U.S. department
of housing and urban development

84
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,480
announced they'd be making
70 million available

85
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,640
to improve tribal housing conditions,
including money for mold removal.

86
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,440
To which the Native Americans
presumably said:

87
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,520
"Finally !
We are officially square.

88
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,120
Look, it was touch-and-go
for a few centuries there,

89
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,720
but at the end of the day,
all we wanted was our mold removed."

90
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,680
There is one other thing the Native
Americans wouldn't mind if we did.

91
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,640
And it concerns the football team
for some reason

92
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,000
not-yet-formally-known
-as-the-Washington-Redskins.

93
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,200
They still haven't changed their name
despite the launch, just this week,

94
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,320
of a new emotionally-powerful
advertising campaign.

95
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,280
Seminole. Seneca. Mohawk.

96
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,640
And Creek. Mills.

97
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,840
Will Rodgers. Geronimo.

98
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,520
Unyielding. Strong. Indomitable.

99
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,640
Native Americans
call themselves many things.

100
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,720
The one thing they don't.

101
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,160
For the average American,
that ad should tug

102
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,680
at one sixteenth of your heartstrings
and made the rest feel extremely guilty.

103
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,520
The strongest possible pushback
you can have

104
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,360
after watching
something amazing like that is...

105
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,920
Yeah but...
You're right., you're right.

106
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,360
We've got to change the name,
you're right.

107
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,880
But one person remains unmoved,

108
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,880
and unfortunately,
he's the only one that matters.

109
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,920
Redskins owner Dan Snyder
has held firm

110
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,120
that he will not change
the nickname of his team.

111
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,760
Washington Redskins
is more than a name

112
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,920
we have called our football team
for over eight decades.

113
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,320
It is a symbol
of everything we stand for:

114
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,160
strength, courage,
pride and respect.

115
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,040
I had no idea you have an ancient
eight decade history at stake here.

116
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,440
You are clearly proud people
who have suffered greatly.

117
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,560
Please accept my apologies,
oh chief runs without moral compass.

118
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,880
It's getting increasingly hard

119
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,000
to make a good argument for keeping
the Washington Redskins' name.

120
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,800
If only there were some emotionally
affecting way to convey that.

121
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,560
There are many positions
that can be defended.

122
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,560
Steven Tyler's still got it.

123
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,560
Cauliflower is the king
of vegetables.

124
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,360
Camping is actually fun.

125
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,680
Music you never tire of ?
Mariachi.

126
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,440
Weasels make the cutest pets.

127
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,280
You should leave
that fourth voicemail.

128
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,200
Every flight needs more babies.

129
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,920
If you don't learn to play
the recorder, you're fucked.

130
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,320
Philadelphia is the cultural capital
of America.

131
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,320
If you want to get laid,
become a magician.

132
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,480
Nancy Grace seems nice.

133
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,680
But the one position
that can't be defended...

134
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,520
Is this...

135
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,200
Seriously though,

136
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,400
playing a recorder sets you
up for life, seriously.

137
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,360
Now, moving on, I'd like to talk
about immigration tonight.

138
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,640
Now, clearly, I have
a vested interest in the subject.

139
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,680
Eight years ago, I journeyed
to American from across the sea,

140
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,160
like a human Fievel.

141
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,880
"Somewhere out there,

142
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,520
beneath the pale moonlight..."

143
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,760
Immigration has always been part
of the American story.

144
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,480
And it has definitely been part
of the American story this week.

145
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,360
House majority leader Eric Cantor
going down to defeat

146
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,480
to an unknown economics professor,
Dave Brat.

147
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,560
The big issue was immigration.

148
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,840
Brat told republican voters in
Virginia's conservative 7th district,

149
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,680
that Cantor would support
president Obama on immigration reform.

150
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,120
This means immigration reform
is 100% dead.

151
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,440
Immigration reform, probably dead
for the rest of the Obama presidency.

152
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,400
- Immigration reform is dead.
- Dead as a doornail.

153
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,920
So, let's break this down,
immigration reform

154
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,920
one of the most important issues
facing America

155
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
has been door nailed by 65 000
republican primary voters

156
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,560
who could be bothered
to turn up on a Tuesday,

157
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,680
500 miles
from the nearest border.

158
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,200
The system works !

159
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,760
Immigration reform
was already dead.

160
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,960
It's just that Congress
had put a hat and sunglasses on it

161
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,520
and propped it up
hoping no one would notice.

162
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,960
Which is a real shame. If you've been
watching the news this week,

163
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,240
you may have seen the evidence of how
badly our immigration system is broken.

164
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,480
Not just the heartbreaking photos
of hundreds of children

165
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,280
being held in detention facilities
in Arizona, but also this...

166
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,240
Here's the issue, if you want to go
from let's say El Salvador to right here,

167
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,800
to Mission, Texas, if you want to go
with the V.I.P. Coyote,

168
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,120
the guys that bring you in illegally,
it's going to cost you about $9,000.

169
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,520
If you do it on the cheap,
it's going to cost you about $2,500.

170
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,040
If you want to cross the border
right here on the river behind me

171
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,720
on a jet ski, that's going to cost you
an additional $500, or $600.

172
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,920
That is a weird tone of voice
to be using.

173
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,240
Is that guy delivering
a news report or an infomercial ?

174
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,080
"Call the number on the bottom
of your screen,

175
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,440
and you won't just get the jet ski ride
and the coyote access,

176
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,120
you'll get a counterfeit
social security card.

177
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,040
And, for some reason,
a Thighmaster. Call now !"

178
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,000
I will say, though,
I think most people would agree,

179
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,880
anyone who manages to immigrate
into America on a jet ski

180
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,760
probably belongs here.

181
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,440
That's a universal truth.

182
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,120
But the immigration issue
always provokes a strong response.

183
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,320
And that's not an American trait.
That is true the world over.

184
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,040
The French want to preserve their
way of life, and don't want to adopt

185
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,520
the cultures, traditions,
and customs of these foreigners.

186
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,080
We are fighting for a Dutch society
without immigrants.

187
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,640
Bulgaria is constructing
a 30 kilometer wall

188
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,280
along part of its border
with Turkey.

189
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,720
When those Romanians or Bulgarians
here, you're going to have a problem.

190
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,120
You haven't seen crime
yet but you will.

191
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,880
That last one honestly
makes me so homesick.

192
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,240
That's the music of my youth.

193
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,160
I lost my virginity to the sound
of a man ranting about Bulgarians.

194
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,760
So, basically, immigration
is the universal crazy-maker.

195
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,320
And believe me, I know,
I come from England.

196
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,800
Hating immigrants
is one of our national pastimes,

197
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,960
it's like cricket
or winning Academy Awards.

198
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,240
We're almost weirdly good at it.
And we've been doing it for years.

199
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,840
Of course, there are far too many
immigrants in this country.

200
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,280
When will the public wake up
to the fact that you cannot

201
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,240
put a quart into a pint bottle ?

202
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,160
My wife and I used to like to go out
weekends down to the local,

203
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,880
have a couple of drinks,
meet friends in there.

204
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,320
We can't go into the locals anymore,
they're full up with noisy foreigners.

205
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,600
After going through two world wars
we should at least have the dignity

206
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,040
of being allowed
to live with our own kind.

207
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,640
That lady missed some key lessons
from those world wars.

208
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,240
The Nazis must be defeated

209
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,600
so we can create an England
pure of race and genetically superior !

210
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,880
At least, but look...

211
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,840
At least, England has an excuse
for being that stupid:

212
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,600
It's just too old.

213
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,240
Americans don't have that excuse,
you're young enough

214
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,760
you can actually dress up like your
earliest ancestors in the country.

215
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,480
If you asked
an English person to do that,

216
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,080
they'd show up confused
wearing a cloak and deer antlers,

217
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,720
and waving a wand around.

218
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,120
"Is this it ? Merlin went
through a wardrobe. Is this it ?"

219
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,880
Immigrants have been good
to America.

220
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,880
They've created
some of your most American things:

221
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,600
"God bless America ?"
Written by a Siberian.

222
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,680
Levis jeans ? A Bavarian.

223
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,320
The White House ?
Designed by an Irishman.

224
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,480
Superman ? A Kryptonian.

225
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,480
Who was co-created by a Canadian.

226
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,440
And in return,
America has been good for immigrants.

227
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,680
Sure, yeah,
people shouldn't come here illegally.

228
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,200
But can you blame them ?
It's great here.

229
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,800
You guys, yes,
you guys have done...

230
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,920
It's awesome,

231
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,680
and you guys have done an amazing job
of branding yourselves !

232
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,880
This is the land of Captain America !
The Mall of America !

233
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,120
American Girl Dolls !
The American Pie movies !

234
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,800
You took the most iconic foodstuff and
monetized a movie about fucking it !

235
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,200
Is it any wonder people
want to live here ?

236
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,120
I did !
And it's worked out great !

237
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,320
So, if America's good for immigrants,
and vice-versa,

238
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,600
why do some people want
to clamp down on immigration ?

239
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,880
Let's start by asking the man who
pushed the issue to the fore this week,

240
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,200
Eric Cantor's vanquisher, Dave Brat.

241
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,800
We clearly cannot import
7 billion people on the planet

242
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,200
into the United States of America.
It's just a non-starter.

243
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,720
Yeah ,except no one's saying
we should import 7 billion people.

244
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,120
Congratulations Dave !
You constructed a straw man so large,

245
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,160
you could burn it in the desert and
hold an annoying festival around it.

246
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,440
That's the problem
with the immigration debate right now.

247
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,120
Those like me, and most Americans

248
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,880
who would like
some kind of immigration reform

249
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,080
have our voices drowned out by...

250
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,400
And look, this is going
to sound a little bit prejudiced,

251
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,680
but drowned out by a lot of opinions
unsupported by documentation.

252
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,320
Let's call them
undocumented opinions.

253
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,120
They flooded all over this country,
threatening the American way of life.

254
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,280
If only we could build some barrier
to protect ourselves from them !

255
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,880
A fence, if you will, of facts.

256
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,280
Let's try. Here comes one of those
undocumented opinions rights now.

257
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,200
You are bringing in workers to take
jobs from unemployed Americans.

258
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,400
That's a classic. Undocumented workers
take American jobs.

259
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:22,000
The problem is that it's not true,
but it feels like it might be.

260
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,360
Like "bears only have sex
face-to-face." Or...

261
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,640
Or...

262
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,400
Or, "every vagina starts closed,
and doctors open it."

263
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,840
"The difference between peanut butter
and mustard is the amount of salt."

264
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,440
Multiple sources,

265
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,200
including the Conservative
American Enterprise Institute,

266
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,000
have said there's no evidence of
emigrants hurting US employment.

267
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,240
Just as there is no evidence
that bears only have sex face to face.

268
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,120
They only do it sometimes,
on anniversaries.

269
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,760
Okay, so...

270
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,200
Look at me ! Happy Birthday !

271
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,680
Okay, so what's another
undocumented opinion

272
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,520
that needs to be stopped
from entering people's ears illegally ?

273
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,440
For every one whose a valedictorian,
there's another hundred out there

274
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,360
that weigh 130 pounds and they got
calves the size of cantaloupes

275
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,560
because they're hauling 75 lbs
of marijuana across the desert.

276
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,400
What ? What did you just say ?
Calves the size of cantaloupes ?

277
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,520
That is magnificent.

278
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,840
Put aside there are countless studies
that debunk the notion that immigrants

279
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,000
are especially prone to crime at all.

280
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,400
Relish for a moment how he poetically
presented that bigoted bullshit.

281
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,000
Cantaloupe-calved,
they did burrow through the border,

282
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,400
their arms moist and sinewy,
like ropes upon a ship's mast.

283
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,520
I might hate what you're saying,
but I sure do love the way you say it.

284
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,160
But, but even if you can stop
the undocumented arguments

285
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,360
that when immigrants
aren't stealing American jobs,

286
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,960
they're acting
as melon-esque drug mules,

287
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,320
there is one argument
that always seems to get through...

288
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,920
This is President Obama's number one
political agenda item

289
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,160
because he knows we will never
again have a Republican president.

290
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,520
Ever, if amnesty goes into effect.

291
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,120
Right, okay.

292
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,680
So, the argument is
we can't let the immigrants in,

293
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,760
because they'll never vote for us.

294
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,680
To which, I might have a solution:

295
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,360
what if, and is going to sound crazy,
you just tried treating them better ?

296
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,080
I don't want to push you
outside your comfort zone,

297
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,000
maybe even
as if they're human beings

298
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,680
who might have something
hypothetically to offer the country ?

299
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,600
I've been through
the immigration process

300
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,680
under the best possible scenario,
and it was still hell.

301
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,360
At this point, the poem
in the base of the statue of liberty

302
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,560
"give me your tired, your poor,
your huddled masses"

303
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,360
is starting to constitute
false advertising.

304
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,640
I would say
the FCC should get involved.

305
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,160
But they're currently run
by a human dingo.

306
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,880
I am not a dingo.

307
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,080
Prove it ! That's on you.

308
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:39,080
Here's the thing, I was ten when
I first saw "An American Tail".

309
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,520
And I thought, "yes !
That looks delightful !

310
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,200
Sure, there's a mildly unpleasant
boat ride at the beginning,

311
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,240
but after that, you get
to take a flight around New York

312
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,280
on an inexplicably
French pigeon.

313
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,200
But to the modern immigrant,
that film is now a lie.

314
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,840
A lie told by a friendly rodent.

315
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,640
So, if we can't update
our immigration policy,

316
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,760
at the very least,
we need to update that movie

317
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,280
to reflect what the current immigrant
experience is actually like.

318
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:15,320
In 2014, a little mouse made
a big journey to a far-a-way land.

319
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,160
America ! What a place !

320
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,880
It's "An Actual American Tail" !

321
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,560
'Att'l be five hundred fer you
and yer whore sister.

322
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,200
But sir, my sister...
Asphyxiated a few days ago.

323
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,640
That right ? 'Att'l be another 100
to ditch the corpse, then.

324
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,720
Human right's critics call
"An Actual American Tail"

325
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,720
"absolutely appalling"
and "a dehumanizing mess

326
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,200
that will make you
question why you wanted

327
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,840
to subject yourself
to the experience."

328
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,800
You've never seen America 'till
you've seen it through Fievel's eyes.

329
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,560
These mice come over here,
they take our jobs and our cheese.

330
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,640
And what do we get in return ?
Nothing ! I'm sick of it !

331
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,960
They need to go back !

332
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,440
What happens when Fievel's forced
to take a job at a mousetrap factory ?

333
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,680
I'm gonna dedut the cost of that trap
from your pay, you piece of shit !

334
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,800
Discover what you do when you can't
risk going to the emergency room !

335
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,880
And coming next year,
watch what happens when Fievel

336
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,040
tucks his severed tail between his legs
and attempts to come back legally

337
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,720
in "An Actual American Tail:
Fieval goes INS."

338
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,160
I'll go home
and come back the right way !

339
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,000
Featuring nine solid hours of Fievel

340
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,480
being gradually crushed
by a broken system

341
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,560
hamstrung by the lack
of any political will for reform.

342
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,960
With endless waiting livened up by
the occasional mandatory blood test !

343
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,560
Watch as Fievel fills out forms,
calls the attorney he can't afford,

344
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,800
and lives in a state of constant panic
that his application will be denied

345
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,440
for reasons such as social
affiliations, tenuous health,

346
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,560
losing his employer-based sponsor
because they don't need him anymore,

347
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,160
or a bureaucratic slip-up.

348
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,000
Yes, next summer,

349
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,120
bring the family and watch
the heartwarming tale of Fievel

350
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,280
becoming both inmate and executioner
in a prison of his own mind.

351
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,560
You can do it Fievel !

352
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,920
It's going to be impossibly hard.

353
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,600
And now this...

354
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,960
Across the broad expanse of history,

355
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,000
there have been billions
upon billions of idiots.

356
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,760
As well as a handful
of smart people.

357
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,880
We interviewed some of the latter
group for our on-going series,

358
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,000
"Great Minds:
People Who Think Good."

359
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,520
This weeks people who thinks good
Stephen Hawking.

360
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,720
Professor Stephen Hawking
is a pioneering physicist,

361
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,040
international best-selling author,

362
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,760
and a popular guest character
on The Simpsons.

363
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,240
If you are looking
for trouble you found it.

364
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,200
Yeah, just try me, you...

365
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,000
His breakthrough work
on black holes and string-theory

366
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,720
is considered hugely important, by
anyone who pretends to understand it.

367
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,000
An expanding universe
does not preclude a creator.

368
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,280
I traveled to the Department
of Applied Mathematics

369
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,120
and Theoretical Physics
at Cambridge University

370
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,560
to speak with one of the world's
greatest living minds.

371
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,960
First off, congratulations
on being the first subject

372
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,960
of our "Great Minds" series.

373
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,000
Is this the single greatest honor
you have ever received ?

374
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,640
- Yes.
- Good.

375
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,360
It's a little hard
to read your tone of your voice.

376
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,960
When you say that,
are you being sarcastic ?

377
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,000
- Yes.
- I thought so.

378
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,440
If there is one thing you want people
to understand about your work

379
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,200
bearing in mind that most people
will never understand anything,

380
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,720
what would that thing be ?

381
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,440
Imaginary time. People think
it's something you have in dreams.

382
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,120
Or when you're up against
a deadline.

383
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,760
But it's a well-defined concept.

384
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,200
Imaginary time is like
another direction in space.

385
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,600
It's the one bit of my work
science fiction writers haven't used.

386
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,920
- Because they don't' understand it.
- Idiots.

387
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,360
People are such idiots,
'cause presumably to my mind,

388
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,680
you're talking about the theoretical
measurement attained from real-time

389
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,120
by a wink rotation of pi
divided by two in a complex plain

390
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,280
where T equals I times T.

391
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,920
It's not that difficult.

392
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,320
Let's talk
about artificial intelligence.

393
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,040
In a recent op-ed column
you said, and I quote,

394
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,040
"Success in creating
artificial intelligence

395
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,760
would be the biggest event
in human history.

396
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,680
Unfortunately,
it might also be the last."

397
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,200
Are you saying, that robots
are going to destroy humanity ?

398
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,400
And is that a scientific argument,
or the pitch for an amazing movie ?

399
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,080
Artificial intelligence could be a
danger in the not-too-distant future.

400
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,720
It could design improvements to itself.
And out-smart us all.

401
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,840
I know you're trying to get people
to be cautious there,

402
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,440
but why should I not be excited
about fighting a robot ?

403
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,840
You would lose.

404
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,360
We don't know that do we ?

405
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,400
We don't know that for sure.
'Cause what could a robot do

406
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,080
that I couldn't then fight back
by simply just unplugging him ?

407
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,240
There's a story that scientists built
an intelligent computer,

408
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,520
the first question that asked it,
"Is there a God ?"

409
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,840
The computer replied,
"There is now."

410
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,920
A bolt of lightning struck the plug,
so it couldn't be turned off.

411
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,800
That is the most terrifying
story I have ever heard.

412
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,280
- Yes.
- Hold on...

413
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,360
Who is talking to me right now ?

414
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,640
Is it you, or the sentient computer
pretending to talk on your behalf ?

415
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,560
- It's me.
- But how do I know that ?

416
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,320
Because if computers
had become sentient,

417
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,120
what better way
to convince people they hadn't,

418
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,120
than by co-opting the voice of the
most intelligent man on the planet ?

419
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,800
You're an idiot.

420
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,160
Who's saying that, Stephen,
you or the machine ?

421
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,880
- Both of us.
- Okay. Alright.

422
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,200
That's quite reassuring.

423
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,880
You've stated that you believe,

424
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,360
there could be an infinite number
of parallel universes.

425
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,920
Does that mean that there is a universe
out there where I am smarter than you ?

426
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,600
Yes, and also a universe
where you're funny.

427
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:46,760
Okay, look, if you're so smart,
what number am I think of...

428
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,200
- 13.
- It was 13.

429
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,760
I was thinking of 13.

430
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,480
Okay, that was a lucky guess.
What am I thinking right now ?

431
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,080
That you've been a huge
disappointment to your family.

432
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,520
I wasn't thinking that.
Why would I think that ?

433
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,760
You know I'm trying
as hard as I can.

434
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,880
Why is that so hard for them
to understand ? Hypothetically.

435
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,840
Are the following things
technically possible ?

436
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,240
Life on other planets ?
Is that theoretically possible ?

437
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,560
Yes.

438
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,760
- A Schwartzchild wormhole ?
- Yes.

439
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,840
What about this, me going on a date
with Charlize Theron ?

440
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,520
- No.
- No ? Not at all, in no universe ?

441
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,000
No.

442
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,120
In none of the infinite universes
does that happen ?

443
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,280
No.

444
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,440
It's completely beyond the bounds
of scientific possibility ?

445
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,640
Yes.

446
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,200
Quick follow-up question:
in any of those potential universes,

447
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,600
am I the one rejecting her,
and that's why it doesn't work out ?

448
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:58,640
No. You do realize that typing
a response is difficult for me ?

449
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,360
Sure, yeah.
It's just that I'm trying to play this out.

450
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,400
I'm trying to see
if there is any hypothetical...

451
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,760
It doesn't matter.
But, never say never.

452
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,920
If time travel were possible,

453
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,600
would you want to go back in time
and refuse to do this interview ?

454
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,360
Yes.

455
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,680
You truly are,
an incredibly smart man.

456
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,360
Stephen Hawking,
thank you so much for your time.

457
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,760
Thanks so much for watching.

458
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,120
You can watch an extended interview
with Stephen Hawking, here...

459
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,240
Thank you very much !
Have a good week !

460
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,760
END OF EPISODE 7
