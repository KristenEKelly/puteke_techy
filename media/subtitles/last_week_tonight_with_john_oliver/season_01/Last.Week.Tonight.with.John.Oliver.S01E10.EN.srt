1
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,360
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight."

2
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,360
I'm John Oliver.

3
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,840
Thank you for being with us.

4
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,840
Let's start this evening with a quick recap of the week,

5
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,280
beginning with Japan, Earth's pervert uncle, which this week

6
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,240
announced a major policy shift.

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,000
And in Japan, the government has changed its

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,200
pacifist military policy for the first time in more

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,440
than 70 years.

10
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,040
It will now be able to use military force to defend

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,640
other nations.

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,200
Wow. That is a major shift, but I think the bigger news

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,280
here is that apparently Japan
has had a policy of pacifism

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,840
for nearly 70 years.

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,920
Certainly all the repressed
anger in their cartoons makes

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,920
a lot more sense.

17
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,280
"Oh, OK. We still
can't fight any wars?

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,760
"Fine. Here's another
cartoon of a schoolgirl

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,920
covered in blood."

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,080
In fact, many Japanese
citizens were extremely angry

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,280
about this policy shift,
taking to the streets

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,880
in protest, waving signs
depicting their

23
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,640
prime minister as Hitler.

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,840
And I'll tell you who I
feel sorry for there--Tojo.

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,880
He must have been going,
"Oh, come on!

26
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,600
"You needed a mustachioed
World War II war criminal

27
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,600
"at a Japanese protest,
and you go with Adolf?

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,960
"I attacked Pearl Harbor!

29
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,960
"What do I have to do to be
a shorthand for evil?

30
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,360
It's not fair!
I earned it!"

31
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,280
In this atmosphere, the
Japanese military may struggle

32
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,880
to attract recruits, were
it not for a secret weapon:

33
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,600
a recruitment video featuring
one of the members

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,840
of the Japanese
pop group AKB48.

35
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,160
And by the way, a fun fact
about AKB48: they have over

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,840
100 members.

37
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,800
There is the cute one,
the quiet one, the funny one,

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,440
the smart one, the 16 giggly
ones, the 2 comatose ones,

39
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,880
the glass-eye one, the one no
one likes, the 23 sassy ones,

40
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,160
and the 62-year-old man posing
as a 19-year-old girl one.

41
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,800
He's my favorite.
He's my favorite.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,560
And before you make fun
of this probably not being

43
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,720
effective, just wait
until you see how catchy

44
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,000
their songs are.

45
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,960
Catchy.
That's a catchy song.

46
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,240
Whoo!

47
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,640
That is a catchy song.

48
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,160
In domestic news, there was
big news from American history

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,640
this week, specifically about
Warren G. Harding, America's

50
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,880
29th president, whose greatest
achievement was dying

51
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,960
two years
into his first term.

52
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,200
Let's be honest.

53
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,560
No one knows much about
Warren G. Harding,

54
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,920
but this week, that may
have permanently changed.

55
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,960
We're getting a first look at

56
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,120
some of the love letters that

57
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,640
President Warren G. Harding

58
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,960
wrote to his mistress

59
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,440
a century ago.

60
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,920
DIFFERENT NEWSMAN: Page after
page of Harding's handwriting

61
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,000
describe in detail what he
described as his

62
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,400
"eager, passion-wild, jealous
reverent, wistful love"

63
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,800
for his neighbor's wife.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,800
OK, OK, that's actually
a little misleading

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
because believe me, these
are not eager, jealous,

66
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,720
and wistful love letters.

67
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,840
This are smutty fucknotes so
raunchy a 40-year-old mother

68
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,680
of two should be reading them
on her Kindle because this is

69
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,000
an actual passage from
his actual letters.

70
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,600
Ahem.

71
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,400
"I feel that there will never
be any relief until I take

72
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,520
"a long, deep, wild draught on your lips and then bury my

73
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,880
face on your
pillowing breasts."

74
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,800
"Wouldn't you like to
get sopping wet out

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,120
"on Superior--not the lake--

76
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,200
"for the joy
of fevered fondling

77
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,000
and melting kisses?"

78
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:20,160
I've got to say, "Damn,
Warren, you nasty!"

79
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,920
No one--no one is gonna
be able to look at you

80
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,160
in the same way, Harding.

81
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,120
Before, all I could see
when I looked at you were your

82
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,880
eyebrows like mozzarella
sticks covered in pubic hair

83
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,240
and jowls like sour cream
funneled into a condom,

84
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,960
but now history will only
remember you and your

85
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,840
lake-based erotic poetry.

86
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,920
Well, actually, they will
remember one more thing.

87
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,400
NEWSMAN: We're also told that
just as Anthony Weiner goes by

88
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,640
Carlos Danger, Warren Harding
had a nickname for a certain

89
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,760
part of his anatomy.

90
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,640
He called it Jerry.

91
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,200
Yes.

92
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,080
Warren G. Harding, America's
29th president,

93
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,360
called his dick "Jerry,"

94
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,680
which is actually
funny because Gerald Ford

95
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,000
called his dick
Warren G. Harding,

96
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,760
but that's not the point.

97
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,800
I actually believe we have
an artist's rendering of Jerry.

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,800
That's what he
looked like back then.

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,960
It was a different time.

100
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,400
Harding actually writes about
Jerry in his letters, saying,

101
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,320
and again, I quote,
"You recall Jerry...

102
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,920
"He told me to say that you are
the best and the darlingest

103
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,480
"in the world, and if he could
have but one wish, it would be

104
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,920
"to be held in your darling
embrace and be thrilled by

105
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,280
your pink lips..."

106
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,440
I will say this--I will say
this for Warren Harding:

107
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,880
as a president, he was terrible,
but as an R&B lyricist, he was

108
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,520
way ahead of his time.

109
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,440
He really puts the Warren G.
into Warren G. Harding.

110
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,560
But finally this week, news
of our current president, who

111
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,600
previously announced that this
summer, he was gonna be going

112
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,480
on a bit of a tour.

113
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,160
President Obama's breaking out
of the Washington bubble is

114
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,120
all part of what
the White House is calling

115
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,240
A Day in the Life Tour, where
the president will spend part

116
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,440
of the summer getting to, as
I was saying, know regular

117
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,320
Americans across the country.

118
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,040
OK, getting to know us
is overstating it.

119
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,720
He's not gonna sit down with
us with a tub of ice cream

120
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,880
and two spoons going,
"Well, I don't know, Deborah.

121
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,080
"Maybe you should go back to
school, but remember, what you

122
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,760
do isn't who you are, Debs."

123
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,840
But OK, sure, sure.

124
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,440
He wants to meet
us regular folks.

125
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,680
Fine. First stop in
the Day of the Life Tour

126
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,800
this week was Denver.

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,040
NEWSWOMAN: He shook hands with
dozens lining the sidewalk.

128
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,680
He even ran into someone who
for some unknown reason was

129
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,880
wearing a horse head mask.

130
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,960
How did he get in?

131
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,640
I think my favorite thing
in that photo is the face

132
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,480
of the Secret Service guy.

133
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,920
That is a man who knows he
has got a tough conversation

134
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,840
with the president
in 5 minutes.

135
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,120
"Hey, Tony, how do you think
that meet-and-greet went?

136
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,000
"Because I'll tell you what I remember.

137
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,480
"That time the guy in
the horse's head lunged out

138
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,880
at me, and you stood there
admiring his fucking snout."

139
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,760
Look, let's be honest.

140
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,680
There is absolutely nothing
natural about politicians

141
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,160
meeting people in these
kind of circumstances.

142
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Listen to a woman who met
him in Texas the next day.

143
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,760
Security was everywhere, so
we had to make sure our hands

144
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,200
were out of our pockets,
and we had to be, like, very

145
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,920
sincere and, like, use our
correct grammar and niceness.

146
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,240
Oh, nice work, Secret Service.

147
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,040
So you can't protect
the president from a guy

148
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,280
in a horse's head, but you
can protect him from any

149
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,320
split infinitives.

150
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,840
But that's the key
problem with this whole

151
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,760
stupid exercise.

152
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,920
Nobody is having
an average day when

153
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,920
the president is there.

154
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
They're too busy keeping their
hands where people can see

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,200
them and using their
correct grammar and niceness.

156
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,800
Mr. President, if you really
want to know what a regular

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,800
day in the life of an average
American is, stay

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,840
in the White House
and watch this.

159
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,280
ANNOUNCER: Mr. President,
America is thrilled you want

160
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,560
to know what
our average days are like.

161
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,720
Here's the problem:
you're never going to see

162
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,880
an average day because
you're the president,

163
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,920
and when you turn up,
things get weird.

164
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,800
So let me show you what we're
up to when you're not around.

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,960
On our average days, Americans
are sitting on our couches,

166
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,800
dipping cheese sticks into
jars of marinara sauce,

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,960
even though we're
not really hungry.

168
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,560
We're looking for our toenail
clippers and, when we can't

169
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,080
find them, making do
with what's on hand.

170
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,920
We're at work staring at a bug
crawling across the window.

171
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,080
Where's he going?

172
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,400
What's his name?

173
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,280
Do bugs have names?

174
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,160
We're giving our children
a toy they want, as soon as we

175
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,600
can get it out of
the fucking box.

176
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,440
And we're masturbating.

177
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,880
So much masturbating.

178
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,160
And when we're not
masturbating, we're thinking

179
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,120
about masturbating.

180
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,880
Mr. President, you have
no idea how much

181
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,560
we're masturbating.

182
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,920
Seriously, you would be
genuinely angry if you knew

183
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,000
how much we were masturbating.

184
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,640
And the problem is, we
can't do any of this

185
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,480
when you show up.

186
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,440
So take a good
look, Mr. President.

187
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,640
These are the faces of Americans
when you're not around.

188
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,840
This is an average day
in our lives.

189
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,120
This is America, and you
don't want to know what we're

190
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,920
actually doing.

191
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,480
Moving on, moving on.

192
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,800
Our main story tonight
is income inequality.

193
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,160
A good way to figure out
which side of it you're on is

194
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,720
whether you're currently
paying for HBO or stealing it.

195
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,960
Last December--some of
you laughed a little too

196
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,880
hard at that.

197
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,760
Last December, the president
made it clear that income

198
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,760
inequality was going to
be a big priority.

199
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,800
The combined trends of
increased inequality

200
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,400
and decreasing mobility pose
a fundamental threat to

201
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,200
the American dream, our way
of life, and what we stand

202
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,520
for around the globe.

203
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,520
I believe this is the defining
challenge of our time.

204
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,520
Yes--the defining
challenge of our time.

205
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,360
Well, one of the two defining
challenges of our time,

206
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,440
the other being
Candy Crush level 97.

207
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,760
That is hard.

208
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,960
I've got a lollipop hammer,
and I still can't.

209
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,360
The point is that
the president said the word

210
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,280
"inequality" 26 times in that
speech, which everyone took to

211
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,120
mean one thing...

212
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,960
Income inequality is going
to be the thrust, one

213
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,680
of the major themes in 2016.

214
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,440
CHRIS MATTHEWS: Members of the
Senate Democratic leadership

215
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,840
team--that's Harry Reid
on down--are clearly going

216
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,880
after this income
inequality issue.

217
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,480
For Democrats, it's
an all-out assault

218
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,880
on the issue
of income inequality.

219
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,280
An all-out assault!

220
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,800
You better watch your
ass, income inequality,

221
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,680
because you're about to
get violently ameliorated.

222
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,600
Or you would have been
if they hadn't almost

223
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,920
immediately backed down.

224
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,840
NEWSWOMAN: A new article says
President Obama appears to be

225
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,600
shifting strategy on
tackling income inequality.

226
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,960
The "Washington Post"
reveals Democrats are split

227
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,280
on the issue, leaving
President Obama to shift talk

228
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,120
away from the subject.

229
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,680
So basically income inequality
has become just another topic

230
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,960
of conversation we prefer
to avoid in America, like

231
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,360
Japanese internment camps
or that time that we gave

232
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,160
Roberto Benigni
an Academy Award.

233
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,880
You know, national
tragedies, equally wrong.

234
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,640
There is a key reason why
no politician wants to talk

235
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,760
about it, and that's because
every time someone tries to,

236
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,960
this happens.

237
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,960
GRETA VAN SUSTEREN:
Is President Obama

238
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,240
engaging class warfare?

239
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,240
Class warfare.

240
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,400
Class warfare.

241
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,880
The politics
of class warfare.

242
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,800
Trying to drive
a class warfare argument.

243
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,960
Use that hashtag
#classwarfare.

244
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,520
OK, OK, that all sounds silly,

245
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,440
but the phrase
"class warfare" is

246
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,760
so toxic, the president
actually had to stop talking

247
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,640
about the thing he describes
as "a fundamental threat to

248
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,640
the American dream,"
and this was so predictable

249
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,000
that 3 years ago, he actually
gathered a group of historians

250
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,880
and told them, "What you could
do for me is to help find

251
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,600
"a way to discuss the issue
of inequality in our society

252
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,200
without being accused of
class warfare," to which they

253
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,960
presumably said, "Yeah,
we can't really help you

254
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,360
"with that, although
we can tell you what

255
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,520
"Warren G. Harding
named his penis.

256
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,960
It's not what
you're thinking!"

257
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,760
But just because politicians
can't talk about

258
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,240
income inequality doesn't mean
we shouldn't, and before we do,

259
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,720
let me just say no one
is arguing for complete,

260
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,240
perfect equality.

261
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,240
We are not going to live in
a world where we pretend that

262
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,240
all Baldwins are
equally talented.

263
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,400
I mean, look.

264
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,400
There's Billy,
and there's everyone else.

265
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,040
That's a fact.

266
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,840
Inequality is
a bit like cinnamon.

267
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,560
You definitely want to have
a little of it to spice life up

268
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,120
a bit, but too much of it
can be very dangerous.

269
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,960
And make no mistake--we are
at cinnamon-dangerous levels

270
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,760
right now.

271
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,960
The wealth gap
is getting worse.

272
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,760
A new analysis shows the
richest Americans, the top 1%,

273
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,880
made nearly 20% of all the available income

274
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,920
in America last year.

275
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,320
That's the widest income gap
since the Roaring Twenties.

276
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,560
Ho ho ho!

277
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,920
OK. Nothing
ominous there, then.

278
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,280
The Roaring Twenties were
famously the party that

279
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,320
never ended.

280
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,440
That's what made the thirties
so great--just more twenties.

281
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,160
And the thing is,
income inequality

282
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,800
affects everyone.

283
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,640
It can actually
hinder overall growth.

284
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,760
And just to be clear,
income inequality is by no means

285
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,160
just an American problem.

286
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,040
Globalization and technology
means that the gap is rising

287
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,920
all over the developed world.

288
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,880
It's just rising faster here.

289
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,600
In fact, in the United States,
the income ratio between our

290
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,880
richest and poorest
10% is now 16:1.

291
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,920
At this point, the rich are
just running up the score.

292
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,080
If our economy was
a Little League game,

293
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,080
someone would have
called it by now.

294
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,800
But what sets America apart
is that in this time, we have

295
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,960
actively introduced policies
disproportionately benefiting

296
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,000
the wealthy, like cutting
income tax and capital gains

297
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,960
tax rates for the richest in
half, as well as that weird

298
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,080
tax rebate for orgies with
fancy "Eyes Wide Shut" masks.

299
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,120
"The password is Fidelio."

300
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,920
You would think--you would
think, in a democracy,

301
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,160
policies that benefit very few
people at the expense of very

302
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,960
many would not be able to
succeed, but they have, and I

303
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,720
think the reason for that may
lie somewhere in America's

304
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,480
greatest quality: optimism.

305
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,160
It's basically
in how susceptible

306
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Americans are to this.

307
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,520
We have never been a nation
of haves and have-nots.

308
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,920
We are a nation of haves
and soon-to-haves,

309
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,000
of people who have made it
and people who will make it.

310
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,360
Yes! I mean no!
No. Hold on.

311
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,880
That sounds great.

312
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,960
The problem is, it makes
no sense economically,

313
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,600
mathematically,
or even grammatically.

314
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,080
And yet we believe him.

315
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,640
We believe him.

316
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,800
And there's a poll that
I think explains why.

317
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,400
A few months ago, Pew Research
revealed that 65% of Americans

318
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,760
believe the wealth gap is
increasing, and 60% believe

319
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,800
our system unfairly favors
the wealthy, but--and here's

320
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,120
the key--60% also believe
that most people who work hard

321
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,440
enough can make it,
or in other words,

322
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,400
"Yeah, I can clearly see
this game is rigged,

323
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,160
"which is what's gonna
make it so sweet

324
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,800
"when I win this thing!

325
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,800
Whoo!"

326
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,400
Tha--and it's good.

327
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,920
That's a good thing.

328
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,120
That optimism is one of
the things I love the most

329
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,600
about this country.

330
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,360
I love that you line up around
the block for TV talent shows

331
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,680
for talents you
objectively don't have,

332
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,840
and everyone feels bad
when a person who is

333
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,160
inevitably and revealingly
British does this to you.

334
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,640
It sounded like
2 3-year-olds

335
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,280
who have got flu
trying to sing.

336
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,800
I didn't find it funny,
and I like to laugh,

337
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,880
and that
wasn't funny to me.

338
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,240
I don't know what
that style was.

339
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,520
It started off like
bad food poisoning.

340
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,000
Without any doubt the worst act I've
probably ever seen.

341
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,840
You may want to

342
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,920
and start acting like an arrogant

343
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,440
Your mashed
potatoes are bland.

344
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,080
Wow. Wow. Hold on.

345
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,760
A British person just
told you that your

346
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,920
mashed potatoes were bland.

347
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,960
That has got to hurt.

348
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,800
The reason a British person
has to do that is that we're

349
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,920
raised in a rigid class system
where we have all hope beaten

350
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,080
out of us, and your optimism
is overwhelmingly positive,

351
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,120
except--except when it leads
you to act against your own

352
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,480
best interests.

353
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,120
Look at
the federal estate tax.

354
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,720
That's the tax that gets
paid on inherited wealth.

355
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,960
It helps to limit the terrible
possibility of a permanent

356
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,640
landed gentry--the idea that
a house can be passed down

357
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,440
through the generations until
some dipshit blows the fortune

358
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,640
on a Canadian railway
company, you fucking moron!

359
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,520
How could you do
that, Lord Grantham?

360
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,680
The family was
counting on you!

361
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,920
How could you!

362
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,880
And yet the estate tax here
is routinely on the verge

363
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,000
of being abolished.

364
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,040
Politicians call it
the death tax and get applause

365
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,960
for saying things like this.

366
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,680
My own view is we ought
to kill the death tax.

367
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,960
You paid for that farm once.

368
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,880
You shouldn't have to
pay for it again.

369
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,520
Except it's almost impossible
that a farmer would ever have

370
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,000
to do that.

371
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,160
The federal estate tax does
not apply to 99.4%

372
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,800
of all farm estates.

373
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,960
It also doesn't apply to
99.86% of anyone's estates.

374
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,200
Basically if you're not
comfortable calling your

375
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,680
accumulation of shit an
"estate," the estate tax

376
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,800
probably doesn't
fucking apply to you.

377
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,720
And yet the thing is,
a man worth

378
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,880
a quarter of a billion
dollars gets applause

379
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,120
for saying,
"Let's get rid of it."

380
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,960
Under current federal law,
heirs don't have to pay taxes

381
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,400
on the first 5.3 million that
you leave them, meaning that

382
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,360
you and your wife can leave
your kid more than $10 million

383
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,960
tax-free, and relax.

384
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,960
That is more than enough to
turn Chauncey into the world's

385
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,200
biggest piece of shit.

386
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Fuck you, Chauncey!

387
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,720
No 16-year-old has
a destination birthday party.

388
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,880
The tax on estates over
$5 million applies to almost

389
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,720
nobody, but one reason it's
constantly threatened is that

390
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,320
people assume that it will
one day apply to them.

391
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,920
I don't have
a 5-million-dollar estate.

392
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,160
I would like to someday.

393
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
But if I work all my life
and I pay my taxes

394
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,840
on my income
and then I die

395
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,120
and I want to pass on
what would be great if

396
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,960
it were a 5-million-dollar
estate to my kids,

397
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,920
why should I pay
the government again?

398
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,920
But you won't
be paying it!

399
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,960
You'll be gone!

400
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,040
In fact, this is
the practical embodiment

401
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,440
of everything you want.

402
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,880
This is the government
literally taking your money

403
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,800
over your dead body.

404
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,840
And also--also...

405
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,360
let's be clear.

406
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,440
Let's be clear.
The existence of an estate tax

407
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,400
has not prevented Americans

408
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,040
from passing on
a fuckload of wealth.

409
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,000
Of the billionaires on
the "Forbes" 400, 71 inherited

410
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,040
their fortune, and another
56 inherited at least

411
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,920
a portion of it.

412
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,120
That's nearly 1/3 of the list.

413
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,360
And our habit of handing
money down from generation to

414
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,600
generation perpetuates another
disparity, perhaps explaining

415
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:36,000
why, of the "Forbes" 400, only
.25% are African American,

416
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,720
and to answer your question,
yes, it's Oprah.

417
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,200
Oprah is the person.

418
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,720
You were right.
Good guess. Good guess.

419
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,520
America now has a system
where wealth is essentially

420
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,120
dispersed as a lottery of birth,
and maybe the reason we

421
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,520
seem to accept that is that
even though we know the odds

422
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,560
are stacked against us,
we all think we're going

423
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,120
to win the lottery.

424
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,160
Experts even appear on TV
advising us how to handle

425
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,080
our future winnings.

426
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,080
I think the first thing should be to
create a plan.

427
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,200
DIFFERENT MAN:
Set up a trust.

428
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
Probably hire a couple
of security guards.

429
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,720
FIRST MAN: Do you take the lump-sum
payment or

430
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,840
the 29-year annuity
payment over time?

431
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,200
I would take
the one-time cash chunk

432
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,080
because it allows you to
do a whole bunch of things

433
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,400
that you might want to do
in your life.

434
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,960
If you win that kind of money
and you still have young

435
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,880
children, make sure you
put it in a trust.

436
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,000
Oh, absolutely, because it
is never too early to start

437
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,440
protecting your imaginary
lottery winnings from

438
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,800
crippling estate taxes.

439
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,240
That's crazy.

440
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,680
You...

441
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,080
you might as well do
an 8-minute segment on how to

442
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,240
handle being attacked by
a shark while scoring

443
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,320
the winning touchdown
at the Super Bowl

444
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,000
or things to say on your
third date with Beyonc.

445
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,280
And watch how--
it would be great.

446
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,880
That would be great.

447
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,160
There's a chance.

448
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,040
Technically, there's a chance.

449
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,920
And watch how depressed we get
by useful, practical advice.

450
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,240
Would you tell people,
maybe take your $5.00

451
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,720
you're gonna spend on the jackpot
and put it elsewhere?

452
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,800
If you can invest
that money,

453
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,880
20, 30 years down
the road,

454
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,480
that is gonna be
a much better--

455
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,560
there would be much
better odds

456
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,800
of having a secure
retirement

457
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
than hoping
on the lottery.

458
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,400
It's not nearly
as fantasy, though.

459
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,640
No, it's not.

460
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,640
So much more practical.

461
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,320
Please, please don't mess
up this financial segment

462
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,880
with practical advice.

463
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,280
We're dream weavers
here at News Team 12.

464
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,480
Take that shit over
to News Team 5.

465
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,960
Look, look.

466
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,200
The whole point is,
if American wealth is a lottery,

467
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,080
we are increasingly
playing two different games.

468
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,880
In fact, I'll show you.

469
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,920
Who wants to play Americaball?

470
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,200
OK, as always, we
have two drawings.

471
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,600
First up, the draw for people with
inherited wealth.

472
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,760
You should all have a ticket at home
with a number

473
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,040
between 1 and 3 on it,
so let's pick 2 balls.

474
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,520
Let's pick 2 balls.

475
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,840
Fire it up. Here we go.

476
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,160
3!

477
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,480
The first number is 3.

478
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,280
Let's pick another ball.

479
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,520
1!

480
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,880
Congratulations to
almost everyone at home!

481
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,680
OK, that was fun.
That was fun.

482
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,000
OK, so now the lottery

483
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,000
for those who
were born poor.

484
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,800
OK.

485
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,960
Tank.

486
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,200
Uh, hello to all of you
watching at home

487
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,080
or through
a Best Buy window.

488
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,960
You should all have
a card with a number

489
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,080
between 1 and
3.5 million on it,

490
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,880
and you've probably
noticed that

491
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,840
a disproportionate percentage of
these balls

492
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,920
are black and brown.

493
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,960
Ignore that. It's illustrative
of nothing.

494
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,360
I can't stress
that enough.

495
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,960
Isn't that right, Tank?

496
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,680
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah.

497
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,800
Now, as you can see, for the third
consecutive week,

498
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,520
this machine
is still broken,

499
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,920
so I can't currently
get a ball out

500
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,880
of there for you, but let's all agree
that technically,

501
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,720
you did all have the hypothetical
chance to win!

502
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,960
So this is depressing.

503
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,520
Hey, remember how much fun we were
having over there?

504
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,560
Let's go back over.

505
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,960
There's still
a ball in there.

506
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,480
Let's get that last
ball out of there.

507
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,640
Just one more.

508
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,920
Oh, number 2!

509
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,760
You're all winners!
All of you!

510
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,680
You can't lose!
The system works!

511
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,800
And don't worry,
poor people.

512
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,440
If you're getting sad,
you're just thinking

513
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,760
of this the wrong way.

514
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,680
Remember, when it comes
to the wealth lottery,

515
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,120
America is a nation
of winners

516
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,360
and soon-to winners.

517
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,920
Yes! And now this.

518
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,040
ANNOUNCER: And now,
"Last Week Tonight" presents

519
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,120
"Fuck that guy."

520
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:44,320
This week, Jerome Valcke,
the Secretary General of FIFA.

521
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,800
As you may have seen earlier
today, Germany won

522
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,880
the World Cup, capping off
a thrilling tournament

523
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,040
filled with joy, tears,
and the occasional

524
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,920
act of cannibalism.

525
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,800
There was only one thing
that marred

526
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,240
the month-long tournament.

527
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,800
FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke says

528
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,880
he's amazed and
surprised by the amount

529
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,520
of alcohol that's
being consumed

530
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,600
at the World Cup.

531
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,720
ANNOUNCER: In an interview
with Brazilian TV,

532
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,880
Valcke said, "I was amazed by
the number of people who were

533
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,280
drunken and the level
of alcohol."

534
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,640
And "When you drink too much,
the level of violence

535
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,320
may increase."

536
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,920
Here's the thing--
Brazil knew that.

537
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,880
In 2003, the Brazilian
government banned alcohol

538
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,960
from stadiums because
of the enormously high

539
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,080
death rate amongst fans.

540
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,920
ANNOUNCER: As you may recall
from our show a month ago,

541
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,400
the country was pressured to
suspend the laws by one

542
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,040
Jerome Valcke, who presumably
acted on behalf of one

543
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,160
of FIFA's key sponsors.

544
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,440
ANNOUNCER: And to be fair
to Jerome Valcke,

545
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,440
how could he possibly have known
that selling beer to people

546
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,800
might lead to them
drinking it?

547
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,280
So when the man who helped
remove safety-based controls

548
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,800
on beer sales has
the balls to say,

549
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,280
"We will always take
safety into account.

550
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,800
"If we believe beer sales
should be controlled,

551
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,400
it will be controlled,"
it leads us to say,

552
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,960
FIFA Secretary General
Jerome Valcke?

553
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,440
Fuck that guy.

554
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,560
And that's a good point.
It's a good point.

555
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,360
And finally tonight,
big news in the world

556
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,600
of international espionage.

557
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,920
The German government has
ordered the CIA's station chief

558
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,720
in Germany to get out of
the country--the kind of thing

559
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,920
we almost never see with
a close ally, but Germany is

560
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,800
outraged by what it
considers U.S. spy games.

561
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,600
Yeah. I'd say that this is
just sour German grapes,

562
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,920
but I know that they
use all of those

563
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,320
for their shitty Rieslings.

564
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,800
Yes! Yes!

565
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,760
That's why I came to HBO--

566
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,920
premium high-end wine jokes.

567
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,680
Yes.

568
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,600
The CIA has been caught spying on Germany again.

569
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,080
It's just the latest black eye
for the CIA, who in recent

570
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,800
years have been accused
of torture, abuse,

571
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,880
and illegal surveillance
around the globe.

572
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,080
Perhaps that's why they've
recently taken some steps

573
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,200
to change
their public image.

574
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,800
This is the CIA,
and they've just

575
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,160
officially
joined Twitter.

576
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,840
The CIA also
officially has

577
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,880
a sense of humor.

578
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,280
Check out the first
tweet from the Agency:

579
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,560
"We can neither
confirm nor deny

580
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,320
that this is
our first tweet. "

581
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,640
Ha ha ha!

582
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,840
Ha ha ha! Oh, yeah.

583
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,760
Hey. I get it.

584
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,680
You're a dangerously
secretive operation who work

585
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,440
in the shadows with little
accountability or oversight.

586
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,200
Ha ha ha!

587
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,120
Look, I'm not gonna say that
this is a completely unfunny

588
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,480
tweet, but
the context is wrong.

589
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,800
It's like if a doctor
interrupted Wolf Blitzer's

590
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
colonoscopy by
shouting, "Oh, my God!

591
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,840
Wolf, I think I've just
found the missing plane!"

592
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,720
I'm not saying that
wouldn't be funny.

593
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,240
It's just it's neither
the time nor the place

594
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,440
for a comment like that.

595
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,800
That's the point.

596
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,800
And since then, the CIA's
questionable taste in jokes

597
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,840
has only gotten worse.

598
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,880
The CIA also tweeted out, "No,
we don't know your password,

599
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,760
"so we can't send it to you.

600
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,480
#sorrynotsorry."

601
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,080
The CIA says, "No, we
don't know where Tupac is."

602
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,960
What are you doing?

603
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,240
Tupac was famously murdered.

604
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,800
He didn't vanish.

605
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,920
The mystery isn't where he is;
it's who killed him, which,

606
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,440
incidentally, you
probably do know.

607
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,920
In fact, the more you poke
around on the CIA's website,

608
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,880
the more you find things
that make you question

609
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,240
their social media team.

610
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,800
This is a real video
from the CIA K-9 unit.

611
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,200
GIRLISH VOICE:
My name is Bradley.

612
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,840
I'm an explosive-detection
K-9 officer at the CIA.

613
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,960
Have you ever wondered how
an ordinary dog becomes a K-9?

614
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,040
Hi, Chessie.

615
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,080
How do you like being
a K-9 so far?

616
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,240
MALE VOICE:
It's great.

617
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,520
I'm learning a lot.

618
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,400
How would you like to tell these
folks about what

619
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,480
it takes to become
a CIA K-9?

620
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,720
I would love to.

621
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,840
Great.

622
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,680
What the--

623
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,840
what the hell
did we just watch there?

624
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,600
And by the way, CIA, you have
a secret budget with virtually

625
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,320
no oversight,
and you can't even make

626
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,120
their fucking mouths move?

627
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,680
Even the dogs probably know
that this video is weird.

628
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,920
In fact, if we could hear what
the dogs were really thinking,

629
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,960
I'd bet you it would sound
a lot more like this.

630
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,480
Hey, Chessie.

631
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,960
How do you like being
in a video for the CIA?

632
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,320
Seems kind of weird.

633
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,000
I mean, who is this for?

634
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,360
Kids, I guess.

635
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,720
Sure, but why?

636
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,880
I don't know.

637
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,960
The CIA has
an image problem?

638
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,880
Well, then maybe they
should stop operating

639
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,840
secret prisons
from Poland to Djibouti

640
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,840
and needlessly spying on our closest allies
during peacetime.

641
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,400
Hey, that
might work.

642
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,760
Yay!
Hooray!

643
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,800
Woof!

644
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,960
That's good. See?

645
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,400
It's good.
People liked it.

646
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,000
That could be viral.

647
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,080
Look.

648
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,360
Look, CIA.

649
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,480
I get that you want to be
the fun one, but, "A," you

650
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,840
shouldn't be, and "B,"

651
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,240
you're not even
very good at it.

652
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,880
Don't waste your time writing
jokes when we can all help

653
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,880
you with that.

654
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,360
Here's one right now.

655
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,880
Hey, "Two and a Half Men" got
renewed for a 12th season.

656
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,480
That show is harder
to kill than Fidel Castro,

657
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,720
#murderfail.

658
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,960
Or perhaps you'd like
your old-school jokes.

659
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,240
Here's one.

660
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,960
3 Arab guys walk into a bar.

661
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,640
Two of them are never
heard from again.

662
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,920
#wheredidtheygo?
#secretprison #Uzbekistan.

663
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,080
In fact--in fact, I would
invite everyone at home to

664
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,960
help the CIA write jokes
more suitable to their

665
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,800
actual history.

666
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,720
Simply use the hashtag
#BETTERCIATWEETS.

667
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,320
Because you can't spell
"colossal privacy violation"

668
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,880
without LOL.

669
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,320
That's our show
for this evening.

670
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,720
Thank you so much
for watching.

671
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,800
We will be back next Sunday.

672
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,760
Have a great week!
