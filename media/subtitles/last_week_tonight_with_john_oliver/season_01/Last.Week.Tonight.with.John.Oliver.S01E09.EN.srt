1
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,720
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight"!

2
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,800
I'm John Oliver. Thanks for being with us.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,800
A quick recap of what happened this week.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,960
It's basically been all about the World Cup.

5
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,040
The USA escaped the group of death.

6
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,120
Congratulations.

7
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,760
However, England have been knocked out,

8
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,000
so this stupid tournament is now dead to me.

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,640
Dead.

10
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,800
The games have been absolutely amazing all week,

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,800
although one incident in particular caught

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,600
everyone's attention.

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,200
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: It was the chomp

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,040
seen around the world.

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,040
Uruguay's Luis Suarez, one of
the top players in the world,

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,960
appears to take a bite out of
an Italian defender's shoulder.

17
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,680
Did he or didn't he?

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,560
Oh, he did.
Oh, he did.

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,800
He bit that human being.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,040
And in his defense,
that is one delicious piece of

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,360
prime Italian steak
he's tucking into right there.

22
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,920
Incredibly, this is
actually the third time

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,960
that Suarez has done this.

24
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,080
If he bites 7 more people,
he gets a free person.

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,120
But Suarez--relax--Suarez
did not leave the World Cup

26
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,760
without also scoring the excuse
of the tournament.

27
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,720
MALE ANNOUNCER: Suarez insists
he didn't bite

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,320
Giorgio Chiellini, saying,
"I lost my balance,

29
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,920
making my body unstable and
falling on top of my opponent."

30
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,480
That makes
complete sense.

31
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,000
It's just like someone claiming
they ruined their diet because

32
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,400
they tripped and fell face-first
into an entire cheesecake.

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,120
Meanwhile, in a week
of horrible news

34
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,040
about terrorist incidents
around the world,

35
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,640
there was one unexpectedly
encouraging development.

36
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,280
You know, for months,
Nigeria's army

37
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,400
has been trying
to flush out

38
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,040
the Islamic sect
of Boko Haram

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,520
militants in hiding.

40
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,960
Well, now it appears

41
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,880
they're leaving
voluntarily,

42
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,880
at least some of them.

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,800
According to
the Vanguard,

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,920
they're being driven
out of the forest

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,920
by snakes and bees.

46
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,320
What? Snakes and bees?

47
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,720
I never thought I'd say this,

48
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,800
but thank goodness for that
angry swarm of snakes and bees.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,240
Thank you, snakes.
Thank you, bees.

50
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,800
The only way I could love
this story more would be

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,800
if those bees were actually
riding the snakes into battle.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,840
On my signal, slither!

53
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,840
Slither!

54
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,800
And by the way, I would like
to take a quick moment

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,880
to say,
what the fuck, scorpions?

56
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,880
Where the hell have you
been during all this?

57
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,800
A man shopping at a Walmart
in the south hills

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,920
got more than a bargain when he
went to reach for some bananas.

59
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,960
He got a pinch from a scorpion.

60
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,120
Scorpions,
what is wrong with you?

61
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,880
Stop hiding in bananas
in Pittsburgh-area Walmarts.

62
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:19,440
Get your shit together and fight
terrorism like snakes and bees.

63
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,120
And finally--finally, Syria

64
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,960
remains in a state
of utter chaos.

65
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,280
But this week, the White House
finally issued

66
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,800
its most significant
action yet.

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,080
The White House
announced Thursday

68
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,800
it's seeking $500 million
from Congress

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,840
to aid moderate rebels
in Syria.

70
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,440
The aid will be used
to train and equip

71
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,160
appropriately vetted elements
of the moderate Syrian

72
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,240
armed opposition.

73
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,920
Hold on.
How exactly do you

74
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,080
appropriately vet
a rebel soldier?

75
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,040
Do you sit down with them
at a local Starbucks

76
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,200
and go over their resume?

77
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,640
Now, it says here that you
spent a year as an intern

78
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,200
for a Kurdish
freedom fighting movement.

79
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,480
Fascinating. Tell us a little
about that experience.

80
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,720
Look, there are 1,000 distinct
armed units in Syria,

81
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,960
and some of them
are horrifying.

82
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,960
So, if we are going to
recruit the right ones,

83
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,760
we need to do this properly.

84
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,120
MALE ANNOUNCER: Are you
a Syrian who is interested in

85
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,880
toppling your
country's government?

86
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,760
Are you certifiably
not a terrorist?

87
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,960
Do you promise you're
not a terrorist?

88
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,200
Because you have
to say if you are.

89
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,800
Then you might qualify to be
an appropriately vetted element

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,800
of the armed opposition.

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,960
Come be part of an exciting and
fast-paced work environment

92
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,040
where you'll work alongside
a dynamic team of people

93
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,960
who, like you, are hopefully,

94
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,040
definitely not terrorists.

95
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,000
You'll be provided benefits
packages that could include

96
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,440
standard-issue M16 rifles,

97
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,680
M249 light machine guns,

98
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,560
the hypothetical
chance of a stable

99
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,520
democratic state in Syria,

100
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,680
and maybe rocket launchers.

101
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,960
And for a limbed time,
this offer is also open

102
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,880
to bees and snakes.

103
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,120
So, sign up now.

104
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,520
Your future as an
appropriately-vetted element

105
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,840
starts today.

106
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,200
Tomorrow is scheduled
to be the last day

107
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,160
of the Supreme Court's
current term.

108
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,760
After that, the only two cases
they'll be considering

109
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,400
are pool noodle vs. pool noodle
and mouth vs. margarita.

110
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,160
But before they go, they've got
two decisions left to deliver,

111
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,240
including this one.

112
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,880
The biggest one we're waiting on
at this point is Hobby Lobby.

113
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,720
This is the challenge
to the administration's

114
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,160
HHS contraception mandate.

115
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,800
That's right.
Hobby Lobby,

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,360
America's one-stop source
for glitter and googly eyes,

117
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,240
could soon also be America's
leading source of landmark

118
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,920
binding legal precedents.

119
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,360
Hobby Lobby's owners say that Obamacare's
contraception mandate

120
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,160
conflicts with their
Christian faith,

121
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,200
which means the whole
case boils down

122
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,960
to one fundamental question.

123
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,800
Can a business,
a for-profit corporation,

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,960
claim it has
freedom of religion?

125
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,800
Do for-profit corporations
have religious rights?

126
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,640
Do corporations have
religious liberties

127
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,560
or do just individuals?

128
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,880
Are corporations a person able
to exercise religious rights?

129
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,400
No, no, they're not.
OK, we done?

130
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,000
Are we done here?
Are we done?

131
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,600
I feel like we're done.

132
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,440
Apparently we're not done,

133
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,520
because thanks to
the Citizens United ruling

134
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,800
in which corporations
were deemed to have

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,960
the same free speech
rights as people,

136
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,760
it is now a possibility they may
get religious rights as well

137
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,640
and if they do, it's
going to be pretty easy

138
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,840
to guess which
religions they'll choose.

139
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,000
Einstein Brothers?
Obviously Jewish.

140
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,560
Although they do sell bacon
and are open on Saturdays,

141
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,320
so let's say more culturally
Jewish than observant.

142
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,840
Meanwhile, Ben & Jerry's,
clearly Buddhist.

143
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,480
Although not too Buddhist, or
they'd be selling you pints of

144
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,160
cookies and nothingness.

145
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,360
And Taco Bell, I'm presuming,
is Hindu, because you know

146
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,200
there's no fucking beef
in those things.

147
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,160
But in the case of Hobby Lobby,
the company's founders

148
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,760
are the devoutly Christian
Green family.

149
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,280
And to be fair, their faith
has led them to do

150
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,920
some genuinely
admirable things.

151
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,160
We believe that the principles
that are taught scripturally

152
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,000
are what we should
operate our lives by,

153
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,640
and so it naturally flows over
into the business.

154
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,960
FEMALE ANNOUNCER:
The company pays full-time

155
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,240
entry-level employees
90% above minimum wage

156
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,800
and devotes a very large
portion of its profits

157
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,840
to a broad array of charities.

158
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,240
Well, that's fantastic.

159
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,640
Although, I wouldn't
get on too high a horse

160
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,480
about the moral high ground
of your company,

161
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,960
given that a solid chunk of your
customer base are Etsy sellers

162
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,520
buying yarn to make handmade
cock-and-ball cozies

163
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,640
and teenagers purchasing
top-quality glue for huffing.

164
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,960
Oh, really, Bobby? You're into model airplanes,
are you?

165
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,240
Build one for me right now!

166
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,520
You can't, can you, boy?

167
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,440
You're killing your mother!

168
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,800
You're killing her, Bobby!

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,360
But here's the thing.
While Hobby Lobby's owners

170
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,800
are seemingly sincere
in their beliefs,

171
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,320
their sincerity isn't
really the point.

172
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,720
Just as it isn't the point
with the other company

173
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,000
which is also part
of this decision.

174
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,840
MALE ANNOUNCER: Conestoga Wood,
a company that makes

175
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,720
parts for kitchen cabinets,

176
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,880
is owned by a
Pennsylvania-based Hahn family.

177
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,960
They are Mennonites.

178
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,120
That's right.
In addition to Hobby Lobby,

179
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,720
the government
is also being sued

180
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,920
by Mennonites or, as I believe
they're called, the Diet Amish.

181
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,080
The Mennonites are
cabinet-making pacifists

182
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,080
who argue that they don't want
to pay for something

183
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,760
that could take a human life.

184
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,560
But under that logic,
that is why I

185
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,120
personally refuse to pay
for Mennonite cabinets,

186
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,960
because Jason Bourne
could, conceivably,

187
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,240
beat someone to death
with one of those things.

188
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,960
What these companies
are arguing

189
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,320
is that the sincerity of
their beliefs should allow them

190
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,920
a line item veto
over federal law.

191
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,240
But government is not
an a la carte system

192
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,800
where you can pick and choose
based on your beliefs.

193
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,560
Taxation is more of an
all-you-can-eat salad bar.

194
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,440
You don't get to show up
and go, "Look,

195
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,880
"I know it costs $10.99,
but I'm only paying $7.50

196
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,120
because I have a moral
objection to beets."

197
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,560
Because of course you do.

198
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,840
They're an abomination
of a root vegetable.

199
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,920
Their bland flavor
and slimy texture

200
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,160
is an affront unto the Lord.

201
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,200
And if you can persuade
enough people of that,

202
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,320
then you can have a referendum
to remove beets

203
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,000
from the salad bar
in the future.

204
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,960
But until such time, you're
paying for those fucking beets.

205
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,560
Because everyone has
their own version of beets.

206
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,960
I don't want
my tax dollars

207
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,280
paying for
abortions.

208
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,720
I don't want my tax dollars
going in support

209
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,840
of this Israeli policy.

210
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,960
I don't want my tax dollars spent
to support this mosque.

211
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,960
I don't want my tax money being
used to buy illegal drugs.

212
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,640
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: A shrimp
running on a treadmill.

213
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,560
Not sure it's the best use
of my tax dollars right now.

214
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,880
I'm sure Pam in Kansas
doesn't want her tax dollar

215
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,880
spent on some of the things
that they're spending it,

216
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,160
especially
Mexican prostitutes.

217
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,840
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

218
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,720
OK. Look. I can see your point on the prostitution,

219
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,880
but those fat shrimp need help.

220
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,440
You think they like
being called jumbo?

221
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,160
They're crying inside.

222
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,000
If you really want to be treated
like a person,

223
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,000
corporations, then guess what?

224
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,680
Pay for things you don't like

225
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,920
is what it feels like
to be one.

226
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,520
In fact, if corporations
want to be people,

227
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,240
they should have to take
the rough with the smooth.

228
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,720
For a start, companies should
only get to have

229
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,240
the average lifespan
of a person--79 years.

230
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,880
75 if they're
based in Mississippi.

231
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Oh, oh, and female companies,

232
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,680
you only get to make
83 cents on the dollar.

233
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,960
Sorry, Wendy, I guess
it's just that Burger King

234
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,480
must have worked harder.

235
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,360
And that's just the big stuff.

236
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,320
There's also the little
annoyances of being human,

237
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,640
so, Mr. Peanut, I hope
you enjoy attending

238
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,960
your friends' shitty
improv shows.

239
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,360
And Starbucks,
get ready to have

240
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,960
your name spelled
"Starburst" on your coffee cup.

241
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,960
And for G.M., who've admitted
some responsibility

242
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,360
for the deaths of a minimum of 13 people,

243
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,040
I've got some bad news for you.

244
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,800
People who do that
generally don't get off

245
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,080
with a fucking fine.

246
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,960
And now this.

247
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,840
MALE ANNOUNCER: And now,
politicians literally misusing

248
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,040
the word "literally."

249
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,880
The arrogance here is
literally breathtaking.

250
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,320
Why should any of us
attack children?

251
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,040
Literally take food out of
the mouths of children.

252
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,080
And literally had to
bludgeon and pummel them

253
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,920
into doing, not physically.

254
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,560
Literally went ballistic.

255
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,840
Literally howling.

256
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,880
Literally strangling.

257
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,400
Literally hanging
high and very dry.

258
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,000
Literally thank you.

259
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,760
And finally, finally tonight.

260
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,360
It was the gay pride parade
today in New York,

261
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,840
which capped a month--

262
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,280
which capped a great month
of significant advances

263
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,520
for marriage equality
in America.

264
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,920
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: The White
House is granting new benefits

265
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,440
to same-sex couples, including
those who live in states

266
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,320
where gay marriage
is against the law.

267
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,720
To date, 19 states
and the District of Columbia

268
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,080
have legalized marriage quality
and the momentum continues.

269
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,080
That's right.
We are nearly halfway

270
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,400
to full nationwide
marriage equality,

271
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,200
which means it's
about to become

272
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,000
a question of which state
is going to be last.

273
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,920
Who could it
possibly be, Mississippi?

274
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,880
We don't know.
We don't know, Mississippi.

275
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,880
It could be
anyone, Mississippi.

276
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,760
Now, I know it's
a little premature,

277
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,760
but I do think this might be
one of those moments

278
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,240
where we're allowed to feel
great about this country.

279
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,960
Marriage equality is sweeping
the nation, and America did it!

280
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,480
Strike up the band!

281
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,680
Bring out the rock-n-roll George
Washington and the Americake!

282
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,960
Yes!

283
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,280
I see no reason why this
feeling is ever going to end!

284
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,400
It's fantastic. Yes!

285
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,160
Ok, OK, OK.
Hold on.

286
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,800
Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on.

287
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,360
Because unfortunately,
this month has also brought

288
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,200
less good news from other countries.

289
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,520
There is great controversy
over the new UN

290
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,200
General Assembly
president.

291
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
Uganda's Sam Kutesa
has been

292
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,920
elected to the largely
ceremonial role,

293
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,160
but thousands have signed a petition
against the appointment

294
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,840
because of Uganda's harsh laws
on homosexuality.

295
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,360
Yeah, calling Uganda's
laws harsh

296
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,680
doesn't really do them justice.

297
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,560
That's like calling Stalin
a bit of a grump,

298
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,000
or the Triangle Shirtwaist
Factory fire a whoopsie doo,

299
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,640
or the "Titanic"
a disappointing vacation.

300
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,560
Because let's take a moment
to remind ourselves

301
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,800
about what Uganda's laws
actually contain.

302
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,320
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: On Monday,
the president of Uganda

303
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,920
signed a sweeping
anti-gay bill into law.

304
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,600
It makes it illegal simply
to be gay in the country

305
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,720
and imposes harsh prison
sentences for offenders.

306
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,480
So, the moral arc
of the universe is long,

307
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,480
and it bends away from Uganda.

308
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,640
And the law isn't just putting
gays at risk of imprisonment.

309
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,680
Since it passed
the Ugandan legislature,

310
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,800
the number of recorded
acts of persecution

311
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,880
has increased between 750%
and 1900% from previous years.

312
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,120
It's gotten to the point where
people from the Dark Ages

313
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,880
could build a time machine,
travel to 2014 Uganda,

314
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,840
step outside and go,
"Ah, shit, it didn't work."

315
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,440
OK. Nice try.
Get back in.

316
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,840
Now, you might wonder
how can the UN

317
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,320
allow a representative of
the Ugandan government,

318
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,480
which has also been
accused of corruption

319
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,400
and the brutal suppression
of dissent,

320
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,960
to be in charge of their
general assembly?

321
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,840
MALE ANNOUNCER: Sam Kutesa is
chosen without a vote.

322
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,920
The selection is done
on geographical rotation

323
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,520
and African countries
had already agreed

324
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,240
he'd be their candidate.

325
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,760
Oh, that's fine, then.
So, it's just their turn.

326
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,800
Essentially, the UN
apparently works

327
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,840
according to the same principle
as family movie night where,

328
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,880
even if your little sister picks "My Little Pony: Friendship is
Magic Princess Twilight Sparkle"

329
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,160
for the third time,
you have to watch it

330
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,280
because it's her fucking turn.

331
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,080
The fact that,
in the 21st century,

332
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,920
81 countries have laws
outlawing homosexuality

333
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,560
is incredibly depressing.

334
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,800
Although, in a way,

335
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,080
it shows how lucky
we are to live here.

336
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,560
Because remember, when it comes
to advances in marriage quality,

337
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,560
America did it!

338
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,920
Am I right, cheerleaders?

339
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,960
Yes, my dancing Lincoln is here!

340
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,120
This exuberance is never
going to blow up in our face!

341
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,040
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

342
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,960
OK. OK.

343
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,000
Oh, this feels so good.

344
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,920
Just out of interest,

345
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,920
where did Uganda get the idea

346
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,760
to come up with
such hateful laws?

347
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,920
MALE ANNOUNCER: Uganda has had
laws against homosexuality

348
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,600
for virtually
all the past century.

349
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,160
They were introduced in
the old British colonial days.

350
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,080
Whoopsie daisy.

351
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,320
I've gotta be honest--
being British is sometimes

352
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,120
a little like being an alcoholic.

353
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,440
When someone says you did
something awful,

354
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,120
you find yourself
going, "Honestly,

355
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,440
"I don't even
remember doing that,

356
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,000
"but yeah, probably, probably.

357
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,480
"I'm a dick.
I'm a dick.

358
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,080
What do you want me to say?"

359
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,600
OK. So, fundamentally, it's
the British people's fault.

360
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,440
But, you know,
I live in America now,

361
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,920
so, I've still got a
pretty warm feeling inside me,

362
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,680
unless someone is about
to take that away from me.

363
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,800
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: The irony,
gay rights activists say,

364
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,640
is that it was a small group
of American evangelicals

365
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,480
who came to Uganda speaking out
against homosexuality,

366
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,080
which was already illegal,

367
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,720
that really took the persecution
of the LGBT community

368
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,760
to a new level.

369
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,080
Wait, so what you're
essentially saying is,

370
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,880
America did this?

371
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,960
No! No! No!

372
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,400
Get back in that cake!

373
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,840
Get back in that cake
and get out of here!

374
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,040
All of you, get out of here and
think about what you've done!

375
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,360
Shame on you!
Shame on you!

376
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,120
Shame on you!
Shame on you!

377
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,000
OK. OK.

378
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,120
So, it turns out American
anti-gay activists

379
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,880
were in Uganda in the run-up
to the passage of the law.

380
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,440
And let's meet
just one of them.

381
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,280
Scott Lively.
Now, if that name rings a bell,

382
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,440
you may know him as one of
those far-right Christians

383
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,480
who go on TV
and say things like this.

384
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,680
I think Mr. Obama may well be
a homosexual himself.

385
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
that's clearly wrong.

386
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,760
It's not Mr. Obama,
it's President Obama.

387
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,840
President Obama is a homosexual.
Get it right.

388
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,800
Have some respect.

389
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,720
Now, if you live
in Massachusetts,

390
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,800
you may also know Scott Lively
as that crazy guy

391
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,360
currently running for governor,

392
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,800
and who's attempting
to take back

393
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,760
the symbol of the rainbow from
the gays by promoting this song.

394
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,160
WOMAN:  The rainbow
belongs to God

395
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:58,760
Untouched by evil desire

396
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,840
Whoa. Whoa.

397
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,400
I feel like if Kermit
ever heard that song,

398
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,920
he would immediately insist on
one fewer songs about rainbows.

399
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,440
Look, Scott Lively
is clearly an idiot.

400
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,640
And luckily, over here,
we just get to laugh at him.

401
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,960
You are never going
to stop AIDS

402
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,800
until you stop treating

403
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,520
homosexual sodomy
as a civil right

404
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:32,480
and start treating it as
a form of conduct to avoid.

405
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,200
The guy's material
is killing out there.

406
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,680
What's up with how HIV's only transmittable between
homosexuals, huh?

407
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,600
Is this on? Huh? Huh?

408
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,920
This guy knows what
I'm talking about.

409
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,720
Unfortunately, though,
in Uganda,

410
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,320
it is a very different story.

411
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,720
MAN: In America, he's a nobody.

412
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:57,920
But in Africa, this extremist
guy becomes this spokesperson

413
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,440
and is able to address the entire parliament

414
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,360
for 5 hours.

415
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,600
I don't know what's
more shocking there,

416
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,360
that he addressed
the parliament at all

417
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,080
or that he did it for 5 hours.

418
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,360
Because listen, if your hard-on
for homophobia lasts 5 hours,

419
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,240
you need to seek
medical attention.

420
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,560
And he didn't just stop there.

421
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,680
Scott Lively spoke
on Ugandan TV

422
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,040
and gave seminars attended by
Ugandan government officials.

423
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,160
And here is where Scott Lively

424
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,160
is about to get
considerably less funny.

425
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,800
Increasingly, lesbians are
being molested by other women.

426
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,440
It's actually becoming
more and more common

427
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,520
in the United States.

428
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,600
How dare you say
that homosexuality

429
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,320
and pedophilia are equated?

430
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,600
Well, they are equated.

431
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,560
They have very little
sense of mercy.

432
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,800
The Rwandan stuff
probably involved these guys.

433
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,080
These were the Nazis.
The Nazis.

434
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,360
It's like he just ate
the most offensive package

435
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,680
of magnetic poetry
and then vomited it

436
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
all over his audience.

437
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,400
And then later that year,

438
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,920
Uganda's anti-homosexuality bill
was introduced,

439
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,120
and for the record, Lively says
he doesn't approve of it

440
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,160
and disclaims any
influence over it.

441
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,720
I do not support
and never did support

442
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,280
the harsh penalties in terms of long
prison sentences.

443
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,080
I don't believe in that.
I never have.

444
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,160
No, of course not. You are simply saying,
look, guys,

445
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,840
gay people are dangerous
insidious Nazis.

446
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,160
Do with that information
what you will.

447
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,040
Lively out.
Lively out.

448
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,240
Why back off now, Scott?
Own it!

449
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,800
If God hates gays as much
as you think he does,

450
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,160
he's going to be
pretty pissed at you

451
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,040
for not seeing
this thing through.

452
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,400
And it's not just Scott Lively.

453
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,240
One of Uganda's most prominent
anti-gay preachers

454
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,600
is a pastor named
Martin Ssempa.

455
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,000
Let's listen in on
one of his lovely sermons.

456
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,520
I've gotta say,
for an anti-gay pastor,

457
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,480
that man clearly had very quick
access to a lot of fetish porn.

458
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,640
Very swift, just
oh, there we go.

459
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,360
Martin Ssempa is not American.
He has in the past, however,

460
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,840
received funding from the Canyon Ridge Christian
Church in Las Vegas

461
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,600
and the U.S. government, which
allocated his organization

462
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,480
$40,000 for
abstinence education,

463
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,880
which he presumably
responsibly spent on gay porn

464
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,840
to show during sermons.

465
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,840
But if you want
a single sound bite

466
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,040
that sums up
the depressing scale

467
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,800
of the American
cultural influence

468
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,760
on Ugandan homophobia,
it is this.

469
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,960
In the beginning, it was Adam
and Eve, not Adam and Steve.

470
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,640
Yeah. That's not
a Uganda saying.

471
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,960
Let me give you 3 names that are
not especially common in Africa:

472
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,800
Adam, Eve, and Steve.

473
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,120
So, clearly, U.S. groups

474
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,800
recognized the market for homophobia stateside
was dwindling,

475
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,640
and so tried to sell it
somewhere else,

476
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,520
meaning that Africa isn't
just where we send our

477
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,480
losing team's
Super Bowl shirts,

478
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,840
it's also where we now send our losing
political philosophies.

479
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,280
And although the U.S.
is now issuing sanctions

480
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,120
in reaction to these laws,

481
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,240
this is clearly a problem
that Uganda is going

482
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,080
to have to solve itself.

483
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,560
And here we may have
one small glimmer of hope,

484
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,120
because in researching
this story, we found a clip

485
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,960
of an interview on
a Ugandan morning show

486
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,440
with a transgender
human rights activist

487
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,880
named Pepe Julian Onziema.

488
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,240
Pepe Julian Onziema,
thank you for coming in.

489
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,000
Good morning.
Why are you gay?

490
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,640
Whoa. OK, so, we're just
jumping straight into it then.

491
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,520
No warmup question there.
Straight into it.

492
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,840
And that set the tone
for that activist's

493
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,880
hour-long marathon
of restraint.

494
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,840
Don't you think
gays, homosexuals,

495
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,440
lesbians,
transgendered

496
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,240
should instantly
be reoriented

497
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,200
other than receiving this kind
of recognition,

498
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,320
because society seems to deem them
as unnatural,

499
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,840
as people who are,
may be lost.

500
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,920
Simon, you are sitting
with me right now.

501
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,640
How unnatural is that?

502
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,240
Well, it's natural, but I'm
just baffled.

503
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,400
Baffled? Yeah,
but that's the point.

504
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,480
If you're baffled by something,
you don't automatically

505
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,880
throw it in jail.

506
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,520
Otherwise, American prisons

507
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,320
would be full of
Keurig coffee machines.

508
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,960
Wait. Is it water first,
then the cup?

509
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,440
Do you take the lid off?

510
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,000
Somebody put this witchcraft
behind bars!

511
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,720
It's wrong!
It's morally wrong!

512
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,080
I'm frightened!

513
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,280
But to his true credit,
Pepe Onziema

514
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,920
somehow kept his cool
the whole time.

515
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,680
Why do you recruit
young boys and girls

516
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,040
into this gay activism?

517
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,080
There is no such thing
as recruitment

518
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,760
of young people or adults
or anything like that.

519
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,400
What is recruitment,
first of all?

520
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,480
When you ask me
about recruitment,

521
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,120
what do you mean
by recruitment?

522
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,880
I mean trying to put
them into your system,

523
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,000
teaching them what to do,
how to go about it.

524
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,320
We do not do that.

525
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,240
How does a human being maintain
that level of composure

526
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,840
and say, "We do not do that"
rather than

527
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,120
"What the fuck
is wrong with you?"

528
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,560
And it got even worse.
It got even worse

529
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,840
when they were joined by
none other than Martin Ssempa,

530
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,920
who turned up with
a bag full of vegetables

531
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,880
and a lot of questions.

532
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,520
They begin to use
gadgets like bananas.

533
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,080
They use carrots.
They use bananas.

534
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,720
They use cucumbers.

535
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,360
And add
the metalized ones.

536
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,040
And they put them
inside themselves.

537
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,440
These are the
instruments you use.

538
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,880
These are vegetables.

539
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,480
Uh-huh.

540
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,680
I eat this
on my plate.

541
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,600
Pepe Onziema is
the Gandhi of Uganda.

542
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,800
He's U-Gandhi.

543
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,960
And I am truly honored to say

544
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,000
that he is actually
joining us here this evening.

545
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:31,480
Please welcome
Pepe Julian Onziema.

546
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,760
Please, please.

547
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,520
Pepe.
Yes.

548
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,040
Thank you so,
so much for being here.

549
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,240
I guess my first
question has to be,

550
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,280
why are you gay?

551
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,600
No. No.

552
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,040
So, I just got that's
how all interviews

553
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,000
in Uganda started.

554
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,800
The key question is,
do you think

555
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,720
this law
would have happened

556
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,360
if it were not for
U.S. interference?

557
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,080
The answer is no.
It wouldn't have happened

558
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,400
if it wasn't for
U.S. influence.

559
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,400
Why I say that is
for very many years,

560
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,120
we've had
a penal code,

561
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,920
and we've done research
to find out

562
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,560
how many people have been
actually convicted

563
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,160
under the penal code
that we have.

564
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,000
And there's probably
just one case,

565
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,280
and the person did not
serve the sentence.

566
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,200
So, no.

567
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,880
But it's not about--
it's not about

568
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,880
whether the laws are
enacted, is it?

569
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,840
It's about
the incitement

570
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,960
of the hatred
around it.

571
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,080
In many ways, that can
do more physical damage

572
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,440
than the threat
of jail terms.

573
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,840
Absolutely.

574
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,880
Of course, with
the penal code,

575
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,200
many of us have suffered
under the penal--

576
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,960
you know,
just the way it is

577
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,920
presented to
the public,

578
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,560
many of us have suffered
from evictions,

579
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,960
beatings on the street, arbitrary arrests,
and so on.

580
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,920
However, that increased,

581
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,320
it changed
with your influence.

582
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,240
Oh, you're from
somewhere else.

583
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,240
Oh, I'm the double down.
You know,

584
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,840
I sowed that seed
as a British person

585
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,520
and now as someone
who lives in America,

586
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,560
I fertilized the fuck
out of that seed.

587
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,080
So, you're welcome, and
sorry on both counts.

588
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:36,080
Sorry doesn't cut it.

589
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,800
I love the fact
that we have just seen

590
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,760
incredible restraint
during that interview,

591
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,920
and it's with me
that you're going,

592
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,360
"Yeah, you need to say
fucking sorry."

593
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,760
So, so, are you
safe in Uganda?

594
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,120
I'm guessing the answer
to that is not really.

595
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,200
Is that true?

596
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,520
Not really.
I'm not exactly safe.

597
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,080
But to a certain extent
I'm safe

598
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,240
because I stand my ground,

599
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,880
that I'm not going
to change under fear.

600
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,040
I'm not going to run away
from the country.

601
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,840
And the fact that
you guys know about me

602
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,840
is a form of
protection for me.

603
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,880
I look over my
shoulder every day.

604
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,920
But there's not a place
I'd rather be than be there

605
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,880
and make sure that
the safety I need

606
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,320
actually happens
in the country.

607
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,480
That's just--I cannot
tell you how much--

608
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,080
I can't
tell you how much

609
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,720
I thank you
for being here

610
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,440
and how much I admire you for going
back to Uganda.

611
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,800
Can I drink some water?

612
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,960
Go for it.
Do you mind--

613
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,000
do you mind
sticking around

614
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,040
and we'll talk more on the web?
Is that OK?

615
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,560
Sure.
That would be great.

616
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,760
If you want to watch an extended
interview of this online,

617
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,320
please go down here.

618
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,720
My huge thanks to
Pepe Julian Onziema.

619
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,000
Have a great week.
We're off next week,

620
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,000
but we're back in two weeks.

621
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,040
Have a great week.
Good night!
