1
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,400
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight." I'm John Oliver.

2
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,560
Thanks for being with us.

3
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,600
Just time for a quick recap of the week--

4
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,800
spoiler alert--it's been fucking depressing again.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
It's been a very difficult time for diplomacy.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,800
In Gaza, the crisis continued.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,920
Over a thousand people have now been killed.

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,600
There were multiple cease-fires all week,

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,200
none of which have held.

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,280
One cease-fire was so short, it was technically

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,840
only a cease-f...

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,360
because fighting resumed before they could even finish

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,000
the fucking word.

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,800
It has all been enough
to make you wish

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,640
for some happier diplomatic news
here at home.

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,000
And, luckily,
I have some for you.

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,600
Because on Thursday, there was
a House hearing

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,600
about U.S./India relations.

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,680
And freshman Republican
Curt Clawson took a chance

20
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,720
to reach out to
the House's guests,

21
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,680
Nisha Biswal and Arun Kumar.

22
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,520
I went to school in Nagarjuna.

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,200
I know Jagapathi.

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,400
And these are my friends.

25
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,240
I love Hyderabad.
I love Chennai.

26
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,320
And I'm very familiar with
your country.

27
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,800
Ooh, very nice. I mean...

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
borderline offensive of
a pronunciation, but very nice.

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,640
Just one problem there.

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,400
The two people he's talking
to are

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,400
not from the Indian government.

32
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,000
They are Americans
from the State Department

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,000
and the Commerce Department.

34
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,160
Clawson seems to have been
led astray

35
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,600
by their misleadingly
brown faces.

36
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,240
However, he does not
know this yet.

37
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,960
So let's all sit back and enjoy

38
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,120
a slow moving car crash.

39
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,400
So just as your capital
is welcome here to produce

40
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,400
good-paying jobs in the U.S.,

41
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,240
I'd like our
capital to be welcome there

42
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,400
and there to
be freedom of capital

43
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,400
so that both sides
are on the same territory.

44
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,400
And I ask cooperation
and commitment and priority

45
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,200
from your government
in so doing.

46
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,800
Can I have that?

47
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,000
I think your question is
to the Indian government,

48
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
and we certainly share
your sentiments,

49
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,840
and we certainly
will advocate that

50
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,320
on behalf of
the U.S. gov--

51
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,280
CLAWSON: Of course.
OK, let's see some progress.

52
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

53
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,680
You do not get to pretend that
that did not just happen!

54
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,000
Because that was incredible.

55
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,840
And my favorite part of it--

56
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,840
other than absolutely
everything--

57
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,520
is Mr. Kumar, who is absolutely
loving the whole thing.

58
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,800
He's leaning
back in his chair going,

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,400
"Oh, this guy is awesome!

60
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,800
"Please nobody tell him.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,200
"I've got 10 bucks which says
he's about to compliment me

62
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,800
for my role
in "Slumdog Millionaire.""

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,600
"Ahh! Ooh."

64
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,200
Amazing. Ama--
We needed that.

65
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,640
In other news, there
was potentially horrifying news

66
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,920
about the behavior of ISIS
in northern Iraq.

67
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,000
The UN is attempting to verify
claims that ISIS has ordered

68
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,840
all women in one Iraqi city
to undergo genital mutilation.

69
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,680
That is truly horrific.

70
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,400
Or it would be, if it were
definitely true.

71
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,320
Thankfully, other reports
suggest it could be fake,

72
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,280
although I will say this
to ISIS:

73
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,800
The fact that that seems like
something you would do

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,400
still does not reflect
particularly well on you

75
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,920
as an organization.

76
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,400
It's like if someone told you
that Bravo created a spin-off

77
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,800
that's just dogs of housewives

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
or that Shia LaBeouf
defecated on a homeless man.

79
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,480
Neither of
those things happened,

80
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,200
but they sound like they could have done,

81
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,400
and that's still a problem
for all concerned.

82
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,400
And before everyone gets
too relieved that

83
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,600
female genital mutilation is not
being practiced by ISIS in Iraq,

84
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,880
it is worth remembering it is
still happening

85
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,600
in a shocking number of places,

86
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,200
including, as I learned for
the first time this week, Egypt,

87
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,600
where it happens at a 91% rate
among married women

88
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,760
aged 15 to 49.

89
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,080
That is appalling for Egypt

90
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,280
and absolutely amazing
for whoever it is who does

91
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,200
the branding for Egypt.

92
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,720
Because in light of that
statistic,

93
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,000
how are pyramids the first thing
we fucking think of?

94
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,000
Failing to mention
genital mutilation first

95
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,000
when you talk about Egypt is
like calling Rob Ford

96
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,280
"that Canadian guy

97
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,400
who famously fought
Toronto's fair wage policy"...

98
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,200
or referring to 9/11
as Harry Connick Jr.'s birthday.

99
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,880
And finally tonight, Thailand.

100
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,800
You may remember a few weeks
ago we talked a little

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,800
about Thailand's buffoonish
clown prince

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,600
and his miniature poodle called
Fu-Fu,

103
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,440
two things that I would argue
are objectively funny.

104
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,600
However, it turned out this week

105
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,960
that Thailand's aggressive
military government

106
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,240
may not agree with me.

107
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,200
John Oliver is upsetting
one government.

108
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Officials in Thailand
are worried

109
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,800
about Oliver's activities

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,880
and that he may be
a threat to its monarchy.

111
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,240
Oh, shit!

112
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,800
OK...OK...OK...

113
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,520
Whew. I will say...

114
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,160
I will say this...

115
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,240
if I can bring down your
monarchy,

116
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,800
you have
at best a wobbly monarchy.

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,800
Amazingly, this story
might actually be true.

118
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,320
A confidential Thai military
document focused

119
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,920
on overseas activities
that are

120
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,800
"undermining the royal
institution" was leaked.

121
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,440
And you'll notice
3 English words

122
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,800
in the middle of that page.

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,600
And, unfortunately, those words are "John William Oliver."

124
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,760
Uh...

125
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,880
And, yeah, I think deep down,
I always knew

126
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,800
that everyone would find out
my middle name

127
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,600
thanks to an angry Thai
military government.

128
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,560
Clearly there are
some big lessons

129
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,840
to be taken away from this.

130
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,600
One--it seems my Thailand
vacation is going to have to be

131
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,600
postponed very much indefinitely

132
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,880
and--two--this is all happening
because Thailand has

133
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,920
a lese-majeste law,

134
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,640
which can jail people
for insulting the monarchy,

135
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,600
which is stupid.

136
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,120
Other countries have this kind
of law, too.

137
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,000
And they're stupid, as well.

138
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,600
And if I'm not going to Thailand
anytime soon--

139
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,400
and apparently I'm not--let's
burn some more bridges, so...

140
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,800
working from a list...

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,920
working from a list
of countries that have

142
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,480
these laws: Hey, Netherlands,
how's Queen Beatrix doing?

143
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,200
By the way, the Dowager Countess
of Grantham would like

144
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,800
her face back.

145
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,080
Hey, Kuwait, what's up with
your current emir?

146
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,320
He looks looks like a police sketch of an evil walnut.

147
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,400
He looks like what you'd get

148
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,800
if Freddie Mercury
fucked a sea turtle.

149
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,440
OK. And finally, Denmark...

150
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,800
Now, I would offer not to make
fun of your Prince Henrik

151
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,120
were it not for the fact that
there is a video

152
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,200
of him getting
into a panda costume

153
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,440
and molesting people

154
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,880
while they're trying
to eat their dinner.

155
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,400
You are the Crown Prince
of Denmark.

156
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,000
You are already an endangered,
meaningless mascot

157
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,800
who exists mainly for people
to take photos with.

158
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Putting on a panda costume is
gilding the lily somewhat.

159
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,600
Your move, Denmark!

160
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,600
I await my Danish
prison sentence.

161
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,920
Please take me to
your impeccably furnished

162
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,600
birch wood cell.

163
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,800
I await my dinner of adorably
tiny, little cheeses.

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,600
And now this...

165
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,480
WOMAN: I'm gonna file this
next story

166
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,800
under "stories my producer is
making me do

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,240
that I don't agree with,"
but OK.

168
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,800
I know we're tired of
covering Miley Cyrus,

169
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,080
but we had to include

170
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,400
this final headline.

171
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,760
I didn't believe our
producers when we

172
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,760
first started
covering

173
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,760
the Rodman story.

174
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
I wish that he
becomes irrelevant

175
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,360
as soon as possible.

176
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,840
NEWSCASTER: There is breaking
news now on Fox News Channel--

177
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,960
It's not really that breaking.

178
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,400
I mean, everybody knew this
was gonna happen.

179
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,800
Even I knew this was
gonna happen.

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,200
Well, we saw
the obligatory

181
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,480
chopper aerials
of the Biebs.

182
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,760
He's pushing important
news off the front page.

183
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,760
It shouldn't even
be a story.

184
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,920
We shouldn't
even be covering it,

185
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,840
but that's not
the world we live in.

186
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,920
Why are we still talking
about Monica Lewinsky?

187
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,960
Why are we talking
about 2016?

188
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,440
What aspect of this
is newsworthy?

189
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,680
MAN: Should
we even give that

190
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,800
the credence
of covering it?

191
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,280
HOST: I just read it,
so I would say ye--

192
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,800
MAN: I know.

193
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,400
Moving on. Moving on.

194
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,920
Our main story tonight is

195
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,600
the threat
of nuclear annihilation.

196
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,160
It's probably been a while
since you've thought

197
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,160
about it, but there was a time
when people lived

198
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,200
in almost constant fear.

199
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,160
Children used to be shown this
in schools.

200
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,160
ANNOUNCER: Sundays,
holidays, vacation time,

201
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,880
we must be ready every day, all the time,

202
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,280
to do the right thing
if the atomic bomb explodes.

203
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,520
Duck and cover!

204
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,880
I will say this for the 1950s--

205
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,400
they had the perfect blend of
optimism and pessimism.

206
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,040
"The death blast is coming,
but we'll survive it

207
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,600
if we all get
under this picnic blanket."

208
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,600
Now, by the 1980s, attitudes
had changed.

209
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,360
The TV movie "The Day After"
had a slightly different tone.

210
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:36,320
See if you can spot it.

211
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,960
Danny! Don't
look at it!

212
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,600
Oh, my--

213
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
The worst thing is,
Danny would have been fine

214
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,600
if he'd just had
a picnic blanket with him.

215
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,800
What were you thinking,
you little fool?

216
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The strange thing is, all of
that seems so dated.

217
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,600
Nowadays,
we spend less time

218
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
worrying about
nuclear annihilation

219
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,760
than we do worrying about
whether we accidentally hit

220
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,000
"Reply all" on an office email.

221
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,160
"Oh, shit. Did I send that
to Dave?

222
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,800
I said "his face looks like
a ferret."

223
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,880
But maybe we should be worrying

224
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,880
about nuclear warheads
a bit more,

225
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,280
and not the ones in North Korea,
Iran, or Russia,

226
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,600
but the ones we have
here at home.

227
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,800
America has around 4,800
nuclear warheads,

228
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,800
which is more than enough
not just to destroy Earth,

229
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,920
but to provide 4th of July
fireworks for Martians.

230
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,800
Some of our most
powerful weapons are

231
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,760
intercontinental ballistic
missiles, ICBMs,

232
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,200
which is both an acronym

233
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,800
and what you would say
if you saw one coming at you.

234
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,840
That's a little joke for all you
gastroenterologists out there.

235
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,600
They are currently in silos
in Wyoming, Montana,

236
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,920
and North Dakota.

237
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,000
Let's start with Wyoming.

238
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,840
How well are we taking
care of these things?

239
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,320
REPORTER:
Take this enormous outer door

240
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,520
designed to protect the corridor
leading to the capsule.

241
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,960
They can't close it
because of a broken part,

242
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,760
so it's propped open
with a crowbar

243
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,920
and marked with a "danger" tag.

244
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,600
OK...

245
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,000
to be honest, repairs like that
are less appropriate

246
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,480
in a nuclear silo

247
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,400
than they are
in a divorced dad's condo.

248
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,000
"Why does the fridge open
with string, Daddy?"

249
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,000
And for the record--
for the record,

250
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,640
it's not just their hardware
that needs updating.

251
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,800
It's their software, too.

252
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,560
REPORTER:
The equipment is ancient.

253
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,880
This, for example, is one of
the computers that would receive

254
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,640
a launch order
from the president.

255
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,520
It uses floppy disks,

256
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,560
the really old, big ones.

257
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,200
Holy shit!

258
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,800
Those things barely
look powerful enough to run

259
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,320
Oregon Trail...

260
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,200
much less Earth-ending weaponry.

261
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,200
People who work there must watch
"WarGames" and go,

262
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,600
"One day! One day we'll
get to play with that stuff."

263
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,400
Look, fingers crossed,

264
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,000
things are a little better
in North Dakota.

265
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,920
Seventeen Air Force officers
are being relieved

266
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,160
of their duties controlling
nuclear missiles.

267
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,600
REPORTER: An inspection in March
tested the group's

268
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,680
missile launch proficiency.

269
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,600
They were rated as marginal,

270
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,880
the equivalent of earning

271
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,440
a D grade. Barely passing.

272
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,000
That's not great.

273
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,880
I do really think when it comes
to safeguarding

274
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,800
the deadliest objects ever known
to mankind, we should really

275
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,200
insist on something more
in a solid B-plus/C-minus range.

276
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,800
OK, finally let's look
at Montana.

277
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,800
The good news--their offices
have not had D grades.

278
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,240
The bad news is why.

279
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,800
Thirty-four U.S. Air Force
nuclear launch officers

280
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,320
have been stripped of their
certification.

281
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,040
REPORTER: Four months ago,
a launch officer

282
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,600
at Malmstrom Air Force Base
in Montana allegedly texted

283
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,960
the answers to
a monthly proficiency test

284
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,840
to other officers at the base.

285
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,200
They texted the answers!

286
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,600
Those answers should not
be textable.

287
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
You should not be able
to answer, "How do you prevent

288
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,600
the launch of a Minuteman III?,"

289
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,400
with emojis.

290
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,800
It has to be more complicated
than that.

291
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,200
But, OK, OK, look, let's not
overreact.

292
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,800
Now, not everyone is good
at tests.

293
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,880
How are the people
in North Dakota and Montana

294
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,960
working in the field?

295
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,760
REPORTER: Picture this--
4 Air Force officers

296
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,840
who hold the launch keys
to nuclear missiles

297
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,800
leaving open the blast door
that's supposed to prevent

298
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,080
terrorists from entering
the capsule.

299
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,080
This while another slept inside,
which is allowed

300
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,160
only if the door is closed.

301
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,520
And who discovered this?

302
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,960
In one case,
it was a maintenance team.

303
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,800
In another case,
it was discovered

304
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,600
by someone
delivering food.

305
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,760
And once again, America
is saved from destruction

306
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,000
by the heroes in Meal Team 6.

307
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,800
And in case you think it's just
low-level, unmotivated officers

308
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,200
who are dropping the ball here,
let's meet two of the top people

309
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,680
who've been in charge of
our most powerful missiles.

310
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,800
First up,
Major General Michael Carey.

311
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,200
He was relieved of command
last October

312
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,560
for spectacular reasons.

313
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,720
REPORTER: According to
an Air Force inspector general's

314
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,760
report, on a recent
trip to Russia,

315
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,600
Air Force General Michael Carey
was often intoxicated, rude,

316
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,680
and spent a lot of time
with foreign women.

317
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,600
He often
interrupted presentations.

318
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,600
He often interrupted translators
with annoying comments

319
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
when he gave toasts...

320
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,680
That really irritated
the Russians.

321
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Just think about that.

322
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,800
The man overseeing our ICBMs
was too drunk for the Russians.

323
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
For the Russians!

324
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,600
And CNN barely skimmed
the surface of this story.

325
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,160
The inspector general's report

326
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,600
reads like
"Ron Burgundy Goes to Russia."

327
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,000
Apparently, General Carey at
one point tried to fist-bump

328
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,400
a confused Russian tour guide,

329
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,800
then dragged his staff to
a restaurant called La Cantina

330
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,400
because he, and I quote,

331
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,800
"really wanted to see
this Beatles cover band,"

332
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,800
prompting one staffer
to observe,

333
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,560
"I wouldn't pick a Mexican place
to go in Russia,

334
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,600
but all right, if that's where
he wants to go, we'll go there."

335
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,000
And even once he was there,
it wasn't over.

336
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,960
Because he again, and I quote,
"was really intent on singing

337
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,520
with the band."

338
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,800
And he said, "Go ask them if
I can play guitar,"

339
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
which led to the immortal
sentence,

340
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,200
"I told the General
that basically, um, you know,

341
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,200
that he can't,
he can't play the guitars."

342
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,200
Take a moment to consider
the run of poor decisions

343
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,800
that are required before you're
being told you can't play guitar

344
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,600
with a Beatles cover band
when you're drunk

345
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,800
at a Mexican restaurant
in Russia.

346
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,920
Just add all that up
together.

347
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,960
And then consider,
this man had access

348
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,400
to our deadliest
nuclear warheads.

349
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,120
And in case that doesn't scare
you enough,

350
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,600
until recently one of the men overseeing

351
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
all the people we've
met so far

352
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,800
was Vice Admiral Tim Giardina.

353
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,040
The president relieved him of
his command last year

354
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,360
for an even weirder reason.

355
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,760
REPORTER: Admiral
Timothy Giardina's undoing began

356
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,600
with a local
criminal investigation in Iowa,

357
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,960
where he was spotted
on surveillance cameras using

358
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,800
counterfeit poker chips

359
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
at the Horseshoe Casino
in Council Bluffs.

360
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,880
OK, OK, I'm sorry,
but a vice admiral has to have

361
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,560
the mental fortitude to fool
an Iowa pit boss. You have to.

362
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,880
You have to.

363
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,560
And, also, this means--
let's recap--

364
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,520
that within the last 12 months,
we were in a situation

365
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,600
where in the event of
us launching a nuclear strike,

366
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,320
the president's command
would theoretically have gone

367
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,400
through a man gambling
with fake poker chips,

368
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,800
who would have then tried
to call a drunk guy

369
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,400
wrestling with
a Russian George Harrison,

370
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,040
who would have then needed
to send someone

371
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,800
with a bag full of burritos to
wake up an officer

372
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,640
and tell him to go grab
an LP-sized floppy disc

373
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,000
and begin the solemn process of
ending the world as we know it.

374
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,000
Just...

375
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,800
And if...

376
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,560
if you're thinking, "Well,
it looks like we were lucky

377
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,200
nothing terrible has happened,"

378
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,680
we're actually even luckier
than you think.

379
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,800
Over the years, America has had
some pretty terrifying

380
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,920
almost-geddons.

381
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,800
The Goldsboro incident of 1961--

382
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,560
that's when a U.S. B-52
bomber jet broke in half

383
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,400
during a flight and lost
its load--two nuclear bombs.

384
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,080
Where was it flying at the time?
Over the city of Goldsboro,

385
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,280
North Carolina.

386
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,600
Both bombs plummeted
to the ground.

387
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,960
One was nearly armed,

388
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,600
set to explode,

389
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,120
but miraculously, neither did.

390
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,600
Yeah, you dropped
an armed nuclear bomb

391
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,000
on your own country.

392
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,800
And it is, frankly, amazing

393
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,800
that you don't talk
about that more often.

394
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,920
There is genuinely a weirdly
restrained sign marking

395
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,720
the event, calling it
a "nuclear mishap,"

396
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,560
when it clearly should
really say,

397
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,200
"Holy Fuck! You have no idea
what nearly happened here!"

398
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,800
And--I know...

399
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,280
I know you're probably thinking,

400
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,720
"OK, all right. We nearly blew
up one of the Carolinas,

401
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,320
but that's basically why we
have two."

402
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,640
But--but in that case, how about
that one time we risked

403
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,800
blowing up Arkansas?

404
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,800
Someone dropped a socket
in the silo.

405
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,600
And the socket fell
about 70 feet,

406
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,200
pierced the missile,
caused a fuel leak.

407
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,840
And then there was
a huge explosion.

408
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,880
Just think about the system
we have designed.

409
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,200
In the rock/paper/scissors
logic,

410
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,800
socket beats nuclear missile.

411
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,720
And if that feels too much
like ancient history to you,

412
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,040
here is something from
as recently as 2007.

413
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,320
REPORTER: Six nuclear-tipped
cruise missiles

414
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,800
were loaded onto a B-52
by mistake,

415
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,200
flown across the country,

416
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,920
and left unguarded
on the Tarmac.

417
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,840
No one noticed for 36 hours.

418
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,920
And that must have been a hell
of a moment when they realized,

419
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,840
"Hey, guys, um, those things
that have been out there

420
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,360
"for a day and a half, there is
no way that those are nuclear--

421
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,200
Shit!"

422
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,400
It seems clear at this point, we
have too many nuclear weapons

423
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,840
to take care of them properly.

424
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,200
So why aren't we reducing them?

425
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,800
Well, we were, to be fair.

426
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,600
Since 1988, we got rid of more
than 18,000 warheads,

427
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,040
but recently, things
have slowed down a lot.

428
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,800
President Obama has reduced
our arsenal by just 309,

429
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,280
which is crazy.

430
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,000
At a time of budgetary cutbacks,
we are spending $355 billion

431
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,880
over the next decade
on something we don't need.

432
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,200
And don't take that from me.

433
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,960
Take it from someone
who actually knows

434
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,680
something about this.

435
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,400
The one thing I
convinced myself of

436
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,680
after all these
years of exposure

437
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,520
to the use of
nuclear weapons is

438
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,800
that they were
useless.

439
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,400
Yeah. Nuclear weapons are
basically like Americans'

440
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,800
"T. rex" arms.

441
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,960
They're essentially useless,

442
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,200
and you are plenty scary enough
without them.

443
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,200
When you have...

444
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,000
when you have 4,800 of something
you don't need,

445
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,400
you are a fucking hoarder
at that point.

446
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,000
It's like having 4,800 cats.

447
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,280
Sure, each one might have made
sense when you got it,

448
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,240
but it all happened
so gradually,

449
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,960
you didn't really notice that
things had gotten out of hand.

450
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,200
And now you have too many

451
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,800
of these agents of chaos
and destruction.

452
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,800
And one of these days,
one of them might kill you.

453
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,880
The problem is there are
two key things stopping us

454
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,600
from reducing
our nuclear weapons.

455
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,880
The first is politics.

456
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,720
Because there are lawmakers from
both parties who have

457
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,960
missile silos in their states.

458
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,120
And they will fight any attempt
to close them,

459
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,200
no matter how much sense
that makes.

460
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,600
And they'll fight it with ironclad logic like this...

461
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,400
We know that maintaining
our current silos is the best

462
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,400
interest--and in the best
interest of taxpayers

463
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,600
because rebuilding them
would be very expensive.

464
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
OK, let me get that straight.

465
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,400
You are spending money
on something you don't need

466
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,240
in the hopes that you'll be
saving money

467
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,920
on the off chance one day
you eventually do need...

468
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,960
What exactly
are you saying, then?

469
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,280
That's desperate.

470
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,920
That's like saying,
"I have to hold on

471
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,880
"to my storage facility
full of Aquaman action figures

472
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,880
on the off chance that my
future wife really likes them."

473
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,800
She will not. She will not!

474
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
She will not want those things.

475
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,000
"You don't need them!"

476
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,120
The man there,
that's Steve Daines.

477
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,400
And the House was discussing
a bill that guaranteed

478
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,200
that silos would be kept open
until at least 2021.

479
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,320
He was trying to attach
an amendment

480
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,400
removing
the end date altogether,

481
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,840
essentially meaning, no matter
what the Pentagon wanted,

482
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,920
the silos would have to be
kept open forever.

483
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,040
It was clearly
a ridiculous amendment.

484
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,280
Let's now watch it pass.

485
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,800
MAN: On this vote, the yeas

486
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,400
are 222; the nays are 196.

487
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,560
The amendment is adopted.

488
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,000
That is some weapons grade
bullshit.

489
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,680
Now, the Senate could still make
big changes to that bill.

490
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,000
But for that to happen,
people would need to care.

491
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,680
And that brings us to
the main reason why so little is

492
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,200
being done to reduce our number
of nuclear warheads.

493
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,000
Deep down, people just don't
give enough of a shit anymore.

494
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,640
In the 1980s,
hundreds of thousands of people

495
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,000
pushed for disarmament
in Central Park.

496
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,560
But in May of this year,
this is what a House hearing

497
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,240
on nuclear security looks like.

498
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,080
We should point out probably
one of the few hearings

499
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,280
in which, actually,
the attendance

500
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,880
of the subcommittee compares
very favorably

501
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,840
with the attendance
in the audience.

502
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,200
Because the public has not
tuned in to these issues

503
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,760
as they should.

504
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,200
That's right.

505
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,600
A hearing on the most dangerous
things on Earth had

506
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:05,000
attendance rivaling that of
a weekday open mike poetry slam.

507
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,000
And the problem is,
no one honestly believes

508
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,400
that we're going to destroy
ourselves

509
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,480
despite the fact that

510
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,720
that has nearly happened
multiple times.

511
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,960
But shouldn't we, at the very
least, be reducing our stockpile

512
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,800
down to a number where
we can look after them properly

513
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,600
with enough qualified people,

514
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,000
none of whom are going
to cheat on a test,

515
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,560
leave a door open, or vomit
a half-eaten chimichanga

516
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,200
onto a Slavic Ringo?

517
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,840
All I'm saying is, if humanity
is going to be destroyed

518
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,800
by a nuclear weapon,

519
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,200
let's make sure
that it's at least intentional.

520
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,480
Let's have it be
a U.S. president

521
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,920
riding a missile
with a middle finger

522
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,200
held to the sky,

523
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,920
screaming humanity's last words:
"Fuck you, world!

524
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,800
America is shutting
this shit down."

525
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Please...

526
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,800
let's just not have our
last words be, "Oops. Oh, shit."

527
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,080
And now this...

528
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,200
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

529
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,000
Who's got the camera?

530
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,640
Who let the dogs out?
Who? Who?

531
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,200
MAN: I deserve to be paid more.

532
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,360
And I'm only a freshman,
and I'm already complaining.

533
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,400
Show me the money.

534
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,160
Show me the money.

535
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,800
As George Costanza would say
when they're applauding,

536
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,360
"Stop right now," right?

537
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,200
That takes me back to another
modern-day poet

538
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
by the name of Jay-Z.

539
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
In one of his songs, he wrote:

540
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,400
"It's funny what 7 days
can change.

541
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,000
It was all good just
a week ago."

542
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,480
MAN: I've been
the original cosponsor

543
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,600
of this bill ever since I got
here to Congress.

544
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,200
If I can quote L.L. Cool J,
the rapper,

545
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,400
"Don't call it a comeback.
I've been here for years."

546
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,280
DIFFERENT MAN: This may go back to "A Few Good Men," the movie

547
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,800
with Jack Nicholson.

548
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,600
"You can't handle the truth."

549
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,360
WOMAN: But struggling
Nevada families are asking,

550
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,200
"Where's the beef?"

551
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,080
ROMNEY: I was thinking about
Davy Crockett.

552
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,240
Remember the song?

553
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,760
"Born on a mountaintop in
Tennessee.

554
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,800
Greenest state in the land
of the free.

555
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,800
Raised in the woods so he knew
every tree.

556
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,800
And he kills himself a bear
when he was only 3.

557
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,120
Davy, Davy Crocket...

558
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,800
Finally...

559
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,920
That guy has his finger on
the pulse.

560
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,000
Finally tonight, look, I know
that in the last few weeks,

561
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,160
we've been covering a lot of
depressing stories.

562
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,120
But I'm afraid I have one more
terrible tale to tell you.

563
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,280
Russia has lost contact
with a satellite

564
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,680
full of possibly mating geckos.

565
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,800
Russia launched the geckos into
space about a week ago.

566
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,880
They were trying to observe
their mating activities

567
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,200
in zero gravity.

568
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,800
But after just a few orbits,
their pod stopped responding

569
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
to mission control.

570
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,000
Don't you dare laugh at that!

571
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,600
Don't--don't you dare laugh

572
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,040
at the fact that Russia
has lost a satellite

573
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,800
full of sexually-active
space geckos.

574
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,800
There is nothing funny
about that!

575
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,920
This is like "Apollo 13"
all over again,

576
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,760
only in Cyrillic

577
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,880
and with a quintet
of Russian fuck lizards

578
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,040
instead of Tom Hanks.

579
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,920
And, frankly, Russia has
not been treating this story

580
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,200
with the urgency it deserves.

581
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
REPORTER: Russia's hoping
to restore communications

582
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,400
before the geckos
run out of food.

583
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,800
"Hoping"?

584
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,360
That is not good enough, Russia.

585
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,200
You can't just watch videos of
them fucking

586
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,440
and then toss them aside.

587
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,600
They're not Kardashians.

588
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,200
And, look, look...

589
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,600
they're geckos.

590
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
And, look, you might be saying,

591
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,440
"John, why are you making such
a big deal out of this?

592
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,600
Aren't there more important
things going on in the world?"

593
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,880
Well, yes, obviously.

594
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,920
Almost everything is more
important than this.

595
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,600
Ukraine is sliding into anarchy;

596
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,360
the Gaza cease-fire is tenuous;

597
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,000
and we're mostly powerless
to do anything

598
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,480
about any of them.

599
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,760
But maybe, just maybe, if we
could come together

600
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,520
and accomplish
one thing as a civilization,

601
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,720
we could then build on that
progress.

602
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,800
And I think rescuing
these space sex geckos

603
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,280
might just be that thing.

604
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,680
And that is why I'm issuing
a challenge to humanity:

605
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,600
Go get those geckos.

606
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,800
Now, I know what
you're thinking.

607
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,120
I know what you're thinking.

608
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,160
"John, how is a hashtag
going to rescue those geckos?"

609
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,800
The hashtag is to raise
awareness, you idiots!

610
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Be positive!

611
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,080
And, look, you can
and should do more.

612
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,440
You could go on to the Kremlin's
contact page,

613
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,800
which inexplicably has a form
allowing you

614
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,280
to actually write Vladimir Putin
a letter,

615
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,600
which you can do
at this address.

616
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,800
And, look, look,
take this seriously.

617
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,800
Don't be idiots about this.

618
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,800
The Kremlin insists--
this is true--

619
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,800
that your suggestions be,
and I quote, "specific."

620
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And I do not know of
a more specific suggestion

621
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,200
than "Go get those geckos!"

622
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,600
How are we gonna do it?
What's that?

623
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,800
How are we gonna get them?
I don't know. I don't know.

624
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,800
I'm not a space pornographer.

625
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,400
Maybe a net of some sort
or a magnet. I don't know.

626
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,200
Maybe you've got
some better ideas.

627
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,600
And if you do, don't tell me.

628
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,240
Tell Vladimir Putin at this
address.

629
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,720
We can do this, people.

630
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,360
And, sure, Russia's gonna push
back, like they did yesterday,

631
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,960
saying they've reestablished
contact with the satellite.

632
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,920
But they're clearly lying.

633
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,120
They're just buying Putin enough
time to run to a pet store,

634
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,920
get 5 geckos, and parade them
in front of us.

635
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,840
Well, we don't want
those geckos!

636
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,600
We want the space geckos!

637
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,840
Come on, humanity.

638
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,400
Let us stand together as one,

639
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,360
and let us utter the most
powerful words

640
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,320
in the English language,

641
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,280
"Mr. Putin,
go get those geckos"!

642
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,800
That's our show.
Thanks so much for watching.

643
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,720
We'll be back next week,

644
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,800
and, God willing, so will
the geckos. Good night!

645
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,880
Go get those geckos!

646
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,480
Go get those geckos.

647
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,040
Go get those geckos!

648
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,480
Go get those geckos.

649
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,240
Go get those geckos!

650
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,800
Go get those geckos!

651
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,760
We'll get those geckos.

652
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,800
We will get those
geckos for you.

653
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,400
Get those geckos!

654
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,760
Get the geckos!

655
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,400
Go get the geckos!

656
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Get the geckos!

657
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,920
Get the...

658
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,520
Get the geckos.
Get the geckos.

659
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,920
Geckos!

660
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,200
Listen, we want
those geckos.

661
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:41,600
Go get the geckos!
