1
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,720
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight."

2
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,880
I'm John Oliver.

3
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,560
Just time for a quick recap of the week,

4
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,960
a week in which we collectively freaked the fuck out

5
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,160
over Ebola, but instead of talking

6
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,680
about all the hysteria and the misreporting,

7
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,040
let's just take a moment to focus on the incredible actions

8
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,440
of health care workers from Doctors Without Borders

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,880
in West Africa

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,680
to Dallas nurse Nina Pham,

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,840
who helped treat the first victim diagnosed

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,120
in America and in doing so contracted Ebola herself.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,920
She's in hospital right now, and this week,

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,120
she released a statement.

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,560
Holy shit.

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,240
She caught Ebola while
helping people,

17
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,520
and her first reaction is
to write a thank-you note.

18
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,240
I find that excessively polite,
and I'm British.

19
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,760
Because let me tell you,
if I were in her position,

20
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,320
this would be my statement.

21
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,760
Ahem.

22
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,240
"Fuck this disease
and the fucking fruit bats

23
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,200
"who probably
gave it to us,

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,000
"and to whoever is
responsible for whatever

25
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,800
"equipment or safety lapse
that led to my infection,

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,160
"I will lose my last breath
to cough Ebola straight

27
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,920
"into your incompetent mouths.

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,000
"Hugs and kisses,
John Oliver.

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,600
P.S. I hope those kisses
give you double Ebola!"

30
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,880
But let's--

31
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,640
let's not talk about Ebola.

32
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,040
Let's just talk
about last Thursday.

33
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,480
How was yours?

34
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,760
Because the only thing
I can remember from it

35
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,840
is the last 3 seconds of
"How To Get Away With Murder."

36
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,000
Why is your penis on
a dead girl's phone?

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,800
The only acceptable
answer to that question

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,960
is "That's not my penis."

39
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,880
That's the only OK response,
but I will tell you,

40
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,920
though, who had
the most spectacular

41
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,560
Thursday of anyone
on Earth--Vladimir Putin.

42
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,080
Now it started
pretty normally for him

43
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,120
with the publication
of an interview in which he

44
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,560
accused the U.S.
of blackmail, followed

45
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,120
by a military parade
in Belgrade featuring

46
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,880
Serbian soldiers
in full camouflage.

47
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,840
Although I will say
the only way that

48
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,080
that camouflage is going
to work is if they are going

49
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,600
to war inside
Steven Tyler's closet,

50
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,720
but still--still nothing
out of the ordinary

51
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,600
for Putin yet, other than
that it caused him to

52
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,760
arrive extremely late
to dinner in Milan.

53
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,920
MAN: Mr. Putin arrived fashionably late,

54
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,200
you could say,
for a gala dinner in Milan,

55
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,880
his first formal meeting
with European leaders

56
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,280
since June.

57
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,280
Look at everybody watching
him approach late.

58
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,280
That is a dickish
way to walk in.

59
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,240
That is one step short
of bursting in wearing

60
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,360
mirrored sunglasses
whilst this plays.

61
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,760
Did somebody order
a white Russian?

62
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,320
Now unfortunately--
unfortunately--

63
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,720
unfortunately,
this made him even later

64
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,560
to a meeting
with Angela Merkel,

65
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,920
which then didn't finish
until 1:30 in the morning,

66
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,880
and all the orange juice
and Pellegrino in the world

67
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,360
is not going to
make that OK.

68
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,040
And Putin still wasn't done.

69
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,960
MAN: He met with Merkel
till 1:30 in the morning.

70
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,440
Then he still had
enough energy to go

71
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,880
to Silvio Berlusconi's villa.

72
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:58,200
He was at Berlusconi's
villa until 3:30 A.M.,

73
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,520
where they shared a late-night meal that included

74
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,920
white truffles
and tiramisu.

75
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,360
You have got to hand it
to the Vladimir Putin

76
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,000
because the single most
disgustingly decadent

77
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,040
thing a human being can
possibly do is to eat

78
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,800
truffles and tiramisu
with Silvio Berlusconi

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,880
in Milan at 3 A.M.

80
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,800
What a Thursday!

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,520
What a Thursday!

82
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,600
And finally, finally,
it was also a big week

83
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,120
for McDonald's, makers
of the world's most

84
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,480
affordable heart disease.

85
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,680
It's the restaurant
whose logo represents

86
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,800
the two massive spikes
in blood pressure you'll

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,480
experience after eating there,
but they rolled

88
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,080
out a bold new ad
campaign this week called

89
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,000
"Our food.
Your questions."

90
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,240
All right, McDonald's.
Um, what sort

91
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,480
of breakfast hours?

92
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,360
Does McDonald's
even sell real food?

93
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,200
What part of the chicken
is a chicken nugget?

94
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,560
What's in your
chicken nuggets?

95
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,800
The pink slime,
what's up with that?

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,920
MAN: How much do you
care about the people

97
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,880
that eat your food?

98
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,560
OK. Interesting technique, and to be fair,

99
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,880
they're not just
collecting questions

100
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,920
from a recording device
that makes you look like

101
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,920
a vagrant getting into
an argument with a poster.

102
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,200
They're also answering
them on their web site

103
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,160
and in a series
of videos featuring a guy

104
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,920
from "MythBusters."

105
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm Grant Imahara,
and I've spent years

106
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,800
finding the truth.

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,840
Now I'm going
across America to find out

108
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,200
how McDonald's makes
its food.

109
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,720
So ask your questions,
and I'll find the answers.

110
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,720
Yeah. I've got a question.

111
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,880
Why the fuck are
you doing this?

112
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,840
Uh, please round up your
answer to the nearest dollar,

113
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,040
but I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

114
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,000
You were independently
investigating the company

115
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,960
paying you to conduct
an independent investigation.

116
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,200
IMAHARA:
So you know what?

117
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,600
I've been through
the whole process.

118
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,200
I know exactly what goes into this
all-beef patty.

119
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,360
Yep.

120
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,600
There's no fillers,
no preservatives,

121
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,400
no additives.

122
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,840
It's all beef, and there's
no pink slime.

123
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,880
That's good.
Yeah?

124
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,880
That's really good.

125
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
Nice!

126
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,280
There's something a little suspicious

127
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,960
about the way they're
celebrating the fact that

128
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,920
their food is made
out of food,

129
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,440
but the questions people
have about McDonald's go

130
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,080
way beyond just their food.

131
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,320
So yesterday, we put our
own McDonald's question board

132
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,280
up here in New York City.

133
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,840
Here are some
of the results.

134
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,200
Hello, McDonald's?

135
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,560
What's up, McDonald's?

136
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,720
What's up, Mickey D's!

137
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,520
How the fuck does
this pay stub

138
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,840
for a single mother who's worked
at a Chicago McDonald's

139
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,800
for 7 years show that her
take-home pay for, what, more

140
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,400
than 40 hours of work
is only $292.52?

141
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,840
Is there somebody
in there? Hello?

142
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,200
Why is my face like this?

143
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,520
Hello?

144
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,040
Am I a serial killer?

145
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,840
Because I look like I
could very easily be

146
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,320
a serial killer.

147
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,280
Why are there currently
7 lawsuits against

148
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,840
McDonald's and franchise
operators alleging wage theft?

149
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,120
And why do these
allegations include

150
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,400
failure to pay overtime,
forcing off-the-clock work,

151
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,160
and engaging in
a practice of managerial

152
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,200
alteration of time records?

153
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,480
Please tell me
this is cow blood.

154
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,640
It's not!

155
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,640
Stupid Ron, stupid Ron!

156
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,960
Moving on, moving on,
and let me warn you.

157
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,120
Our main story tonight
is going to end with you

158
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,520
getting extremely
angry at a donkey.

159
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,520
That might not make
sense right now,

160
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,400
but it is going to,
so let's begin.

161
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,960
Translation.

162
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,320
We've all seen
the comic ways

163
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,960
in which it can go wrong.

164
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,960
The Chinese signs
that say things like

165
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,720
"Do drunken driving"

166
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,160
or "Fuck vegetables."

167
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,040
I mean, but to be fair,
yes, that's a silly sign,

168
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,640
but at the same time,
fuck vegetables.

169
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,760
Am I right? Am I right?

170
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,360
Or--or maybe you've seen
the YouTube videos where

171
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,720
people put songs
like "Let It Go"

172
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,800
into Google Translate,
then translate them

173
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,400
back into English
and sing the results.

174
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,320
I've got to say,
that would be an amazing tone

175
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,680
for the "Frozen" sequel--
a bitter woman warbling

176
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,600
about defeat
in a radioactive ice castle.

177
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,280
I'm in! I am in!

178
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,800
Look. Bad translation
can be a lot of fun

179
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,840
when the stakes are low,
but if you're in a war zone,

180
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,800
accurate translation
can be the difference

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,840
between life and death,
and over the last decade,

182
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,960
good local interpreters
in Afghanistan and Iraq

183
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,120
have saved countless
American lives.

184
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,320
Let me show you
an Afghani man named Srosh

185
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:48,920
translating a warning
about some IEDs.

186
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,160
SROSH: He says
that "there is IEDs.

187
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,120
"Someone told me
that there is IEDs

188
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
in the street."

189
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,160
OK. Thank you.

190
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,760
OK. You see, that is
a good message

191
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,680
to get exactly right.

192
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,120
You don't want someone
saying, "Oh, to be

193
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,960
"honest, my Pashto's
a little shaky,

194
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,760
"but there's either
an IED or an IKEA

195
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,800
"behind those
rocks somewhere.

196
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,240
"Also, I think he
said something

197
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,760
"about fuck vegetables.

198
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,120
I think."

199
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,120
Ask any veteran,
and they will tell you that

200
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,600
translators risked their
own lives working for us,

201
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,160
and because they did that,
they are permanent

202
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,920
targets for insurgents.

203
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,960
Here's what the translator
you just saw--

204
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,320
Srosh--has been
up to lately.

205
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,200
You're probably
thinking right now,

206
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,360
"Well, we need to
move heaven and earth

207
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,280
"to get that man
and his family and bring

208
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,720
them to safety,"

209
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,960
and the fact that we are not
is what this story is

210
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,720
about because Srosh,
like a shocking number

211
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,040
of interpreters,
has applied for a visa,

212
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,040
but it's stuck
in bureaucratic limbo,

213
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,480
and the crazy thing is
there is absolutely no

214
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,920
good reason for that.

215
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,160
Congress passed bills
in 2008 and 2009

216
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,080
providing thousands
of special immigrant visas

217
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,760
for local nationals who
worked with the U.S. military,

218
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,960
but despite huge demand,
very few were issued.

219
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,480
For instance, through
the Afghanistan bill,

220
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,920
we could have given out
up to 1,500 visas a year.

221
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,600
Guess how many we
gave out in 2011.

222
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,600
It was 3.

223
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,360
The number of visas
for Afghanis who risked their

224
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,640
lives for us should not
be so low that relatively

225
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,400
stupid toddlers
can count up to it

226
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,800
or relatively
intelligent horses.

227
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,680
"1, 2--shouldn't it
be more than this--3."

228
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,960
Now to be fair, things
have improved slightly

229
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,440
recently thanks in part
to pressure from groups

230
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,560
like The List Project
and IRAP,

231
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,360
but it is still not moving
nearly fast enough.

232
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,800
Help us understand just
how difficult it is

233
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,800
for Afghans who worked
with U.S. forces to get

234
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,280
these special visas.

235
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,880
It's next to impossible.

236
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,920
I would say it's akin
to literally

237
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,640
winning the lottery.

238
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,840
Yeah, but it should not
be like a lottery,

239
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,120
where the odds are terrible.

240
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,440
These people risked
their lives for us.

241
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,960
It should be more like
a Little League award ceremony

242
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,920
where everyone's
a winner because they're

243
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,840
all an important part
of the fucking team.

244
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,520
Now...

245
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,400
there are--

246
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,680
there are currently
thousands of interpreters

247
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,120
with visa applications pending,

248
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,080
and if you're wondering
whose fault this is,

249
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,080
the State Department has
a surprising answer.

250
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,960
MAN, VOICE-OVER: Jarrett Blanc
is a deputy special

251
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,600
representative for
Afghanistan and Pakistan

252
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,960
at the State Department.

253
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,760
He blames some of the delays
on the applicants themselves.

254
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,440
A lot of those
people are actually--

255
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,600
maybe not quite half
of them are--

256
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,280
control their own
timing essentially.

257
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,920
So they've started
the application,

258
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,280
or perhaps they've gotten through
the first step,

259
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,920
but they need to finish their
own paperwork

260
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,400
before we can take
the next step with them.

261
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Ho ho ho!

262
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,760
That is some first-class
victim blaming.

263
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,600
You are on the edge
of saying, "Well, look.

264
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,960
"Maybe the Taliban
wouldn't be following

265
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,040
"them around if these
translators weren't

266
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,400
"dressed so slutty.

267
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,320
Have you thought
about that?"

268
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,880
But since he brings up
the paperwork, let's just

269
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,800
take a look at it
because applying for

270
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,520
a Special Immigrant Visa is
a 14-step process,

271
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,040
which is a lot.

272
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,520
Bear in mind that even
getting off heroin

273
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,320
only takes 12.

274
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,800
OK. So are you
ready for this shit?

275
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,240
Let's do it because
first, first you've got

276
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,480
your DS-157 form.

277
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,280
This contains all your
basic information.

278
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,320
It also needs to come
with a verification

279
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,840
of employment letter
from an HR director,

280
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,720
as well as a letter
of recommendation

281
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,800
from a direct supervisor.

282
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,280
Now if you can't find
your former supervisor,

283
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,080
which is entirely
possible, don't worry.

284
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,400
You just need a DS-158
supervisor locator form,

285
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,400
although that will only
work if your supervisor

286
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,000
was directly employed
by the military.

287
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
If they were
a contractor, which they

288
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
probably were, you're
shit out of luck.

289
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,360
You will also need
to submit a proof

290
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
of nationality form
and a copy of your

291
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,720
employee badge because no one
has ever lost one of those,

292
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,600
and once you've filled
all of this in,

293
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,000
you simply submit it
for approval and then wait

294
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,160
for anything between
a few months and a few years,

295
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,280
and if you're approved,
then congratulations

296
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,920
because you are
at the petition stage.

297
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,960
For this, you are going
to need your I-360 form,

298
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,800
which is basically the DS-157 form
all over again. *

299
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,920
Oh, and, uh, remember
to bring that to your

300
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,280
interview at the U.S. embassy,
although in Afghanistan--

301
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,400
funny story--they're not
scheduling those

302
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,880
at the moment partly
because the system's

303
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,960
so backed up and partly
because this whole program

304
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,840
is set to expire
at the end of the year

305
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,520
for no fucking reason
whatsoever.

306
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,240
At this stage, you as
a translator may feel

307
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:07,320
a little like this.

308
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,800
But don't, don't because
there is light

309
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,240
at the end of the tunnel.

310
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,560
Well, not light so much
as the DS-260 form!

311
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,880
And this little
beauty contains such

312
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,320
questions as...

313
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,400
To which I'm guess
your answer is,

314
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,360
"Ooh. To be honest,
my main plan was to

315
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,840
"not get killed
by the Taliban.

316
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,400
"I hadn't really worked
out a plan of attack

317
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,040
for my sex life yet."

318
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,320
But don't worry,
don't worry.

319
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,880
Don't worry.

320
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,960
Don't worry because after
all this paperwork,

321
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,280
plus, of course,
a visa interview,

322
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,080
a medical examination,
a security clearance,

323
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,400
and paying out
of pocket for passports,

324
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,280
vaccinations,
and your own plane tickets,

325
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,360
you get to come to America

326
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,880
or, as one translator
discovered, not.

327
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,400
And this is
9 months ago.

328
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
So what's the problem?

329
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,640
What the fuck?

330
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,600
By now, the ghost
of Franz Kafka is thinking,

331
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,880
"Don't you dare call
this Kafkaesque.

332
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,400
I don't want my name
anywhere near this shit."

333
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,360
Because compared to this,

334
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,520
waking up as
a cockroach is normal!

335
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,160
This whole process
makes no sense,

336
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,960
and I understand the need
for security screenings,

337
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,880
but America has done
this quicker before.

338
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,920
MAN: After the Vietnam War,
the U.S. resettled

339
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,920
140,000 refugees
in just 4 months.

340
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,200
We did it perfectly
at the end of the Vietnam War,

341
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,280
and there is
a sentence you don't often

342
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,800
get to say out loud.

343
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,840
What we did was we
took every one to Guam

344
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,880
and processed them
there in safety.

345
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,240
So why aren't we just
doing that again?

346
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,960
What else are we
gonna do with Guam?

347
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,240
It's Guam.

348
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,840
It's 200 square miles
of palm trees

349
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,480
and storage space.

350
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,760
It's Guam.

351
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,800
And while the U.S.
government may have

352
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,960
doubts about some
of these translators,

353
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,800
the troops who served
alongside them

354
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,520
certainly don't.

355
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,000
Because you
remember Srosh?

356
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,680
Well, the Marines he
served with created

357
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,080
a crowd-funding page
to finance his medical exams,

358
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,960
where you can read
comments such as

359
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,560
"Thanks, brother, for helping
us survive and return

360
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,960
to our families alive,"

361
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,520
and, "Thanks for saving our
ass so many times.

362
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,440
Time to get you state side."

363
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,360
And it is both inspiring
and horrifying that

364
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,080
the life of a man who saved
Americans is in the hands

365
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,840
of the same process
through which we finance

366
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,840
Zach Braff's
shitty movies.

367
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,960
And--and let me--

368
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,320
let me show you--
let me show you

369
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,040
just one more case.

370
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,840
Mohammad, an Afghani
translator who started

371
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,120
his application
in September 2010

372
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,440
and finally made it to America 3
years and 4 months later.

373
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,760
So at least he's here.

374
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,840
There is that,
but this was the atmosphere

375
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,840
in which he had to
do that waiting.

376
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,400
The people who tried
to hurt me, first they

377
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,520
killed my dad,
and at the next stage,

378
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,040
they tried to kill my brothers.

379
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,560
They took my little brother,
which I love him

380
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,800
more than everyone.

381
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,440
Once, they took him,
and they told me to pay

382
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,160
almost $35,000.

383
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,280
That's right.

384
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,960
They kidnapped
his 3-year-old brother,

385
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,920
and he spent his entire
life savings to get him back,

386
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,360
and at that point,
it was already 2 1/2 years

387
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,040
into his application process,
and having gone

388
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,400
through all that,
when Mohammad finally got

389
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,400
his visa, a clerical error
resulted in his name

390
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,040
being officially changed
to FNU Mohammad, which is

391
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,080
an acronym for
First Name Unknown,

392
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,560
meaning that on official
documents, to all intents

393
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,000
and purposes,
his name is now Fnu.

394
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,480
And Fnu is fnot a fnucking fname.

395
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,040
And--and I know we can
do this quicker, not just

396
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,840
because of Guam,
because there is at least one

397
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,680
other documented case of
an evacuee from Iraq who

398
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,960
did get processed faster.

399
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,920
Smoke, the Iraqi donkey,
is in the U.S.

400
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,000
Smoke the donkey wandered
onto a military base

401
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,080
in 2008 and was befriended
by some U.S. Marines.

402
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,120
WOMAN: They have
brought the donkey

403
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,400
to the United States.

404
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,000
Smoke is now an American.

405
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,520
MAN: It was a long process.

406
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,920
I wanted to say we
started this probably

407
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,880
back in September of 2010.

408
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,720
Remember who else
started his application

409
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,560
in September of 2010?

410
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,800
Mohammad.

411
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,920
It took Smoke the donkey
8 months to get to America.

412
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,720
It took Mohammad
nearly 3 1/2 years.

413
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,160
See? I told you this
story was gonna end

414
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,240
with you getting fucking
pissed off at a donkey.

415
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,880
Fuck you, Smoke!

416
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,680
You hee-hawing
piece of shit!

417
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,800
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

418
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,960
I'm sorry. It's not
your fault, Smoke.

419
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,840
You're just emblematic
of a much larger problem,

420
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,160
you hee-hawing
piece of shit.

421
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,640
Now listen.

422
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,080
We have to fix this system,
but before we can

423
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,000
even do that,
we have to extend it.

424
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,840
In Iraq, the visa program
expired at the end

425
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,680
of last month,
which I guess is fine.

426
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,480
It's not like we're gonna
need translators again

427
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,240
there anytime soon,
and in Afghanistan,

428
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,360
they're scheduled to stop
issuing visas altogether

429
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,280
on December 31, meaning
that any translator like

430
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,680
Mohammad will be forced
to find a friend

431
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,240
and invest in a very
good two-pieced pantomime

432
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,800
donkey costume to
have any fucking hope

433
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,720
of getting into
this country.

434
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,840
I'm honored to say that
we are actually joined

435
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,000
by Mohammad this evening.

436
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,960
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Mohammad!

437
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,920
Sit down, buddy.
Sit down.

438
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,560
Mohammad.
Yes.

439
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,920
First--first, thank you
so much for being here

440
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,440
and for everything
you've done, Mohammad.

441
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,440
Uh, Fnu. Sorry. Fnu. It's Fnu.

442
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,800
Ha ha ha!

443
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,120
Which do you prefer--
Mohammad or Fnu?

444
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,520
Which is better?

445
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,360
Well, now it's
Fnu, so I have--

446
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,600
It's Fnu,
it's Fnu, it's Fnu.

447
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,000
Well, Fnu, I have
a few questions for you.

448
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,920
Now we've just seen how crazy
the visa process is.

449
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,800
As a translator,
I'm interested,

450
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,440
what is the Pashto word

451
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,800
for bureaucratic
clusterfuck?

452
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,080
What is it?

453
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,400
OK. Nice. That's good.

454
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,560
So at least we've all
learned a bit of useful

455
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,880
Pashto this evening
if nothing else.

456
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,720
Look. I want to--
a couple of things

457
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,680
just about your
situation because while

458
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,840
working with
the U.S. military,

459
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,920
you were shot
at twice and survived

460
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,480
an IED explosion.

461
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,120
So I really guess
I first want to ask

462
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,200
why did you choose
to do that job?

463
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,840
I was working
with British forces,

464
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,920
and during that
time, I met

465
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,160
with one American
contractor.

466
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,560
He recruited me,
and he came to me like,

467
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,640
"Come work with us as
a translator.

468
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,600
We need people to
help us,"

469
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,720
and I was not
by my own.

470
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,320
I was like, "OK. I must talk to my family."

471
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,640
So I went and talked
to my family,

472
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,840
I talked to my dad.

473
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,880
He was glad.

474
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,040
He was really excited.

475
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,600
He was like, "This is
a great opportunity.

476
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,720
"You're gonna be helping
your country,

477
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,960
"and you're supporting
the U.S. troops,

478
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,280
"that they're here
for your country,

479
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,200
to rebuild
your country."

480
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,920
So the next day, I signed
the contract and stand up

481
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,200
for being a translator
to support the U.S. troops

482
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,320
or the coalition forces
and help my country.

483
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,680
Let's talk a little
about your family now

484
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,200
because your mom
and your siblings,

485
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,840
they have left Afghanistan,
is that correct?

486
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,160
Yes.
Why did they leave?

487
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,520
Because once the Taliban,

488
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,560
they kidnapped
my little brother.

489
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,800
One time, they killed my dad,
and the second time

490
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,040
when they kidnapped
my little brother,

491
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,160
so it was too much.

492
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,120
We didn't want to take
the third-time risk.

493
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,880
I have to pay them.

494
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,720
They left me a note,
a ransom letter that says

495
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,760
I have to pay $35,000.

496
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,240
I paid them their money,
and they released

497
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,000
my da--my brother.

498
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,920
I wish that could have
happened to my dad, too,

499
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,240
I could have bought him, too, but that
didn't happen.

500
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,480
So now they're hiding.

501
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,360
And they're hiding,
and they're involved

502
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,960
in this hail Mary humanitarian
visa application.

503
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,880
Now where this
bureaucracy gets even

504
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,480
crazier is if you had been
an Iraqi interpreter

505
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,960
your family would have
been eligible to come

506
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,640
here under category 5 of the Direct Access
Program,

507
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,960
but Afghanistan
does not have a similar

508
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,720
program for no fucking
reason whatsoever.

509
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,800
My family got--they
got hurt because of me.

510
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,320
I lost my dad because
of me, because of my job,

511
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,800
so the process that they have for us is just
a single man.

512
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,840
I worked for them.

513
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,640
"Here. This is
the visa, just you.

514
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,160
Come to the United States,"
and...

515
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,080
Um, I guess I have
one final question.

516
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,720
Is there a word
in Pashto to convey

517
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,920
deep gratitude
for someone's service

518
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,960
but also profound shame

519
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,000
in how they've
been treated?

520
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,320
Not really.

521
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,840
Heh. There isn't really
in English either.

522
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,080
I can't thank you enough for being
here, Mohammad,

523
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,240
and everything.

524
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,520
Mohammad, ladies
and gentlemen.

525
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,840
Thank you.
Thanks so much.

526
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
I really, really
appreciate it.

527
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,360
Thank you.

528
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,200
And now this.

529
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,240
I've been in Congress
for 43 years.

530
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,320
I've been in Congress
for 19 years.

531
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,920
33 years I've
been in Congress.

532
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,520
Hey. I've been in
Congress 3 months.

533
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,920
I've been in Congress...
I've been in Congress...

534
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,000
I've been in Congress...
25 years.

535
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,880
I've been in Congress
the last 17 months.

536
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,960
I've been
in Congress now...

537
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,160
...for 18 years.

538
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,800
Here we are. I've been
here for 5 years.

539
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,280
4 1/2.
24 years.

540
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,600
24 years that
I've been here.

541
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,240
I've been in...
Congress for 21 years.

542
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,360
3 years that I know
of that I've been in Congress.

543
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,400
19...
15...

544
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,400
15...
14 years.

545
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,400
4 or 5 months now.

546
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,320
13 years
and about 8 days.

547
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,400
16 months.

548
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,640
MAN: How many years
have you been

549
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,600
in the Congress?
Thanks.

550
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,720
This is my 15th year.

551
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,600
Thank you.

552
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,880
And finally tonight, the Supreme Court,

553
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,320
their latest term began
earlier this month,

554
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,720
and it's going to be
one to watch.

555
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,880
Unfortunately, we won't
actually be able to watch

556
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,040
any of it because
the Supreme Court does not

557
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,120
allow cameras during
oral arguments,

558
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,680
and I'll let
Justice Scalia explain why.

559
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,200
If I really thought
it would educate

560
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,880
the American people,
I would be all for it,

561
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,960
but what most of the American
people would see would be

562
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,000
30-second, 15-second
takeouts from our argument,

563
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,480
and those takeouts would not be
characteristic of what we do.

564
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,000
You know, he might
be right about that.

565
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,920
Television can be very
irresponsible, which is

566
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,560
why you never want
to, for instance, do

567
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,640
an interview in front
of a blue screen

568
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,960
because someone might
then superimpose

569
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,240
a creepy orgy behind you
because that's the sort

570
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,000
of terrible thing
that television can do.

571
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,040
So the point is--
the point is there aren't

572
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,080
any cameras,
but they do release

573
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,120
audio recordings
of their arguments,

574
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,680
so TV does play 15-second clips
of the Supreme Court anyway.

575
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,040
It's just that they have to present it like this.

576
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,120
JUSTICE KAGAN:
Suppose a state said...

577
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,320
OK. For a start,
that is a terrible rendering

578
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,880
of Justice Kagan.

579
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,840
You just made her look
like Jonah Hill in a wig,

580
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,080
and also--also,
it was boring,

581
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,560
and that's a problem
because what happens

582
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,280
at the Supreme Court is way
too important not to pay

583
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,000
attention to,
and yet the ban renders

584
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,960
any coverage
basically unwatchable,

585
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,000
but I think we may have
a solution,

586
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:48,240
and it's learning
a lesson from this.

587
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,520
Think about it.

588
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,720
If someone made you
just listen to the audio

589
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,800
of that, you would punch them
repeatedly in the face,

590
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,520
but the visual
makes it irresistible.

591
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,720
Why? Because a cat's paws
are doing things you

592
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,800
wouldn't expect them to do,
and if it works

593
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,960
for shitty piano music,
it can work

594
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,480
for the Supreme Court,
and that is why this week

595
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,880
we spent an incredible
amount of time

596
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,720
and an almost immoral amount
of resources to produce

597
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,800
an entire Supreme Court

598
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,440
featuring real animals
with fake paws.

599
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,040
Settle down,
settle down, settle down.

600
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,720
Let me show you this
puppy in action.

601
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,720
One of the current
cases in the court

602
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,360
is Holt v. Hobbs.

603
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,880
It's about whether
a prison can require

604
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,400
a Muslim inmate to
trim his beard

605
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,880
for security reasons.

606
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,080
Now you may be thinking,
"John, I do not want to

607
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,920
hear a discussion
about that."

608
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,480
Really?

609
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,880
Don't you?

610
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,960
Now let's assume I'm
in a religion that

611
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,520
requires polygamy.

612
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,200
Um, could I say
to the prison,

613
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,120
"Well, OK. I won't
have 3 wives.

614
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,120
Just let me
have 2 wives."

615
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,960
I mean, you're still
violating your religion

616
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,680
it seems to me if he
allows his beard to be

617
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,480
clipped to one inch, isn't it?

618
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,480
Well, it is the state's
burden that is explicit

619
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,000
in the statute.

620
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,040
The only limit they
impose on the hair

621
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,920
on top of your head is
it can't extend

622
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,320
below the middle
of the neck.

623
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,640
The difference between
the hair on top of your

624
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,800
head and the hair
on the front of your head

625
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,360
is not even rational.

626
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,640
Be honest. You now want
to hear the entire

627
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,720
hour-long oral
argument, don't you?

628
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,400
No, no.

629
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,720
But I will give you
just another taste.

630
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,840
As far as searching
the beard is concerned,

631
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,920
why can't the prison just
give the inmate a comb?

632
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,920
You could develop
whatever kind of comb

633
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,160
you want and say,
"Comb your beard."

634
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,200
And if there's anything in
there, if there's a SIM card

635
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,560
in there or a revolver
or anything else

636
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,480
you think...

637
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,760
can be hidden in
a half-inch beard,

638
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,840
a tiny revolver,
it will fall out.

639
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,280
Those dry constitutional
arguments are now

640
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,840
must-see television,
and that is why tonight

641
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,000
as a public service
we are releasing raw video

642
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,960
at this address
of closeups, medium shots,

643
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,760
and wide shots from our
real animals/fake paws

644
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,080
Supreme Court,
and we are inviting

645
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,480
all news networks to use
this footage to make

646
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,280
Supreme Court arguments
more compelling to watch.

647
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,720
We have all 9 justices
for you:

648
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,080
Chief Justice Roberts,
there's Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas,

649
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:27,640
Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito,
Sotomayor, and Kagan,

650
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,160
who, I will warn you,
would not sit still.

651
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,760
And--and we have almost
everything you need

652
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,880
for full coverage.

653
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,880
You need Justice Alito
taking notes?

654
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,240
Done. Not a problem.

655
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,480
You need Ginsburg
adjusting her glasses?

656
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,840
You got it.

657
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,880
You need Samuel Alito
having a drink of water?

658
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,400
No problem.

659
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,680
You need Roberts yawning?

660
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,080
He'll yawn for you!

661
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,120
You need Alito covering
his ears with his paws

662
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,680
or banging a gavel

663
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,000
or humping Elena Kagan?

664
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,200
We have all of
those things.

665
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,040
Why? Because the Alito dog was fucking amazing!

666
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,600
Plus we have two lawyers
for you to choose from,

667
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,480
also a duck assistant,
and a court stenographer

668
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,680
who's just doing
the best she can to keep up.

669
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,320
The entire toolkit is
here for anyone to do

670
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,000
with as they please,
and if there are not full

671
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,640
reenactments of every
major court case

672
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,960
of the past 4 years
online by next Sunday,

673
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,800
you will never
see us here again.

674
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,960
That's our show.
Thank you so much for watching.

675
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:32,200
Good night!
