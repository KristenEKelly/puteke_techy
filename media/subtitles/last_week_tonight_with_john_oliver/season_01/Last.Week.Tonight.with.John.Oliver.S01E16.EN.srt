00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,800
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,360
Episode 16

3
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,800
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,560
So exciting to be back with you.
Just time for a quick recap

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,040
of what we've missed
since we were on break.

6
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,880
In a word: ISIS.
In three words: Holy fuck, ISIS.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,560
They are the terrorist group
that is scaring the entire planet.

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,680
Everyone is worried about
how to respond to them,

9
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,240
including, we learned this week,
their fellow terrorists.

10
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,080
It's all been about ISIS
in Iraq and Syria.

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,640
Al Qaeda know
they're yesterday's story.

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,720
ISIS is the flavor
of the month now.

13
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,640
Even Ayman al-Zawihiri, who is
now in his mid-60s,

14
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,440
is feeling that: no one
is really paying attention to me.

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,680
Nobody's pays attention to me,
I do bad things too,

16
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,000
why don't you care ?

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,440
It's not fair.

18
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,320
The head of Al Qaeda
is feeling neglected.

19
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,840
He's tried everything, from posting
sad, cryptic Facebook status updates

20
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,840
to even doing
the Ice bucket challenge.

21
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,760
Now I challenge you,
Adam Levine and Ellen Page !

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,120
Al Zawahri attempted to regain
the terror momentum from ISIS,

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,440
by releasing a new video announcing
that Al Qaeda's expanded into India.

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,240
My Muslim brothers everywhere,
I announce to all Muslims in the world

25
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,840
and especially in India,
the founding of a new branch.

26
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay, first:
don't call it a new branch.

27
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,840
You are a terrorist organization,
not a Capital One.

28
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,000
This proves Al Qaeda
is running out of ideas.

29
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,840
Going to India to remain
relevant is such a tired concept.

30
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,880
It worked for The Beatles.
And Danny Boyle.

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,560
To some extent Wes Anderson.
Al Qaeda is supposed to be better.

32
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,000
But you can see why
al Zawahri's threatened:

33
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,040
even when media's supposed to be
talking about his videotape,

34
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,480
they discuss about how much more
entertaining ISIS's videos are.

35
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,360
One of the interesting things
about the videotape was

36
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,040
how boring it is, you know.

37
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,720
When you think about the ISIS
social media campaign,

38
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,600
it's highly effective,
it's well edited, it's exciting.

39
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,800
You've got a picture of al-Zawahri
blabbing away for a half hour.

40
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,720
Blabbing away ?
Am I right ?

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,680
This guy truly is a mass murderer.
He is boring me to death.

42
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,280
Everyone noticed ISIS's viral success.
Even the U.S. government.

43
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,160
They recently decided that
it would be a good idea

44
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,800
to try to beat ISIS
at their own game.

45
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,880
The State Department has produced
a counter-narrative.

46
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,320
A new video. We can show you a clip
of that right there as well,

47
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,880
that it sarcastically kind
of tells potential ISIS recruits

48
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,880
that they can quote learn useful
skills by blowing up mosques,

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,040
by crucifying and executing
Muslims, as you see there.

50
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,120
What the fuck are you doing ?!
The state department has created

51
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,680
a sarcastic parody recruitment
video for ISIS

52
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,920
that begins with the words run,
do not walk, to ISIS land.

53
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,120
And you are banking a lot
on any potential militants

54
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,320
understand that that is sarcasm.

55
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,960
I was about to join ISIS,
but I saw your very clever video,

56
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,160
telling me to join ISIS, but using
ironic juxtaposition of words

57
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,280
to suggest
I should do the opposite.

58
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,520
Just like Chandler in "Friends",
could we be any more militant ?

59
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,800
I totally get it.

60
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,520
Ironic propaganda is a dangerous
game for a government. Believe me.

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,640
This did not work for England

62
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,480
when we tried to pull that shit
on Germany back in 1936.

63
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,720
Germany ! That Hitler chap,
seems like he's got swell ideas !

64
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,360
Here's a thought: why
don't you all become Nazis ?

65
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,520
While you're at it,
Poland's nice this time of year !

66
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,160
Why don't you just pop over there
and take it ?

67
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,680
That would be a realy good idea !
Run don't walk to the Nazi land.

68
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,720
Are we 100 percent sure they're
going to get the sarcasm here ?

69
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,600
And finally this week: Libya.

70
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,480
It has been three years
since Gaddafi fell.

71
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,120
How are things going there ?

72
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,800
That really all depends
on your opinion of pool parties.

73
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,480
I've never been a fan
of waddling around

74
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,320
with a stomachache
in a tepid pool of human filth.

75
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,480
But it seems that Libyan rebels
would beg to differ.

76
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:31,000
In a country free-falling into
chaos, Libyan gunmen celebrate.

77
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,400
They've taken an American
diplomatic compound,

78
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,520
so they take to the swimming pool.

79
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,320
A symbolic moment
they want the world to see.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,360
Libya seems to be descending into
chaos at the hands of Islamist militias

81
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,000
but on the other hand...

82
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,400
That does look like one
bomb-ass pool party.

83
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,880
Bust out the pizza rolls
and the two liters of Mountain Dew

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,320
because Tripoli has fallen and
it's time to play some Marco Polo.

85
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,080
Marco, we're having fun.
It's supposed to be fun.

86
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,200
This situation is not ideal.
Although we may have stumbled

87
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,160
on a useful shorthand for all
potential foreign policy fiascos.

88
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,160
We better be careful
how we leave Afghanistan,

89
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,440
or it could turn into a total
Libyan pool party over there.

90
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,560
Don't get me started
on Ukraine.

91
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,160
That's a Libyan pool party
waiting to happen.

92
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,280
How about we take
that sarcastic ISIS video down ?

93
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,600
That has the potential to end

94
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,200
in the biggest Libyan pool party
the world has ever seen.

95
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,120
And now this:

96
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,360
"60 Minutes" anchors prompting
people to deliver

97
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,400
the exact soundbite they need.

98
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,560
- You got to hand it to him.
- Yes.

99
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,240
He was off and running.

100
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,720
- One way of dealing with the anxiety.
- Is to laugh at it.

101
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,000
So it drives the price up.

102
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,440
You did everything together.

103
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,920
With that cartoon.

104
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,880
He is sort of
the father of hot sauce.

105
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,200
- Does that surprise you ?
- It does.

106
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,880
- You're saying we shouldn't ?
- We shouldn't.

107
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,240
There's no reason to prepare.

108
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,040
And that's essentially
a commercial for GoPro.

109
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,840
- All of them banned ?
- All of them banned.

110
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,920
With the crowd there ?
That's quite an image.

111
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,000
- It was almost a cakewalk actually.
- A cakewalk ?

112
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,960
To beat the system.

113
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,200
To cheat.

114
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,760
Moving on
to our main story tonight.

115
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,560
Hundreds of thousands of students

116
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,600
started classes
at colleges and universities.

117
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,440
By the time they graduate,
most students are going to be leaving

118
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,600
with a lot more than just
a tacky polyester robe

119
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,000
and a copy of "Oh The Places You'll Go"
that their tearful aunt got them.

120
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,680
They'll be leaving with this:

121
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,160
Seven of ten graduating students
left college last year in debt.

122
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,920
The total bill due for students
in America tops one trillion dollars.

123
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,560
Student debt in the US is now bigger
than debt from credit cards

124
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,280
and auto loans
and is second only to mortgages.

125
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,800
Essentially student debt is like HPV:
if you go to college,

126
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,440
you're almost certainly going
to get it, and if you do,

127
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,000
it will follow you
for the rest of your life.

128
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,960
Legally student debt
is a special kind of debt.

129
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,600
It is the most collectible
kind of debt there is.

130
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,040
It is non dischargeable
in bankruptcy.

131
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,560
They will garnish your wages.
They will intercept your tax refunds.

132
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,000
They will sue you.

133
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,280
They'll steal your wallet.
They will pawn your baby shoes.

134
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,560
They will shrink themselves,
hide in your pocket

135
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,040
and take that money back
one dime at a time.

136
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,040
Student debt has tripled
in the past decade.

137
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,080
It has surpassed Bob Marley's
greatest hits album

138
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,280
as the thing seemingly
every college student has.

139
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,360
How did this happen ? More
than 90 percent of student debt

140
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,720
is subsidized
by the federal government.

141
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,280
It all started
with such good intentions.

142
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,120
One of the Federal Student
Loan's programs' early champions:

143
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,960
Poverty must not be
a bar to learning

144
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,440
and learning must offer
an escape from poverty.

145
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,760
Escape From Poverty,
by the way,

146
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,800
the "worst" Kurt Russell
movie ever made.

147
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,840
A higher education system open to all
was one of LBJ's top priorities,

148
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,520
along with creating of course
a Libyan pool party in Vietnam

149
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,160
and finding a pair of pants that
could contain his gigantic testicles.

150
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,840
That might sound like a joke,
but listen to this conversation

151
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,120
he had in the Oval Office

152
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,400
with a representative
from the Haggar Clothing Company.

153
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,080
The crotch, where the nuts hang,
is always a little too tight.

154
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,000
So when you make 'em up
give me an inch I can let out there,

155
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,080
because they cut me,
it's like riding a wire fence.

156
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:27,040
Let's see if you can't leave me
an inch from where the zipper ends

157
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,560
round under back
to my bunghole.

158
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,520
That's real.

159
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,720
We all thought the "b" in LBJ
stood for Baines,

160
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,640
but it actually stands for
"balls balls, my big bulbous balls"

161
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,480
"are too close to my bunghole."

162
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,160
Isn't history fun ?
But like LBJ's testicles,

163
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,520
the federal student loan program has
swollen to uncomfortable proportions.

164
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,360
One reason for this might be
that in recent years

165
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,520
states have slashed funding
for higher education by 23 percent,

166
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,240
public institutions responded
by raising tuition rates,

167
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,040
forcing students to take out
ever larger loans.

168
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,080
Why do you think colleges
have so many a cappella groups ?

169
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,720
They know they sound stupid,
they just can't afford instruments.

170
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,640
Another consequence of these cuts
has been that community colleges

171
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,800
have been forced to reduce capacity,

172
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,160
leading to things like
a nursing program in North Carolina

173
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,240
with a waiting list
just to get on the waiting list.

174
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,480
That is what you need in
the land of tobacco and barbeque,

175
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,280
a shortage of nurses.

176
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,720
But all this shows: that people
in this country,

177
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,880
they want to go to school
to better their lives.

178
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,200
It is good they have broad access
to federal funds to help them do that.

179
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,760
The problem is,
this is where we meet

180
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,280
one of the biggest drivers
of student debt:

181
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,600
for-profit schools, like University
of Phoenix and ITT Tech.

182
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,400
Most of them are publicly
traded on Wall Street

183
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,360
and run
commercials like these !

184
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,320
I was watching TV and
an ITT Tech commercial came on.

185
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,760
I decided to give them a call.
My education's paid off.

186
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,560
I got into the field of aerospace,
it's been over 12 years now.

187
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,880
There's nothing I would change
about my life.

188
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,880
We've been married over 10 years,
have two boys, everything is perfect.

189
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,080
That's nice.

190
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,680
There's something about
the phrase "everything" is perfect

191
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,560
that I find suspicious.

192
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,440
Because the only other person
who says that is Janice in accounting

193
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,120
and she secretly puts Jim Beam
in her coffee cup

194
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,160
and repeats "keep it together,
you can do this Janice"

195
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,600
into the bathroom mirror
five times a day.

196
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,600
For-profit schools account for
nearly a third of all student loans,

197
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,400
despite having just 13 percent
of our country's students.

198
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,600
That is way out of proportion.

199
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,760
Part of why for-profit schools account
for so much student debt

200
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,760
is that they are not cheap.

201
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,960
I was surprised to learn how
expensive tuition at for-profits is,

202
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,360
five to sixe times the cost
of a community college

203
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,600
and as much as twice a four-year
state university.

204
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,640
Five to six times the cost
of a community college.

205
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,800
Plus, you don't even get to hang out
with a study group of lovable scamps

206
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:34,840
for let's say
six seasons and a movie.

207
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,720
If you wonder
why they charge so much,

208
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,600
it's nothing to do
with the quality of education.

209
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,560
If you look at for-profit colleges,
the analysts will tell you

210
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,360
that between 20 and 25 percent
of the total revenue of a company

211
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,400
is in sales and marketing,
about a quarter.

212
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,000
In most cases, the faculty are
in the 10 to 20 percent range.

213
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,160
They spend half the amount on teachers
that they do on marketing.

214
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,400
He's basically saying: "Teachers,
we're not saying you don't matter,"

215
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,960
"we're saying ads about you
matter twice as much."

216
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,440
One for you... Two for
a spot during Wayne Brady.

217
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:21,600
From a purely business perspective,
that disparity makes some sense.

218
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,640
When I go and buy
perfume for my mom,

219
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:35,600
the chemicals in the bottle and
the bottle amount to about $0.50.

220
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,480
The advertising amounts
to five or six bucks.

221
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,680
Stop buying perfume for
your mom, you fucking creep.

222
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,440
I like the way you smell, mom.

223
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,520
You smell good.

224
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,320
And secondly:
perfume is not education.

225
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,160
Although I will say both
do market themselves aggressively.

226
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,960
With perfume, it's spraying it
into people's eyes in a store.

227
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,200
And for-profit schools,
it's even worse...

228
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,920
Zarah Crowley was a recruiter
at the for-profit Westwood in 2007.

229
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,480
Crowley quit because she couldn't
continue preying on low-income youth

230
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,360
and using something
called pain points.

231
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,920
A pain point would be something,
they work at McDonald's.

232
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,240
They don't want to be
like their parents. We turn it on them:

233
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,120
Do you want to work at McDonald's
for the rest of your life ?

234
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,320
They are told to
"hit people's pain points".

235
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,480
The only professionals
who should be doing that

236
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,000
are dominatrixes
or emo bands, that's it.

237
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,360
And this "pain point" approach
seems to be an industry-wide technique.

238
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,120
This is an actual slide some ITT tech
recruiters were shown,

239
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,920
that photo is from "Marathon Man",

240
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,680
where Lawrence Olivier
played a Nazi Torturer.

241
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,840
It's maybe not saying much
for your business model

242
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,600
if your essential logic is:
"This worked well for the Nazis,"

243
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,400
"let's at least give it a go !"

244
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,320
If you sign up for one these schools,
what education are you going to get ?

245
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,520
Remember this ITT Tech
Graduate from earlier ?

246
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,040
And his absolutely
perfect fucking life ?

247
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,800
It says on screen that he graduated
with an associate's degree

248
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,640
in engineering
from the ITT Sylmar campus.

249
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,320
We checked their public filings
and out of 115 students

250
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,720
who enrolled in that program
in the class of 2012,

251
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:48,520
three quarters didn't graduate
and 13 found work in that field.

252
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,920
Everyone else would've been
better off studying at Hogwarts.

253
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,880
At least that way, they'd have
an owl to show for it.

254
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,600
Even for those who do graduate,
job-hunting might be difficult.

255
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,440
As students from a Corinthian
College nursing program have found.

256
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,000
I have been
on countless interviews.

257
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,320
They all ask
if I've ever been in a hospital.

258
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,520
I have to tell them we never
set foot in a hospital. Ever.

259
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,960
We went to a Museum of Scientology
for our psychiatric rotation.

260
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,600
What ?! Scientologists
do not believe in psychiatry.

261
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,320
Their museum is called
"Psychiatry: An Industry of Death".

262
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:43,160
Going to the Museum of Scientology
for psychiatric rotation is insane.

263
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,040
Or evidence of a buildup
of thetans in your system.

264
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,080
You teach the controversy.
We asked Corinthian about this

265
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,000
and they requested that
we point out a few things:

266
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,160
such as the fact that those
women later sued the school.

267
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,320
A financial settlement was reached.

268
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,480
Those women later went
on to become registered nurses.

269
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,440
And also that us not mentioning
those facts to you would constitute

270
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,920
"reckless disregard for the truth."

271
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,800
Not the kind of reckless disregard
for the truth that would lead you

272
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,880
to send medical students
to a scientology museum.

273
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,800
Pretty reckless none the less.

274
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:28,280
They also wanted us to take

275
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,800
"clear and extensive note
of subsequent events."

276
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,520
In doing that,
know that this summer,

277
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,320
after a government investigation
of their job-placement numbers,

278
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,760
Corinthian Colleges have agreed to sell
or close every school they operate in.

279
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,160
I presume that's what they wanted
us to tell you, so job done.

280
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,560
To be fair here, we're good...

281
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,880
The federal government does try
to regulate these schools.

282
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,000
They are allowed a mere 90% of their
funding to come from federal loans.

283
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,360
For-profit schools found themselves
a horrifying loophole.

284
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,200
The 90/10 rule says schools
can only have 90% of their money

285
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,840
coming from loans, the other
10% could come from veteran loans.

286
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,360
These schools have gone
after the veterans benefits

287
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,760
as a way to leverage their
ability to sign up more students.

288
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah, they're going after veterans.

289
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,920
The only time "going after veterans"
is okay

290
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,280
is when you let them walk
through the door in front of you.

291
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,520
Not when you try
to take their money.

292
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,800
For-profit schools took in
$1.7 billion in GI Bill money

293
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,040
in the last reported school year.

294
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,800
And this is the length to which
Ashford University was willing to go

295
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,400
to get that sweet
budget-assisting veteran dollar:

296
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,120
I went to a marine base
in North Carolina

297
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,800
and I found that one
of the for-profit colleges

298
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,120
was sending a recruiter to
the wounded warriors barracks,

299
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,880
where she was signing up
brain-injured marines

300
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,920
who had difficulty remembering
what courses they were taking.

301
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:13,280
Holy shit. I will say this
for for-profit schools:

302
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,360
they've just give us all
a first-class education

303
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,840
in the depths of human depravity,
we all have a diploma in that now.

304
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,000
Here is where I have some
good news and some bad news.

305
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,560
A few years back, the Obama
administration proposed

306
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,080
tighter
"gainful employment" standards.

307
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,280
The bad news is,
everything that happened after that.

308
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,240
For-profit industry spent $10 million
in lobbying that year.

309
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,480
And also, their trade group
inundated the government

310
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,600
with letters from
"ordinary" students and educators

311
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,160
asking them not to tighten
the regulations.

312
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,520
Let me read on to you:

313
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,840
I am a career college student
at institution studying program.

314
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,000
Institution is providing me
with the education and training

315
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,680
necessary to obtain the job
I've always wanted as a career.

316
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,360
Many people didn't even
bother filling in the blanks !

317
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,000
Couldn't they at least do it
like mad libs ?

318
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,120
You could have gone
Butt-Cheese University

319
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,840
seeking a degree in Weiner studies,
go the extra mile !

320
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,040
And the worst thing is,
the campaign worked !

321
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,920
The gainful employment rules
were weakened and struck down.

322
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,320
The latest version of the rules
are expected by November

323
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,080
and the for-profit trade group, APSCU,
is still lobbying hard against them.

324
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,960
If you'd like to um let APSCU know
how you feel about their behavior

325
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,560
we've prepared a form letter
for you which reads:

326
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,280
To whom it may concern:
I am name here,

327
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,280
a human being with describe
at least some level of sense

328
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,080
who is sick of your
synonym for "bullshit".

329
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,200
Whatever the benefits
of for-profit schools,

330
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,280
your trade group is protecting
some of the worst actors

331
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,840
and additional insults.

332
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,840
Ideas for places to cram
this letter once rolled up.

333
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,760
Proposals for human waste
products to be eaten.

334
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,120
Thank you for your time.
Name here again.

335
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,560
Feel free to go online,
copy this letter,

336
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:29,560
do not bother to fill it in at all
and send it to APSCU at this address.

337
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,040
That might make you feel
a little bit better.

338
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,840
But it will only be temporary.
The student-debt problem

339
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,880
is far bigger
than just for-profit schools.

340
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,240
If they all went away,
the student debt would still be here.

341
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,280
Our leaders have decided that
while education is important,

342
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,120
it's not important enough
to actually pay for.

343
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,080
So with that in mind,
let me speak right now

344
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,920
to all current freshman in college
who have student loans.

345
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,160
Stop watching this show right now.
You don't have time.

346
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,840
Get out there and enjoy your college
experience because you may be paying

347
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,040
for the rest of your life.

348
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,800
Drink beer from a funnel !
Kidnap a mascot !

349
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,800
Find out if you're gay or not.
Even if you are not,

350
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,720
have some gay experiences,
do it now, it doesn't count !

351
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,400
Become that weird guy on campus
who rides a unicycle.

352
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,840
Find out whoever the Winklevoss
twins of your school are

353
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,880
and steal their idea for a website.

354
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,160
Shoot fireworks out of every
bodily orifice you can find.

355
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,880
Do it now ! Make sure your college
years are the best ones of your life !

356
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,080
Thanks to the debt that
we are saddling you with,

357
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,360
they almost certainly will be !

358
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,920
Get out there and do it !
Go nuts ! Go crazy !

359
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,520
And now this:

360
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,640
Even more '60 Minutes'
anchors prompting people

361
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,240
to deliver
the exact soundbite they need.

362
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,720
Seriously,
they do this all the time.

363
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,240
You don't hear the call.

364
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,720
You don't see the name.

365
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,640
- And that was you.
- That was me.

366
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,680
- You were chased.
- I was chased.

367
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,800
It didn't turn out that way.

368
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,000
- Only in America.
- Right.

369
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,800
There was a backup plan.

370
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,200
- Is that essentially it ?
- That's it.

371
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,280
Old heart, new heart.

372
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,640
Ended up
with the national championship.

373
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,640
It was a proposal.

374
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,040
To destroy computers.

375
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,160
- It's like you can't let go.
- You can't let go ?

376
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,440
You can't let go.

377
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,320
Respect.

378
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,400
Finally tonight. Before we go,
you might remember

379
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,640
that a little over a month ago,
I brought to your attention

380
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,040
the single most urgent crisis
of our time.

381
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,040
Russia lost contact with a satellite
full of possibly mating geckos.

382
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,960
They were trying to observe their
mating activities in zero gravity.

383
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,320
Their pod stopped responding
to mission control.

384
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,080
It was terrifying.
Now, you may remember:

385
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,240
that in response to that, we launched
"#go get those geckos" campaign,

386
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,880
uniting all fans of astro-reptilian
fornication from all across the globe.

387
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,320
Soon after we launched
our campaign, we were victorious.

388
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,720
We even released a web video
announcing the good news.

389
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,320
Russia has regained communication
with their interstellar orgy-mobile !

390
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,360
Ladies and gentlemen, we did it !
The geckos got got !

391
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:49,240
I remember those days.
Such pure distilled joy.

392
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:56,840
I may have been a little premature.
The satellite landed this week

393
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,800
and Russia had a tragic
announcement to make.

394
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,640
Officials say five geckos that
were sent to space have died.

395
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,200
No ! I would ask for a moment
of silence, but that's not enough.

396
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,040
In honor of the five brave geckos
who lost their lives,

397
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,640
join me in five mournful
flicks of the tongue.

398
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:30,480
I want answers now:
how did this happen ?

399
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,920
They froze to death
because of equipment failure.

400
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,120
Fruit flies on that same mission
survived.

401
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,640
Who gives a shit ? I don't care
about the fruit flies !

402
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,280
I only care about
the frozen fuck lizards !

403
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,440
Up in that shuttle there were
four females and one male.

404
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,160
We sent those geckos to have sex
in space not because they were easy,

405
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,960
but because he was hard.

406
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,720
Thank you.

407
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,880
This is devastating.

408
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,800
And these brave, horny space
reptiles deserve a dignified send off.

409
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,920
Those geckos may not have been
able to speak English, being Russian.

410
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,920
They may not have been able to
speak Russian, being geckos.

411
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,640
I am sure they could understand
the universal language of music.

412
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,440
So with that in mind,
to help me honor their memory,

413
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,360
singing their hit song
"Say Something",

414
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,440
please welcome
"A Great Big World".

415
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,160
We're all going to miss
those horny little fuck lizards.

416
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,080
But let's remember they died
doing what they loved.

417
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,360
Fucking in space.

418
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,680
I know that right now,
they're up in heaven, right up there...

419
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,920
And they are having high-pitched sex
on the ceiling of God's bedroom.

420
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:23,240
And I swallow my pride.

421
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:31,560
You're the one that I love.
And I'm saying goodbye.

422
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,320
Say something,
I'm giving up on you.

423
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,840
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you.

424
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,280
And anywhere I would follow you.

425
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,120
Say something,
I'm giving up on you.

426
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,360
Thank you for watching.
My deep thanks to "A Great Big World".

427
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,560
Please, do join us next week.
Goodnight to you !

428
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,280
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

429
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,760
END OF EPISODE 16
