00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,960
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,520
Episode 4

3
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,760
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,640
My guest tonight: Fareed Zakaria
will be with us, very exciting.

5
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,040
Quick roundup of the world.

6
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,600
It was something of a week
of angry protests around the globe.

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,440
In Brazil, people took to the streets
over government corruption,

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,200
while in Turkey, thousands
protested the government

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,680
after a horrific mine accident

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,480
and the Turkish Prime Minister
responded in an unusual way.

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,920
Many are also angry because
of a video that has emerged

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,880
that appears to show
the Turkish Prime Minister

13
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,560
slapping someone as he was
mobbed by an angry crowd.

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,000
A Turkish newspaper today
is quoting the prime minister

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,520
as saying, if you boo the
Prime Minister, you get slapped.

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,160
Yeah, boo me, you get slapped.
Scowl at me, purple nurple.

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,440
You disagree with me:
it's a tickle attack.

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,960
In happier times here at home,

19
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,160
yesterday was something
of a wonderful anniversary.

20
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,840
Ten years ago today,
Massachusetts became

21
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,520
the first state
to legalize same sex marriage.

22
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:51,560
Yes, ten year, that's right.
Ten year anniversary of gay marriage !

23
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,880
And that sound you hear
is a lesbian in Northampton

24
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,320
figuring out why her partner
was in a mood all day yesterday.

25
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,360
Happy Saturday, I guess, Linda, see
as that seems to be all it is to you.

26
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,040
Ten years !

27
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,600
Since then, we've come even
further with gay marriage.

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,720
It's now legal in 17 states. For all
accomplishments in the political realm,

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,440
marriage equality still faces
unusual obstacles.

30
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,080
Nintendo is the target
of a social media campaign.

31
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,960
In the company's upcoming game,
called the 'Tomodachi Life',

32
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,800
you can make your avatar
do just about anything

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,800
but your avatar "cannot"
marry another avatar of the same sex.

34
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,280
You can use a civil union cheat
code, but it's just not the same.

35
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,600
It's up, up, down, down,
be gay, be gay, start.

36
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,680
Keep that to yourself !

37
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,160
But in a happy sign of progress,
Nintendo made a big announcement.

38
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,760
Nintendo is apologizing, pledging
to be more inclusive in the future.

39
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,960
While it says it's too late
to change the game now,

40
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,160
it is committed to building virtual
equality into later versions.

41
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,920
Yes ! Virtual eventual equality !
That's the dream.

42
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,120
Let's see how this news
went down in Nintendo's world.

43
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,240
Mario just got the call,
he is overjoyed about the news.

44
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,920
Here's his friend Link
and they are...

45
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,440
I didn't know
either of them were gay.

46
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,160
Link seems a little young
for Mario, here's a....

47
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,080
That's Princess Peach
and Princess Zelda.

48
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,560
Let's give them some privacy,
shall we ?

49
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,080
Wonderful, Yoshi and Toad,
wasting no time getting married !

50
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,040
The beauty is, they now got access
to instant benefits power-ups.

51
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,480
Pension in a box, that's great !
You love to see stability like that.

52
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,080
This is bittersweet. Bowser
received his death benefits

53
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,880
after the death of his partner
Donkey Kong.

54
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,600
That's good,
they had a lifetime together,

55
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,200
Donkey Kong would want him
taken care of.

56
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,640
Why are you so sad ? Donkey Kong
dies multiple times every day !

57
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,840
Would it make you happier
if I restarted the game ?

58
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,600
Let's do that,
restart the game right now.

59
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,000
There you go !
See, they're back,

60
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,000
they're alive and well
and enjoying brunch together.

61
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,280
Happy now ? They're brunching,
are you not entertained ?

62
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,040
And now, this:

63
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,920
The past week
in Bullshit National Holidays.

64
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,840
It may be Wednesday to you,
but it's National Biscuit Day to us.

65
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,840
- It is National Nylon Stockings Day.
- National Odometer Day.

66
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,800
- Third Shift Workers Day.
- Piercing Day !

67
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,880
- Hepatitis Testing Day.
- International Museum Day.

68
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,320
Pack Brat Day.

69
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,760
National Ride
Your Bike to Work Day !

70
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,840
- Wear Your Lifejacket to Work Day.
- Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Day.

71
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,360
- Dance Like a Chicken Day.
- It's National Limerick Day, so...

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,920
- There once was a girl named Sue.
- Never a good thing.

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,280
Apple Pie Day.

74
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,920
- It's National Hummus Day.
- National Pizza Party Day.

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,320
It's National
Chocolate Chip Cookie Day !

76
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,520
Let's move on.
Our main story this week

77
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,200
concerns a titan of American
industry: General Motors.

78
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,600
Few companies in history
have ever sold more cars.

79
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,920
As of this week, few company has
ever demanded as many of them back.

80
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,160
This is the year of the recall
for General Motors.

81
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,160
Today, GM recalled 2.7 million
more cars.

82
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,720
That brings the total to 11 million
recalled vehicles this year.

83
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,280
Eleven million cars !
We are approaching a "total recall".

84
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,280
Where you return your car to your
local three-breasted GM representative.

85
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,880
By and large,
these cars' flaws are frightening.

86
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,840
From steering loss
to power brake failure

87
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,280
to the fact that airbags, brakes
and power steering

88
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,040
could suddenly all switch off
at the same time.

89
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,920
If you're thinking: "I'm amazed
no one's been killed by that",

90
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,200
you would be wrong.

91
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,320
The government's own files show
as many as 303 accident related deaths,

92
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,400
the company admits 13 people
have been killed.

93
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,800
Here is a sign that your
corporation is in trouble:

94
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,360
when the statement "our product
only killed thirteen people"

95
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,600
is your "defense".

96
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,080
The government stepped in
and held GM to account.

97
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,960
General Motors is going have to pay
the government $35 million.

98
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,920
$35 million. That is a lot
of money for a car company. In 1923.

99
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,080
But for today's GM, it amounts
to less than one day of revenue.

100
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,760
There's only one GM employee
who is up in arms over this,

101
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,120
and it's "this guy".

102
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,160
And he's up in arms over
basically everything.

103
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,000
President's day...
Whenever it's windy.

104
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:26,320
This is a paltry amount of money.
It's about to seem even paltrier

105
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,080
when you learn how long GM waited
to tell customers about the problems.

106
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,160
The carmaker now says it found
the problem with an ignition switch

107
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,120
back in 2001 during
preproduction of the Saturn Ion.

108
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,080
So you knew of a potentially fatal
ignition problem for 13 years !

109
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,280
A child attending her first day
of school the day you found out

110
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,200
would be old enough to die
driving one of your cars

111
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,400
the day you did something about it.

112
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,360
I don't really feel people
are quite angry enough with this,

113
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,080
maybe this will help.

114
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,120
Years after finding out
definitively about the link,

115
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,280
they continued to tell families
of accident victims

116
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,960
that they did not have enough
evidence of any defect.

117
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,880
In one case, GM threatened to come
after the family of an accident victim

118
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,760
for reimbursement of legal fees if the
family did not withdraw its lawsuit.

119
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,200
GM doubled down on their awfulness,
they couldn't help themselves.

120
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,000
Much like people
stuck in their shitty cars.

121
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:37,800
This Friday, we learned that GM
"was" holding meetings at the time

122
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,360
about dealing
with their defective cars.

123
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,160
You'll never guess
what they were talking about.

124
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,360
These are slides from a Powerpoint
presentation given in 2008.

125
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,120
Workers were told not to use
the word "defect "or "defective"

126
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,160
but rather
"does not perform to design"

127
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,640
and GM had judgment words
that were banned,

128
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,280
including dangerous, crippling,
hobbling and 65 others.

129
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,840
How did they even come up
with that list ?

130
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,280
Was it just word association ?

131
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,800
Say the first word that comes
to mind. Cadillac XTS ?

132
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,720
Life-threatening.
Perfect.

133
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,560
The new Chevy Sonic.
Crippling and dangerous.

134
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,240
Fantastic. Keep 'em going,

135
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,280
there are no bad ideas here
just bad cars.

136
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,600
There were a lot more words
on that list.

137
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,760
Because the banned words include
and I'll show you the document,

138
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,600
they include "deathtrap",
"decapitating", "grenade-like",

139
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,480
"Hindenburg",
"Kevorkianesque", "powder keg",

140
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,880
"rolling Sarcophagus"
and "you're toast".

141
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:00,000
When demons have sex,
those are their safewords.

142
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,600
Luckily, GM still left us a few ways
to describe their vehicles...

143
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,520
Hell-taxis, the GM reapers,

144
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,520
and "like Hotel Rwanda,
but a car".

145
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,280
GM is clearly in deep trouble,
their only hope might be

146
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,240
that their recently appointed CEO
has something that most CEO's don't:

147
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,200
two x chromosomes.

148
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,240
GM announced
something new for 2014.

149
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,760
For the first time
in its 105 year history,

150
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,120
the company will be run
by a woman.

151
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,480
Here we have first female CEO
of the big three

152
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,560
trying to represent the new GM.

153
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,520
We discussed, whether a man or
a woman would handle this differently.

154
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,680
She is also a mother.
There will be some thinking

155
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,880
around child safety,
child accessibility

156
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,680
and just kind of the things
that moms think about.

157
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,160
Yea, Mary Barra is,
apparently unfathomably, a woman.

158
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,520
And the fact that she so stubbornly
refuses to be a man

159
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,480
means that she is forcing commentators
to define her by her gender.

160
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,720
Let's see if we can discern a woman's
touch in her handling of this crisis.

161
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,880
Her first move was to issue
an internal company letter,

162
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,960
I quote: "our process for determining
whether and when to recall a vehicle"

163
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,120
"is decided
by experienced technical experts."

164
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,520
Not really detecting
a woman's touch there.

165
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,640
Or indeed a "human's" touch.

166
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:48,720
That was when a male commentator
told her how a woman should act.

167
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,240
She's a mom with two kids.
Her first responsibility

168
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,680
isn't as CEO of the company,
it's as a mom with two children.

169
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,120
She could relate to those people
who lost their family members.

170
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,720
Right, because everyone knows
that people without kids

171
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,200
could barely give a shit
when 13 people die.

172
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,200
I don't have kids,
you tell me that

173
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,320
13 people died I'm like:
"Why are you telling me this ?"

174
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,920
I could be sleeping or counting
my disposable income.

175
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,400
You're wasting
my plentiful free time.

176
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,960
It's a classy idea ! Deploy your
own family as a human shield.

177
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,240
Or a human airbag, if you will.

178
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,800
Within days, it was clear
that Barra was actually listening.

179
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,880
As a member of the GM family
and as a mom with a family,

180
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,640
this really hits home for me.

181
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,760
There you go. That's the lady
stuff ! Getting much warmer.

182
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,640
Not as warm
as the brakes on a Cadillac XTS,

183
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,360
which could start a fire
for no apparent reason,

184
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,200
let's just say warmer though.

185
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,080
Even the new video
seems slightly off.

186
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,800
Something went wrong
with our process in this instance.

187
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,520
Terrible things happened.

188
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,520
Sounds less like "a person expressing
sympathy in a human manner"

189
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,080
and more like the distress message
from a doomed spaceship in a SF.

190
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,200
After all, something went wrong
with our process in this instance.

191
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,040
And terrible things happened.

192
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:33,040
So, to recap: Barra's first statement
had serious design flaws.

193
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,880
She introduced a second,
hastily-assembled statement

194
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,960
with many of the same catastrophic
issues as the first.

195
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:45,240
But then this week, after recalling
11.2 million cars and paying a fine

196
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,440
worth less than 24 hours
of corporate revenues,

197
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:54,400
she rolled a new statement
proudly off GM's PR assembly line:

198
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,840
CEO Mary Barra had this response:

199
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,480
"We have learned
from this recall."

200
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,720
"We will now focus on the goal
of becoming an industry safety leader."

201
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,720
"We will emerge from this
situation a stronger company."

202
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,480
Good,
you'll be a stronger company ?

203
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,440
So this was all a great thing.

204
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,160
A learning experience
and a refocusing of goals.

205
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,520
Somewhere the CEO of Blockbuster
video is going:

206
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,280
"Shit, we should've killed 13 people."
It's the magic recipe.

207
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,400
While some might see this
as yet another depressing entry

208
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,800
into annals
of corporate malfeasance,

209
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,160
let's celebrate together
a milestone:

210
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,680
at a time when women leaders
are routinely questioned

211
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,040
in ways they shouldn't be,
Mary Barra,

212
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,800
the first female CEO
of a major car company,

213
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,440
has defied gender stereotypes
and issued a statement

214
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,960
every bit as shitty
as one from a male CEO.

215
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,560
Congratulations, Mary !

216
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,760
You haven't just shattered
the glass ceiling,

217
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,680
you've been ejected
through the glass windshield.

218
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:14,520
We don't technically have
commercial breaks on this show,

219
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,400
but after this I think
we all might just need one,

220
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,840
to get away from this story.

221
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,440
So if you'll excuse us,
we'll be right back.

222
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,400
General Motors makes cars
that America can be proud of.

223
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,240
Cars you couldn't describe as
"defective", "catastrophically flawed".

224
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,040
"Gruesome, potentially-disfiguring
rolling Sarcophagi ?"

225
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,800
That's not our cars !
We make sleek,

226
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,920
non-grenade-like anti-Hindenbergs,
the opposite of Kevorkianesque.

227
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,200
Why not tell your family you love
them and come test-drive a GM car ?

228
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:57,360
Driving a GM car is so smooth,
it's like butter. And you're toast !

229
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,040
General Motors. Why walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

230
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,720
when you can drive ?

231
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:13,160
Welcome back. Let's talk about
something else, the internet.

232
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,160
In Europe this week, there was
some potentially significant news.

233
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,840
It is said the Internet
never forgets until now, that is.

234
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,000
The highest court in Europe ruled that
Google and other search operators

235
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,320
must delete search results
if they are requested,

236
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,840
the right to be forgotten.

237
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,240
The right to be forgotten,

238
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,200
which incidentally is my favorite
non-existent Morrissey song.

239
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:47,040
I have the right to be forgotten,
I have...

240
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,560
Yeah, yes.
What the ruling amounts to is,

241
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,000
if there's something embarrassing
on the Internet about you,

242
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,120
then EU citizens can now ask Google
to take down any links to it.

243
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,000
I'll tell you who seems weirdly
excited about this potential new right:

244
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,160
the newscasters reporting on it.

245
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,800
Let's hypothetically say
when you were in high school

246
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,960
you toilet papered someone's house
and were arrested.

247
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,320
The one night of wild drinking
in college can haunt you forever.

248
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,400
What if 10 million people
approach Google and say:

249
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,040
that story about
me running over a squirrel

250
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,120
on my bicycle while drunk
and naked ?

251
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,440
I want that removed.

252
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,520
That is "way" too specific
to be something

253
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,320
that he came up
with off the top of his head.

254
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,840
There is a photo of that man
naked on a bike crushing a squirrel.

255
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,000
And if there isn't,
then frankly, there is now.

256
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,360
Yes, meet your new top
Google hit, Brian Sullivan !

257
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,200
And live with this
for the rest of your life.

258
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,080
Maybe my favorite
newscaster fantasy spurred

259
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,440
by this ruling came this week
from Fox News's Shep Smith.

260
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,320
I'm trying to think what I would
give just to be forgotten.

261
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,200
I might go rob
all the banks on the planet.

262
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,360
Hold on, Shep. Just because you erased
yourself from the internet,

263
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,560
doesn't mean you won't be
caught for robbing banks.

264
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,640
That's not how
basically anything works.

265
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,120
But it's charming
that you think it is.

266
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,960
I just like to rob banks,
that's kind of my thing.

267
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,400
Maybe this new ruling though
addresses a genuine problem:

268
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,160
internet has an unforgiving memory
and it can ruin people's lives.

269
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,080
So if all the ruling does
is let people take down

270
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,920
links to minor indiscretions from
their past, it's probably fine.

271
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:03,600
A source says a man in Europe,
convicted of child pornography,

272
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,400
was among the first
to request

273
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,000
that links to articles about
his conviction be taken down.

274
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,640
A politician with
some bad behavior in office.

275
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,800
Even a doctor
with a negative review.

276
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,760
A failsafe question to ask
yourself when drafting a law is:

277
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,600
"might child pornographers
like this ?"

278
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,280
If so,
maybe take another pass at it.

279
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,200
Luckily, the only thing stopping
this ruling from doing real damage

280
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,840
is that it is, by its nature,
completely ineffective.

281
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,880
Because what the EU court
doesn't understand

282
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,840
is the internet is like quicksand.

283
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,280
The more aggressively you fight
to remove yourself from it,

284
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,240
the deeper you're going
to sink.

285
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,360
The case in point,
the guy who started all of this:

286
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,120
The case originated in Spain.
A man there argued

287
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,880
that when a Google search
turned up an auction notice

288
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,960
of his repossessed home
from back in 1998

289
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,240
that that being out there was
a violation against his privacy.

290
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,400
That Spanish man
is Mario Costeja Gonzalez.

291
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,440
This is his photo, which was on
an article from New York Times

292
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,000
about his crusade to remove links
mentioning his debts from 1998.

293
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,840
In doing so,
he is now world-famous for being

294
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,000
"that Spanish guy
with debts from 1998".

295
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,960
I know about him the only thing
he didn't want me to know.

296
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,680
That is why, all of this...

297
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,760
All of this, is why
"right to be forgotten" law

298
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,320
is no longer workable
in the Internet age.

299
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,680
Nothing you are embarrassed of
on the internet is ever going away.

300
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,200
We all have a horrifying
photo from our past

301
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,760
that undermines
the person we are now,

302
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,160
professionally and personally.

303
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,720
We can all live in fear
of that thing ever surfacing.

304
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,240
Or we can all hold hands, jump at
the same time and save each other.

305
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,320
Which is why
we're launching tonight

306
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,040
hashtag mutually assured humiliation.

307
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,840
If we all put our worst photo
into the world together,

308
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,400
none of us will ever be
in a position to judge anyone else.

309
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,920
I'm not talking about the cute,
mildly-embarrassing photo,

310
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,760
like that one of yourself,
let's say wearing

311
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,240
a homemade sweater
with your own name on it.

312
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,720
Hypothetically...

313
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,000
The kind that you claim...
That's real.

314
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,040
The kind you claim is embarrassing,
but somehow humanizes you a little.

315
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:47,280
No, I'm talking about "this".
Toxic, weapons-grade awkwardness.

316
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:54,280
I am putting this photo
up online right now.

317
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,640
We all have to do this together.
I'm trusting you to do the same.

318
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,640
Three, two, one. You have
to do this with me, right ?

319
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,640
Go.

320
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,640
You better fucking have done that
or I have made a horrible mistake.

321
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,560
And I think I've just made
a horrible mistake. And now, this.

322
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,760
And now, shame !

323
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,840
Shame on the little
totalitarians of the left.

324
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,560
- Shame on HGTV.
- Shame on Thailand, yes.

325
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,720
- Shame on the Australians.
- Shame on Warren Buffett.

326
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,680
- Shame on the legal profession.
- Shame, Hank Aaron.

327
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,480
Shame on you, Copenhagen Zoo.

328
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,160
Shame on them,
shame on you too, Chris.

329
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,480
- Shame on you guys !
- Yea, shame on us.

330
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,560
It's a Rove-down dirty shame.

331
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,960
Moving on, finally tonight.

332
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,000
You may remember
on our very first episode

333
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,240
we talked
about the election in India.

334
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,600
After five weeks
and over 500 million votes,

335
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,960
on Friday,
there was an announcement:

336
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,920
It appears at 9:37 AM
and we are calling the election

337
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,080
the BJP will have won the election
and Narendra Modi with these numbers

338
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,680
will become
the next Prime Minister of India.

339
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,680
That is a seizure-inducing amount
of information on that screen.

340
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,080
If you followed this election,
you learned two key things:

341
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,080
Narendra Modi was destined
for an historic victory.

342
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,240
And two, no one covers an election
like Indian news networks,

343
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,880
who are apparently sponsored
by Adderall.

344
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,440
We are not speeding
this footage up !

345
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:43,200
I feel like I'm playing a slot machine
while high on peyote.

346
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,160
Just a small word of advice
to Indian news networks:

347
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,560
"this" is not the most
relaxing way to watch television.

348
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,400
The only thing
this is good for

349
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,400
is potentially putting your
elderly viewers in the hospital.

350
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,600
But I digress.
Take it down !

351
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,080
The real news regarding this election
is that Narendra Modi is set

352
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,480
to become
the new Prime Minister of India.

353
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,560
He's a transformative,
albeit controversial figure.

354
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,480
Some worry he might be
too harsh and authoritarian.

355
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,840
So perhaps one of his family
members can reassure us.

356
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,720
His brother remembers
their days together.

357
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,800
Narendra Modi loved flying kites.
I had to hold a spool of string,

358
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,360
but if I refused,
he would get angry.

359
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,800
And he would hit me.

360
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,840
In Modi's defense: how difficult
is it to just hold a spool of string ?

361
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:48,800
Fuck this guy. Anyway, I'm sorry.
What you were saying ?

362
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,560
- Were you scared of your brother ?
- I'm still scared of him, even today.

363
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,800
Should India be scared of him ?

364
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,400
Anyone concerned for the well-being
of the country has nothing to fear.

365
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,200
Only those who work against
the country need to be scared.

366
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,120
That's reassuring ! He should have
run his campaign slogan on that:

367
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,280
"Don't worry, only my brother
and those who oppose me"

368
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,800
"will beaten to death
with a child's kite."

369
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,440
Here to talk more about the Indian
elections is CNN's Fareed Zakaria.

370
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,040
Fareed. Thank you so much
for being here.

371
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,520
Let's talk India.
You were born there.

372
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,080
My people were temporary
custodians. This was...

373
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,920
Temporary self-appointed custodians.
Let's just be clear.

374
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,480
We felt we were kind
of inherently invited in some way.

375
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,200
That's the excuse
of the British Empire.

376
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,680
I'm sure you were...
it was lost in the post.

377
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,480
This was an amazing election.
And it's been described the result,

378
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,320
as either an exciting
or a frightening time for Indians.

379
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,040
It's mostly exciting.
You're right. It's an amazing election.

380
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,320
Here's this guy, Modi,
the son of a tea seller,

381
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,360
himself sold tea,
really humble origins,

382
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,680
extraordinarily disciplined
politician running against

383
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,640
a political dynasty
like no other in the world.

384
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,120
This is Rahul Gandhi, the guy
he was sort of running against.

385
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,760
His father was prime minister,
his grandmother was prime minister,

386
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,320
his great-grandfather
was prime minister.

387
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:47,720
Like Chelsea Clinton's fetus having
a child and then running for president.

388
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,760
Does it have to be like that ?
Could it not be a different image ?

389
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,920
Everything about this election
was different from normal.

390
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,320
There's a great bit in one of your
books where you point out:

391
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,840
"Indian elections are not
really national elections at all."

392
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,960
Rather simultaneous regional and local
elections with no common theme.

393
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,760
But this changed this time.
He has a huge mandate.

394
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,600
This changed in a fascinating way.
Rather than regional elections,

395
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,360
what you ended up with
was one big national issue.

396
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,320
And the Congress party,
ran on really the default message

397
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,400
that every third world ruling
party runs on which is,

398
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,440
we're going to give you
subsidies.

399
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,560
A kind of socialism in action.
We're going to give you subsidies

400
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,760
you're poor,
you're entitled to them.

401
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,400
This guy said: "I'm going to run
on growth and good government."

402
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,680
Not going to give you
anything for free.

403
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,600
I'm gonna try to get good
roads, good electricity.

404
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,520
And what he banked on,
was that in India now,

405
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,680
there is an aspirational middle class

406
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,640
that doesn't want to be handed
government subsidies but wants

407
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,360
the infrastructure, the governance
that produces economic growth.

408
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,280
The Times of India
had a really interesting editorial,

409
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,320
where they referred to him
selling the Indian dream.

410
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,560
Packaging the Indian dream
to people.

411
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,760
The American dream is clear. Catching
something from a T-shirt cannon.

412
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:25,560
What is the Indian dream ?

413
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,080
Is it just the concept
of upward mobility ?

414
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,760
When you hear about this,
about the Indian dream

415
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,360
or the Chinese dream,
they're all really the American dream,

416
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,560
the idea you will do
better than your parents.

417
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,720
We franchised it. That's it.

418
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,560
It's like a supernova. Just as
it's catching on everywhere else,

419
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,280
it's imploding here at home.

420
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,600
Why does every analogy you use have
to be so appallingly negative ?

421
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,360
- This is HBO, isn't it ?
- That's true.

422
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,680
- We're testing the limits.
- It's not TV, it's negative.

423
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,440
Can you stick around
to talk online ?

424
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,600
This is a much bigger discussion
than we have time here.

425
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,920
As long as there are more
photographs you're going to post.

426
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,040
I actually have one worse than
that and I chickened out.

427
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,000
If you want to watch an extended
version of this interview, go here.

428
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,840
Fareed Zakaria, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you for joining us.

429
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:32,440
We are off next week. Have
a fantastic two weeks, good night !

430
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,240
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

431
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,280
END OF EPISODE 4
