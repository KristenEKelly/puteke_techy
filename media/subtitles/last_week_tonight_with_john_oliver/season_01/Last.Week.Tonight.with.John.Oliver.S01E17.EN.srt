1
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,960
Welcome, welcome, welcome to "Last Week Tonight."

2
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,880
I'm John Oliver. Thank you for being with us.

3
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,960
Just time for a quick recap of the week,

4
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,240
and it has been dominated here in the U.S. by the NFL,

5
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,440
the FIFA of American sports.

6
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,480
In July, there was outrage

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,280
when Ray Rice of the Baltimore Ravens

8
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,800
received just a two-game suspension

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,800
after assaulting his then-fiancee.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,840
That outrage over that decision only got louder this week

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,200
when a horrifying video of the assault was released.

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,280
Many in the world of sport
were rightly disgusted,

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,680
although often for
unnecessarily specific reasons.

14
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,440
If my daughter
was to, you know,

15
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,360
get hit like that
from another man,

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,040
you know, I'd have
a serious problem with it.

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,240
Having a daughter
and having a wife, you know,

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,880
I agree with their decision.

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,800
Take your sister,
your mom,

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,400
your significant other,

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,680
if you have a daughter,

22
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,960
and just put her face
on Janay Rice's face.

23
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,640
Now tell me, would you give the guy
a second chance then?

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,400
Or--or--here's a crazy idea--

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,840
you could put away your magic
face-switching machine

26
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,800
and just be upset
about the incident

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,920
as it actually happened.

28
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,480
Because you should not
need to insert a relative

29
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,840
into a horrifying situation
to make it horrific.

30
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,400
For instance, I hate Sea World's
treatment of whales

31
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,120
on principle alone, not just
because my father is an orca.

32
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,480
See you at Christmas, Dad.

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,840
I'll bring some fish.

34
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,840
The NFL has behaved
characteristically appallingly

35
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,800
throughout this
entire controversy.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,640
But perhaps the most amazing
response of the week

37
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,200
came from Ravens owner
Steve Bisciotti,

38
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,520
a candy apple with teeth,

39
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,920
who--who--who has admitted
failing to do enough

40
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,160
when the assault
first happened,

41
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,320
but who is now,
for some reason,

42
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,160
trying to spin this whole mess
as a positive.

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,440
If this is a seminal moment
for domestic violence

44
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,160
and the way we handle it
as a society,

45
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,400
then that's not a burden
for us to be that poster boy.

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,120
It's not.

47
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,160
Now, I'm embarrassed about it,

48
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,040
but 5 years from now,
things have changed

49
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,800
significantly for the better,
I'll be proud of it.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,680
What? "Really, you should
all be thanking me.

51
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,560
"I've handled this
situation so badly,

52
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,280
"I might accidentally instigate social progress.

53
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,800
"Think of it this way--
you don't get to Rosa Parks

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,640
"without Rosa Parks'
bus driver,

55
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,040
"and that is me!

56
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,440
"You're welcome, everyone!
You're welcome.

57
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,000
I did it!"

58
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,920
Now, moving on--
moving on, ISIS.

59
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,960
Their influence in the Middle
East grows, and on Wednesday,

60
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,960
the president announced
to the nation that yet again,

61
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,560
America would launch a military
intervention into Iraq.

62
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,480
Our objective is clear--

63
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,120
we will degrade and ultimately
destroy ISIL

64
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,040
through a comprehensive
and sustained

65
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,680
counter-terrorism strategy.

66
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,640
As Americans, we welcome
our responsibility to lead.

67
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,920
Yeah, but do we welcome
it in this case?

68
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,640
Or is it like when the printer
at work runs out of toner

69
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,360
and there's no one else around
who can fix it?

70
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,320
"Aw, shit, do I really have to
take the lead on this again?

71
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,680
Fuck! Nobody else,
nobody else."

72
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,840
Here's the problem--
almost everyone on Earth

73
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,960
would like ISIS gone.

74
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,840
And yet, understandably,
no one is eager

75
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,200
to be the one to deal with it.

76
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,200
Which is why--as difficult
as this might be--

77
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,920
Americans need to come together
and demand, with one voice,

78
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,280
that Peru should really
do something about this.

79
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,920
Seriously, Peru. Seriously.

80
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,280
ISIS, Peru, poses a threat
to the entire globe,

81
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,880
and you are just sitting there!

82
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,120
Life isn't just a fairytale land
of alpacas and pan flutes, Peru.

83
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,440
At some point, you've got to
pull your weight.

84
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,320
And don't give me the whole,
"Oh, but John,

85
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,440
"our population is
the size of Texas,

86
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,160
and the war on terror is a
hopeless geopolitical paradox!"

87
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,360
That's bullshit, Peru!

88
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,920
And also, it is not like you've
got better things to do.

89
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,360
I have seen how you people
spend your time.

90
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,320
If you have a pet,
a lot of you,

91
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,480
a lot of us have
taught the pet

92
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,880
to sit, shake,
maybe roll over.

93
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,360
What about surf?

94
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,560
MAN: A Peruvian man has trained
his pet alpaca to do just that.

95
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,640
Alpacas are from
the Andean highlands,

96
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,960
are raised by Peruvians
for their wool.

97
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,000
Pisco the alpaca, who wears
a flotation vest...

98
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,360
FEMALE NEWSCASTER: I hope so.

99
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,400
and surfs for a little while
and then eventually goes,

100
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,960
"Ooh, get me out of here!"

101
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,960
Oh, oh, oh, sure.
That looks fun.

102
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,000
But playtime's over, assholes!

103
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,920
ISIS is a menace, and it is
100% up to you, Peru,

104
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,880
to get rid of them.

105
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,920
Then, and only then,

106
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,200
do you have permission to
clamber back on a surfboard

107
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,120
with a sopping-wet alpaca.

108
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,200
And finally this week,

109
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,520
there was some big news
from the world of food.

110
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,560
Specifically, Olive Garden.

111
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,520
They started the week launching
their latest promotion.

112
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,800
Olive Garden is taking all you
can eat to a whole new level.

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,480
The chain now is introducing
a never-ending pasta pass.

114
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,960
So, for $100, you can
eat all the pasta, salad,

115
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,400
bread, and soft drinks
you want for 7 weeks.

116
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,880
7 weeks of Olive Garden food.

117
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,760
That is pretty much a one-way
ticket to the hospitaliano.

118
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,600
Now, unfortunately,
unfortunately for them,

119
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,240
their publicity bump
was undercut

120
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,040
when an activist hedge fund

121
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,680
seeking to replace
Olive Garden's management

122
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,240
released this damning report
essentially pointing out that

123
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,400
all that pasta
you can eat is shit.

124
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,920
Darden Restaurant's beating on
earnings but gets handed

125
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,280
a 300--300-slide presentation

126
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,120
from activist
hedge fund Starboard

127
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,840
with advice on how to cut costs

128
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,000
and improve its
Olive Garden chain,

129
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,960
which, of course,
that makes sense,

130
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,000
including, though, easing up
on bread, pushing more alcohol,

131
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,040
and salting the pasta water.

132
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,800
That's right.
Because according to

133
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,200
one of the slides,

134
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,080
they no longer put salt in the
water they use to boil pasta,

135
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,960
because that way,
this is the reason,

136
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,400
they get a longer warranty
on their pots.

137
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,160
Although what is
really shocking there

138
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,960
is that Olive Garden
uses pots at all.

139
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,480
I always just assumed that
they microwaved cold pasta

140
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,080
between two damp paper towels.

141
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,560
That's what it tastes like.

142
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,880
The slides--the slides go on

143
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,800
to argue that
Olive Garden serves

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,160
"a mushy, unappealing product."

145
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,200
Also, that "fried lasagna bites
are not authentic Italian,"

146
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,680
describing them
as "barely edible."

147
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,200
Also, saying of another dish,

148
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,120
"Vegetable lasagna topped with
chicken doesn't make any sense,"

149
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,920
which is fair,

150
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,000
and also that customers are
"consistently disappointed."

151
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,960
But my favorite slide
shows a photo

152
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,240
of the vegetable lasagna
on the menu,

153
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,040
and then juxtaposes that

154
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,720
with what customers
were actually served.

155
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,720
What happened there?

156
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,800
I can only presume that between
the first and the second photo,

157
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,280
that vegetable
lasagna developed

158
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,920
a massive
crystal meth addiction.

159
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,680
And if you think that
PowerPoint presentation

160
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,080
was aggressive, just wait until
you see the ads they're running

161
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,840
to shame Olive Garden
into changing its ways.

162
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,400
MAN: Come on down
to Olive Garden

163
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,840
for an inauthentic
Italian experience

164
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,360
that is guaranteed
to leave your family

165
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,840
consistently disappointed.

166
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,880
Our food is mushy, unappealing,
barely edible,

167
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,520
and looks nothing
like any of this.

168
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,360
And while you're here,
come visit our kitchen

169
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,560
to see our many still-
under-warranty pots,

170
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,640
uncorroded by any
form of seasoning

171
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,200
that might pleasure
a customer's mouth.

172
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,240
That's why we have some of
the oldest pots around.

173
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,000
In fact, think of us
as a pot museum

174
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,080
that occasionally serves
something resembling food.

175
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,080
Because we care about them a lot
more than we care about you.

176
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,920
But our main story--

177
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,880
our main story
this week is Scotland.

178
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,720
Americans know it as
the birthplace of Shrek

179
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,920
and that accent you think you
can do but actually can't.

180
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,920
Well, this coming Thursday,

181
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,880
Scotland is facing a major decision.

182
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,440
MAN: Scotland will
vote this week

183
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,400
on whether to leave
the United Kingdom.

184
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,920
For the first time
in modern history,

185
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,800
London could be at risk of
losing control of Scotland.

186
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,880
It could become
its own country.

187
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,600
Yes, it seems like England
may lose yet another country.

188
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,440
And look, look, I'm not saying

189
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,920
the sun is setting
on the British empire.

190
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,320
Let's just say
the restaurant of history

191
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,560
is switching to its
dinner menu.

192
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,800
Now, now, there is
a lot to explain here,

193
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,280
especially because when
most American people

194
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,880
think about
Scottish independence,

195
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,760
they tend to picture this.

196
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:37,720
They may take our lives, but
they'll never take our freedom!

197
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,120
Ah, yes, nothing screams
"Scottish freedom" quite like

198
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,120
a millionaire Australian
anti-Semite on horseback.

199
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,640
So--so--let me--let me
bring you up to date here.

200
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,480
Scotland is currently a member
of the United Kingdom,

201
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,960
which is not a country.

202
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,400
It's actually a complicated political and economic union.

203
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,520
Think of it as
an archipelagic supergroup

204
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,480
comprised of 4 variously
willing members.

205
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,280
And to understand why
Scotland may want to leave,

206
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,320
you really need to understand
the history

207
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,560
of its relationship
with England.

208
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,200
MAN: For centuries, England
and Scotland remained separate

209
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,760
and frequently at war.

210
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,400
But in 1707, they formed a
single country, Great Britain,

211
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,920
a decision that's
been controversial

212
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,880
in Scotland ever since.

213
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,480
Oh, yeah, I'd say it's still
controversial, given that--

214
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,920
as you can see here--
we are still

215
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,520
role-playing with wooden swords

216
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,680
to try and emotionally
work through it.

217
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,800
So, Scotland and England have
been involved in something of a

218
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,760
300-year arranged marriage.

219
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,520
And look, I will be
the first one to acknowledge,

220
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,680
England has been a little bit
of a dick since the honeymoon.

221
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,800
In 1746, we actually
banned the kilt,

222
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,880
just because we knew
they liked it.

223
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,560
And then we chose
"God Save the King"

224
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,280
as the U.K.'s national anthem,
a song which at one point

225
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,040
had a verse referencing
"Rebellious Scots to crush."

226
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,760
Although--although to be fair,
we later realized that was wrong

227
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,400
and replaced it with a line
about pissing on the Welsh.

228
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,280
But 2 1/2 years ago, it was
announced that Scotland would

229
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,920
finally get to vote
on its independence.

230
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,080
And since then, there has been
a spirited campaign.

231
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,680
WOMAN: There are
two campaigns--

232
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,560
"Yes, Scotland,"
backed by the S.N.P.

233
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,400
and the Scottish Greens,
and "Better Together."

234
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,640
OK, for a start,
"Better Together"

235
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,240
is not a great name
for a campaign.

236
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,480
It sounds like what people say
to convince themselves

237
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,360
to stay in a dead marriage.

238
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,080
"Look, look, I'm not saying
we're good together, Marion.

239
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,520
"I'm saying we're
better together.

240
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,840
"Tax-wise, it's preferable
to the alternative.

241
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,880
Why are you crying, Marion?
I'm saying something nice."

242
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,840
And if you think their
name is uninspiring,

243
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,240
wait until you hear
their slogan.

244
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,240
No, thanks.

245
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,600
No, thanks.

246
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,840
No, thanks.

247
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,040
No, thanks.

248
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:04,280
No, thanks is a violently
British way to refuse something.

249
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,880
That is just one step away from
"Oh, I couldn't possibly."

250
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,160
But--but what is--what's--what's
even more interesting here

251
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,320
is who is helping fund
these two campaigns.

252
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,040
"Harry Potter" author
J.K. Rowling

253
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,920
wants Scotland to stay
part of the U.K.

254
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,840
Rowling has
donated $1.6 million

255
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,320
to the Better
Together campaign.

256
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,320
Yeah, but that's not
really a surprise, is it?

257
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,720
She famously wrote a book where
a redhead played second fiddle

258
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,320
to a magical Englishman.

259
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,920
"Come along, Ron.
Come along.

260
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,080
"I shall have all the powers,

261
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,560
"and your brothers can die
fighting my wars.

262
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,480
Come along, come along."

263
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,640
Meanwhile, meanwhile,
the opposing side has received

264
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,880
80% of its funding from
these two people.

265
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,120
WOMAN: Jackpot!
A Scottish couple scoop

266
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,320
161 million pounds
on the lottery,

267
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,880
making them Europe's
biggest-ever winners.

268
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,560
That's right.
The pro-independence campaign

269
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,320
is predominantly financed
by lottery winners.

270
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,240
They're like an adorable
Scottish version

271
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,960
of the Koch brothers.

272
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,440
So--so let's just look
at the two arguments.

273
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,360
First, the case in favor
of Scottish independence.

274
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,120
We can take matters
into Scottish hands.

275
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,440
No one, absolutely no one, will
run the affairs of this country

276
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,840
better than the people who
live and work in Scotland.

277
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,920
And to be fair, he might
be right about that.

278
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,480
Scots know how
to run a country.

279
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,480
Because when they got to choose
a national animal,

280
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:38,680
they selected--and I swear
this is true--a unicorn.

281
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,960
Who knew you were
allowed to do that?

282
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,960
Pick a fictional animal?
Yeah. Yeah.

283
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,800
America's probably
kicking itself for choosing

284
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,480
the bald eagle now, aren't you?

285
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,760
You could've picked
a Wookiee in a top hat,

286
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,720
or whatever the fuck
Grimace is. Look.

287
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,040
He looks like a magic genie

288
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,160
granted a wish to
Gorbachev's birthmark.

289
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,400
But--and also--also,
for their national flower,

290
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,200
the Scots chose a thistle.

291
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,360
That is a plant made
out of tiny knives

292
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,800
and a throwing staff!

293
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,520
"The only flower I like
is a flower that could

294
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,760
pierce an Englishman's throat!"

295
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,880
And look, look, there are
legitimate reasons

296
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,200
for Scotland to want
to govern itself.

297
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,680
For instance, it's a
predominantly liberal country,

298
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,240
which has frequently been
governed by a conservative

299
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,440
U.K. government.

300
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,000
And seldom has that divide
been more pronounced

301
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,560
than right now, when the U.K.'s
prime minister is David Cameron.

302
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,000
MAN: Cameron's problem is that
as a posh southern Tory,

303
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,960
he's seen in Scotland as the
personification of everything

304
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,040
that's wrong with
England and the U.K.

305
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,560
Yeah, I agree with that.

306
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,440
He embodies all the things
I hate most about England,

307
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,920
and I'm English!

308
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,240
Let me prove this to you.

309
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,200
This is a picture of him
as a student at Oxford.

310
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,960
He's in fucking tails!

311
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,200
Now, Cameron says he's

312
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,040
desperately embarrassed
by that photo,

313
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,120
which is why it pains me so much
to be showing it to you.

314
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,960
Can we get a close-up
on his face?

315
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,840
Because that is
the face of a man

316
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,800
who fast-forwards through
the servant parts

317
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,880
of "Downton Abbey."
Just--"Uh. Uh."

318
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,480
"Who cares what's
happening downstairs? Uh.

319
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,200
Let's just hope the soup
doesn't get cold."

320
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,800
In fact, let me show you what
an asshole David Cameron is.

321
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,240
One of the biggest issues
in the independence debate

322
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,640
concerns the fact
that Scotland has

323
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,960
a surprisingly large
amount of oil.

324
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,040
But watch how
David Cameron responded

325
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,960
to a simple
parliamentary question

326
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,280
about who should control
revenues from it.

327
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,800
A poll last week
showed that 68% of Scots

328
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,440
want oil revenues
devolved to Scotland.

329
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,000
Does the prime minister agree

330
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,960
with 68% of Scots,
or does he not?

331
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,160
If, uh...

332
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,120
if you ask a stupid question,
you get a stupid answer.

333
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,960
Waaa, waaa, waaa!
Waaa, waaa, waaa, waaa, waaa!

334
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,760
Imagine that sound
for 300 years,

335
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,680
and it gives you some sense
of why Scotland

336
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,000
may be ready to leave.

337
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,240
OK, so, let's look at the
anti-independence campaign now.

338
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,920
Clearly, they had some
serious work to do.

339
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,520
Unfortunately, their attempts
to win hearts and minds

340
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,960
involved this controversial
commercial, targeted at women,

341
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,680
featuring a Scottish mother

342
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,440
confused by the whole
concept of independence

343
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,280
who has just sent her kids
off to school.

344
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,400
Best time of the day, this.
When they're all out.

345
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,080
Nice and quiet.
Gives you time to think.

346
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,440
Helps you clear your head.

347
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,520
Shame it only lasts
for two minutes.

348
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,480
Don't get me wrong, I know
how important this vote is.

349
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,680
There's not much time left
for me to make a decision.

350
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,440
But there's only so many
hours in the day.

351
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:01,040
"Oh! It's so confusing!
It hurts my wee head!

352
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,560
"I'm just a woman.

353
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,600
"Y'know, just a pair of ovaries
and some bangs.

354
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,920
"How do I possibly have
the mental capacity

355
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,640
"to pick from one
of two options?

356
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,080
"Put me down for a "no,"
and never trust me

357
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,120
with an important
decision again."

358
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,880
What is--what's crazy
about this--

359
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,240
the crazy thing about this is
that the anti-independence side

360
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,840
actually has some legitimate
arguments to make.

361
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,880
Leaving the U.K. could
potentially have some serious

362
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,760
consequences for Scotland.

363
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,040
MAN: If they vote
for independence,

364
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,840
Scots have been warned
that they risk

365
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,240
losing the pound
as their currency.

366
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,080
Yeah, they could lose the pound,
and that's not nothing.

367
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,040
Because if they do,
they'd either have to join

368
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,440
the currently-unstable Euro
or revert to Scotland's

369
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,000
old currency, which I believe
was sheep and threats.

370
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,360
"I'll give you 3 sheep for it
and a punch in the face.

371
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,040
Do we have a fucking deal?"

372
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
Why do they hate us?

373
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,040
And--and also, while
the pro-independence campaign

374
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,720
has put a great deal of
emphasis on Scotland's oil,

375
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,880
there are genuine concerns over
how much might actually be left.

376
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,560
MAN: Reserves are dwindling.

377
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,400
The Office for
Budget Responsibility

378
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,880
expects the number of barrels
produced to decline from

379
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,800
two million a day in 2012 to
just half a million in 2040.

380
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,600
And if that's true,
that might be a problem,

381
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
because if you've ever
been there, you will know that

382
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,800
solar power is not
an option for Scotland.

383
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,920
So, those are the two sides.

384
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,960
And with the vote
just days away,

385
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,680
this thing is set to
go down to the wire.

386
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,880
WOMAN: This morning in shock,
Brits woke up

387
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,560
to headlines like these--

388
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,760
"Don't let me be the last
queen of Scotland,"

389
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,800
"Last stand to keep the union."

390
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,800
A new poll for the U.K.
"Sunday Times" newspaper shows

391
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,440
51% of Scots plan to vote
yes for independence.

392
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,880
And if it comes down to just
one vote, we all know

393
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,200
who will be called upon
to break that tie.

394
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,840
Go with your gut, Nessie.
You do you, Nessie.

395
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,560
You do you.

396
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,920
It seems--it seems like

397
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,600
there is a real chance that
Scotland may leave.

398
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,480
And if they do,
just so you know,

399
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,040
there are going to be some
significant consequences

400
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,880
for everybody.

401
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,960
MAN: They might also
have to say cheerio

402
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,640
to something more symbolic,
the beloved Union Jack.

403
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,200
You see, the current flag,
which hasn't changed

404
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,840
in over 200 years,
is a mix between

405
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,960
England's cross of St. George,

406
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,920
Scotland's cross of St. Andrew,

407
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,960
and Ireland's cross
of St. Patrick.

408
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,040
The government could
ditch the blue and white

409
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,720
cross of St. Andrew for
something that looks like this.

410
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,400
Oh, great. Great.
Well, there goes

411
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,040
my fucking bedspread,

412
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,040
my shower curtain, my wallpaper,
and my dog.

413
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,280
Unbelievable.
We can't do it.

414
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,040
But it--it is not just flags
that are a cause for concern.

415
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,640
There is also the small
matter of this.

416
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,480
The Scottish National Party
wants to get rid

417
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,800
of the nuclear weapons that are
currently based in Scotland

418
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,320
and ship them back to England,
and that would be a huge problem

419
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,840
for the United Kingdom.

420
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,960
Yeah, that would also be a huge
problem for everybody,

421
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,520
because we have nowhere
to keep them right now.

422
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,960
I guess we could disguise them
as Buckingham Palace guards,

423
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,640
but people are going to
notice that after a while.

424
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,560
And Scotland wants
those weapons gone.

425
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,800
Their leaders have described
them as--and I quote--

426
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,400
"an affront to basic decency."

427
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,840
And this is coming from
the land of the haggis,

428
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,480
a boiled sheep's stomach
stuffed with organ meat.

429
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,920
It is no wonder
the British government

430
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,080
is suddenly panicking.

431
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,160
They are scrambling to
make nice with Scotland,

432
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,960
but here's the problem--when
you haven't been nice to someone

433
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,320
for a thousand years, it's very
difficult to suddenly start.

434
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,480
For instance, last week, they
tried raising the Scottish flag

435
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,880
over 10 Downing Street.

436
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,960
Watch how that went.

437
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,320
MAN: On the roof
of Downing Street,

438
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,600
on the orders of the prime
minister, no less.

439
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,000
A moment of high symbolism.

440
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh, dear.

441
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,360
And it's not as though everything

442
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,800
was going swimmingly before.

443
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,200
That's right.

444
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,480
Not even English flag poles

445
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,960
can suddenly start
treating Scotland

446
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,920
with the respect it deserves.

447
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,200
"Get this rag off me!

448
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,960
"Get it off.
I can't.

449
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,320
Get this blue mess off me!"

450
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,880
And, and in a last-ditch effort,
David Cameron has even tried,

451
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,360
like a romantic hero,
to turn up at Scotland's door

452
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,320
and plead for them,
plead for them not to leave.

453
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,920
I would be heartbroken
if this family of nations

454
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,960
that we've put together,

455
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,200
and that we've done such
amazing things together,

456
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,800
if this family of nations
was torn apart.

457
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,400
That's it?

458
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,960
That's the best
pleading you've got?

459
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,600
There are only 4 days left.

460
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,680
Look, if I've learned one thing

461
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,680
from the last 4 minutes of
British romantic comedies,

462
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,560
it's that's if you're trying
to win someone over,

463
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,960
you need a big
romantic gesture.

464
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,960
A kiss in the rain.
A kiss in the snow.

465
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,280
Turning up to someone's door
with romantic signs

466
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,800
expressing your love for them,

467
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,960
because you can't say it
out loud because her husband,

468
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,120
your best friend,
is in the next room,

469
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:12,440
which is a bit fucked-up,
but, but, but it is effective.

470
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,920
It's effective.
So, with that in mind,

471
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,600
let's do this,
because right now, Scotland,

472
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,200
I'm just a boy, standing
in front of a nation,

473
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,880
asking it to continue
tolerating me.

474
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,880
You want me to show you
what I'm

475
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,920
willing to do to save
this relationship?

476
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,280
Here, I will eat some haggis.
Look. I'll do it.

477
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,800
Mmm. Mmm.
Oh. Oh, yes.

478
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,640
Mmm, sheep lungs.

479
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,680
There are literally
sheep lungs in my mouth.

480
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:47,240
Let me just wash that down with
some fine Scottish whiskey.

481
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,120
like a delicious house fire!

482
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,800
Look at me, Scotland.
I'm drunk on scotch,

483
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,040
I'm trying to choke back
sheep-lung vomit,

484
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,240
so kiss me, Scotland.

485
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,560
What do you mean
this isn't enough?

486
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,960
Look! Look!
Here's your national animal!

487
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,240
There it is.
Hello, unicorn. Hello.

488
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,760
And if that's not enough, I'll
make the ultimate sacrifice.

489
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,480
Oh, yes.
That's right,

490
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:20,520
I will feign enjoyment
of bagpipe music,

491
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,000
the atonal death squeal
of your people.

492
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,240
I believe this particular song

493
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,880
is called "Cat Bronchitis
in A minor."

494
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,360
And I love it.

495
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,000
In fact, there's just
one problem--

496
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,000
it's simply not loud enough.

497
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,920
MAN: And now,
newscasters misidentifying

498
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,960
photographs as selfies.

499
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:12,600
WOMAN: Team U.S.A.
taking this selfie.

500
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,520
WOMAN: He even finds time
for the obligatory selfie.

501
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,680
WOMAN: How often do you get
a selfie with a lemur?

502
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,560
WOMAN: There's even a doggy
selfie station.

503
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,760
MAN: Look at him.
Ooh. Nice.

504
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,400
That's a selfie.

505
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,960
MAN: That's the back of a pickup
truck rolling down the highway.

506
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,920
That's a selfie, huh?

507
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:49,520
MAN: That is
the ultimate selfie.

508
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,760
And finally tonight,

509
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,120
finally tonight, Twitter.

510
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,960
It's not just for pithy
observations, dick pics,

511
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,000
or messages to your favorite
One Direction member

512
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,840
who for some reason
never responds to you.

513
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,160
What is wrong, Liam?

514
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,080
What part of "u up?"
don't you understand?

515
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,800
It has also become
a valuable venue

516
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,800
for hashtag discussions
on serious social issues.

517
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,840
For instance, this week,

518
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,800
after the release of
the Ray Rice video,

519
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,960
Twitter was the home
for a national conversation

520
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,840
about domestic violence.

521
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,120
On the hashtags, "Why I stayed"
and "Why I left,"

522
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,400
brave survivors are exposing
the vicious cycle of abuse.

523
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,280
MAN: Because every time
was the last time.

524
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,240
#whyistayed.

525
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,880
And because I was pregnant

526
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,840
and wanted my daughter
to have a dad.

527
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,680
#whyistayed.

528
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,840
Now, that is clearly
a positive tool.

529
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,480
Giving victims a voice
and providing everyone else

530
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,800
a glimpse into the complicated
realities of the issue.

531
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,440
The problem is when something
like this then happens.

532
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,640
Pizza maker DiGiorno
is under fire tonight

533
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,520
about using a Twitter hashtag
about domestic violence

534
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,800
in order to promote itself.

535
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,960
A message saying "You had pizza"
with the hashtag "Why I stayed."

536
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,840
Wow, DiGiorno.
That is a fuckup.

537
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,840
I did not think
you could do anything

538
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,360
more viscerally offensive than
produce a microwaveable pizza,

539
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,440
but I was wrong.

540
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,800
Here is the problem--

541
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,280
Twitter conversations
and corporations don't mix.

542
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,840
For instance, there was a tweet
this week marking 9/11

543
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,120
saying today is the 13th
anniversary of 9/11.

544
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,080
We remember those lost
and honor those

545
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,320
still fighting for freedom.

546
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,440
#911never forget.

547
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,880
It's a fine tweet.

548
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,960
It's just a little weird
that it came from--

549
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,800
and this is true--Fleshlight,

550
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,400
the famous purveyors of
fake vaginas on a stick.

551
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,360
And look, I--I hate to sound
old-fashioned here,

552
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,240
but when in deep grief,
I don't want to hear anything

553
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,600
from a cylinder topped
with a silicone replica

554
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,920
of a woman's genitals you can
stick your dick in.

555
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,400
You really want that cylinder
to remain respectfully silent.

556
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,760
And it wasn't just Fleshlight.

557
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,600
The Build-a-Bear Workshop
tweeted this picture

558
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,560
of a bear wearing camouflage,

559
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,360
and Medieval Times
posted this image.

560
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:16,120
Oh, yes, those horses will never
forget where they were on 9/11,

561
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,400
presumably because they were in
a dark basement in New Jersey,

562
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,720
being fed rotten carrots
by a suburban teenager

563
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,960
dressed as a squire.

564
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,200
But that's not the point.

565
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,560
That's not the point.

566
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,000
Look. Look, companies.

567
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,120
Your silence is never
going to be controversial.

568
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,400
No one will ever go,
"I can't believe it.

569
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,560
"Skittles didn't tweet
about 9/11 yesterday.

570
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,240
"They must support terrorism.

571
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,920
I'm never eating them again."

572
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,520
And yet, companies keep trying
to get involved in conversations

573
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,560
they have no business being in.

574
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,000
On Martin Luther King Jr. Day,
Popchips posted a quote

575
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,240
referring to him as
"an eternal poptimist."

576
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,320
On--on Pearl Harbor's
anniversary,

577
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,640
SpaghettiOs
tweeted this picture

578
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,960
of a SpaghettiO holding an American flag.

579
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,960
And when Casey Anthony
was acquitted

580
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,800
and "not guilty" was trending,

581
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Entenmann's got involved,
tweeting,

582
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,080
"Who's hashtag not guilty

583
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,000
about eating all the tasty
treats they want?"

584
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,880
Not only is that offensive,
it's basically pointless.

585
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,000
The best and only advertising
Entenmann's needs

586
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,960
is a circular yellow sticker
that says

587
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,920
"Only one dollar" on it.

588
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,720
That's it.

589
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,480
Because that's what
corporations don't understand.

590
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,680
Twitter is a cocktail party,

591
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,920
where friends and strangers
can meet and chat.

592
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,640
Corporations don't
belong there.

593
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,480
It's like having Tony the Tiger
burst into a conversation

594
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,960
and say, "They're grrrreat!

595
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,960
"Right, guys?

596
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,000
Whatever you were
talking about."

597
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,520
"Tony, we were talking about
Megan's abortion.

598
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,280
"What is wrong with you?

599
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,000
"Why are you even here, Tony?

600
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,400
Get out of here, Tony!"

601
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,400
So, so, with that in mind,

602
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,680
I would like to speak directly
to corporations,

603
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,760
because I think I have an appropriate hashtag game

604
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,480
that I would love you to play.

605
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,040
It's called hashtag
"We understand

606
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,600
"that as corporate entities our
presence in certain discussions

607
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,080
"is not always required,
so we will strive

608
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,600
to limit our activities
to just selling you shit."

609
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,520
And if any of you are thinking,

610
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,840
"Well, that's too long,"
it's not.

611
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,600
It's exactly 140 characters,

612
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,960
so you can't fuck it up
by adding anything else.

613
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,640
If any officially verified
business tweets this,

614
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,080
we will retweet it
from our account,

615
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,320
on the solemn understanding
that the next time

616
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,400
there's a hashtag out there
that seems popular,

617
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,400
you will stay the fuck
out of it.

618
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,240
That is our show. Thank you so much for
watching this week.

619
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,040
We'll see you again next Sunday.
Good night!
