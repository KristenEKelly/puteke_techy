1
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,160
Welcome! Welcome!

2
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,240
Welcome, welcome, welcome to "Last Week Tonight."

3
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,800
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,240
Just time for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,240
In a nutshell: Gaza--horrific;

6
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,600
Ebola spreading;

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,200
and Syria, to be honest, it's barely

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,880
being reported on, but let's assume it's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,200
still fucking awful.

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,200
Thankfully for all of our souls, though, in Uganda,

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,600
there was one genuinely good piece of news this week.

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,880
A controversial and much-protested anti-gay law

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,880
in Uganda was
invalidated today.

14
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,160
Yes!

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,840
That is fantastic!

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,920
Uganda's brutal anti-gay
law has been struck down.

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,720
Presumably, this was
a simple case of a country

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,440
finally coming to its
senses and understanding

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,920
the dignity and worth
of all individuals.

20
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,920
The country's
constitutional court

21
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,880
ruled that it was
"Null and void"

22
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,040
because the parliament
didn't have a quorum when

23
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,240
it was passed
earlier this year.

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,800
Well, that's even better!

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,840
It was overturned
on a technicality!

26
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,200
"Free at last, free at last.

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,880
"Thank God Almighty,

28
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,040
we are
accidentally free at last!"

29
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,800
It still counts.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,600
It still counts.

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,920
Now, you may remember, we
actually covered Uganda's

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,440
anti-gay laws a while
ago, and we all met one

33
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,040
of its main proponents,
Pastor Martin Ssempa.

34
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,560
They begin to use
gadgets like bananas.

35
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,320
They use carrots.
They use bananas.

36
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,600
They use cucumbers and
other metallized ones,

37
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,120
and they put them inside
themselves.

38
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,520
Maybe tiny coconuts.

39
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,000
OK. Just to be clear,
what you're describing

40
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,800
isn't a sexual
orientation.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,080
It's a juice cleanse, OK?

42
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,200
Which, by the way, is
an abomination before God.

43
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,160
It's wrong. It's wrong.

44
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,080
But surprisingly--perhaps
unsurprisingly, Ssempa

45
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,360
was not thrilled
with this law being

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,480
overturned, and he thinks
he knows who is to blame.

47
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,040
Barack Obama,
who has been putting

48
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,000
pressure in
the U.S.-Africa summit.

49
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,960
Wait. President Obama
was responsible?

50
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,280
That could actually be
the most ignorant thing

51
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,000
this man has said so far
because it is one thing

52
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,000
to believe that gay sex
involves a complete

53
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,800
edible arrangement,
but if you truly believe

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,840
President Obama
has the power to influence

55
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,560
legislation anywhere
on Earth, you are

56
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,800
a complete idiot.

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,200
And--moving on.

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,920
Speaking of
the president, he ended

59
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,640
this week having to deal
with the imminent release

60
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,360
of a major report on
the CIA and torture.

61
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,800
Leaks suggest that this
country is about to have

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,440
to confront the brutality
that has been committed

63
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,680
in its name,
and the president attempted to

64
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,920
prepare us all for that
in a bizarrely casual way.

65
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,760
We did some things
that were wrong.

66
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,920
We did a whole lot of
things that were right,

67
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,840
but we tortured
some folks.

68
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,640
What?

69
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,440
Folks?

70
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,720
When you're admitting
one of the darkest chapters

71
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,840
in recent American history,
it's maybe best

72
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,800
not to come off
like an old man

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,640
in a Country Time Lemonade
commercial.

74
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,920
"Well, that was the day
I met your grandmother.

75
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,440
"We spent the whole
afternoon at

76
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,600
"the county fair.

77
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,800
"Then that night,
we tortured some folks.

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
"We did it,
and we've been together.

79
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,040
That's our story."

80
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,520
Even the CIA's conduct
towards the Senate

81
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,800
committee that wrote
the report is proving to

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,160
be controversial.

83
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,880
Back in March,
Dianne Feinstein accused them

84
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,520
of hacking into the Senate
committee's computers,

85
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,600
which, CIA Director John Brennan
thought sounded crazy.

86
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
The allegations of,
you know, CIA hacking

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,800
into, you know, Senate
computers, nothing could

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
be further
from the truth.

89
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,360
We wouldn't do that.

90
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,040
I mean that's--that's
just beyond

91
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,600
the, you know,
the scope of reason.

92
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,480
Uh-huh, uh-huh, OK.

93
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,360
Beyond the scope of
reason, uh-huh, uh-huh.

94
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,600
I get it.

95
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,960
Guess what.

96
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,960
CIA Director John Brennan
apologized today after

97
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,800
an internal investigation
determined the agency had

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,120
spied on staff members of
the United States Senate.

99
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,160
OK. So it wasn't so much
beyond the scope of reason

100
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,960
as it was nestled extremely deep
within the scope of reason.

101
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,400
Just all up in that
scope of reason.

102
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,080
Right up in there.

103
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,400
This man has either
lied to senators or been

104
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,360
guilty of not knowing
what his own agency was doing.

105
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,880
At the very least, this has got to knock

106
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,840
the president's confidence
in John Brennan, right?

107
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,760
I have full confidence
in John Brennan.

108
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,800
How? How?

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,960
How is that possible?

110
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,960
The only way you can have
full, 100% confidence

111
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,120
in him is if you somehow
had 300% confidence

112
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,000
in him before all
of this happened.

113
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,800
In fact, Mr. President,
let me try and put this in terms

114
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,280
you might understand.

115
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,480
You really might want
to consider disciplining

116
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,000
some folks.

117
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,160
And finally, to some
lighter news right here

118
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,960
in New York.

119
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,160
Fishs Eddy is
a local independent

120
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,600
kitchenware store.

121
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,280
They make delightful
plates featuring

122
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,160
New York's skyline,
but this week they ran into some

123
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,160
unexpected trouble
with a government agency.

124
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,120
NEWSWOMAN: Last week,
a Port Authority attorney

125
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,480
fired off a letter
to Fishs Eddy.

126
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,040
According to the letter,
"Your use of

127
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,440
"the Port Authority's assets
on dinnerware and other

128
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,240
items is of great concern
to the Port Authority."

129
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,720
DIFFERENT NEWSWOMAN: The store
was also told the use

130
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,920
of the images interferes
with the Port Authority's

131
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,960
control of its
own reputation.

132
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,960
That's right, that's right.

133
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,960
The Port Authority
is anxious to protect

134
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,160
its reputation.

135
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,320
And here is something
the Port Authority clearly

136
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,080
does not understand--its
reputation is terrible.

137
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,360
Because the only thing
people think of when they

138
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,080
hear its name is the
Port Authority bus terminal,

139
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,440
also known as
the single worst place

140
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,440
on planet Earth.

141
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,840
It is--let me
explain how bad.

142
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,960
It is a place--it's
a place where cockroaches

143
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,440
run up to people
screaming,

144
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,760
"Please get me out of here.

145
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,800
This place is
disgusting."

146
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,960
The Port Authority is
so famously awful that

147
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,440
the sitcom "Everybody
Hates Chris" once had

148
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,320
an episode called "Everybody
Hates the Port Authority,"

149
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,200
which featured this scene.

150
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,280
ROCHELLE: OK. I want y'all to be real
careful in here.

151
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,560
This place is full of
pickpockets, pimps,

152
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,800
and murderers and child
molesters and thieves.

153
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,840
ADULT CHRIS: That's
the Port Authority slogan.

154
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,920
And the producers were
safe in the knowledge

155
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,840
that everyone would
understand that joke

156
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,400
because you do not need
to have been to

157
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,920
the Port Authority to
know that you never

158
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,920
want to go there.

159
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,680
And yet the Port Authority
is worried that

160
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,000
a whimsical plate
will destroy its reputation.

161
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,000
Well, look, if they
really want to take

162
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,360
ownership of their
hard-earned image,

163
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,960
maybe we can be of some help.

164
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,840
ANNOUNCER: New York,
home to such icons as

165
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,760
the Empire State Building,
the Statue of Liberty,

166
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,200
and, of course,
the Port Authority Bus Terminal,

167
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,080
the Big Apple's
magnificent worm.

168
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,720
If you really want to
know the Port Authority's

169
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,240
reputation,
just ask any New Yorker.

170
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,760
The Port Authority
is pretty gross.

171
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,120
I think it's
fucking disgusting.

172
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,200
It's kind of skuzzy.

173
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,520
It really creeps me out.

174
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
It's kind of like
a dumpy shithole

175
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,040
from the eighties.

176
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,560
ANNOUNCER: And in tribute to
this great building, we're

177
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,960
proud to introduce
the official

178
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,880
Port Authority dinner plate.

179
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,760
Handcrafted from
Port Authority bathroom tiles,

180
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,160
the plate features
all the most famous

181
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,320
Port Authority sights:

182
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,280
an old woman throwing
up in a garbage can;

183
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,800
an unattended child;

184
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,160
a rat orgy;

185
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,520
a man relieving himself
into a water fountain;

186
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,800
a used condom
and 3 loose teeth;

187
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,120
and two pregnant women
fist fighting.

188
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,080
The official Port Authority
dinner plate.

189
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,240
Eat shit!

190
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,080
Mmm! Oh, beautiful, beautiful.

191
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,680
Moving on.

192
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,800
There was an amazing
international story

193
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,240
this week that you
may have missed.

194
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,320
Argentina is in default
for the second time

195
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,760
in 13 years.

196
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,480
Last-minute talks
failed to produce a deal

197
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,920
with the country's
bondholders, demanding

198
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,040
payment overnight.

199
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,240
Now Argentina
has defaulted.

200
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,480
Now Argentina
defaulting is not,

201
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,840
in itself, startling.

202
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,840
They've done it
7 times before.

203
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,600
Defaulting is
an Argentine tradition every

204
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,800
bit as grand as the tango
and hiding Nazis, both

205
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,680
of which they are
flamboyantly good at.

206
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,920
And you may be thinking,
"Well, look, this is

207
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,840
"horrible for the people
of Argentina, who are

208
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,000
"clearly in for
a very difficult time,

209
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,560
but what does this story
have to do with me?"

210
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,000
Well...

211
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,640
NEWSMAN: There is
a deep-seated resentment

212
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,880
against the United States
in Argentina nowadays.

213
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,720
People there say
the world's most powerful

214
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
country is driving
their financially strapped

215
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,520
nation into the abyss.

216
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,080
That's an unpleasant
surprise because normally

217
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,400
if you see someone
burning an American flag,

218
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,000
you can at the very
least guess why.

219
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,480
Pakistan--well,
probably drone strikes.

220
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,880
Iran--let's say
crippling sanctions.

221
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,480
College campus--looks
like Tyler just learned

222
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,040
about the military-industrial
complex.

223
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,280
"Hey, this is
bullshit, man!"

224
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,000
"I ain't gonna take it"

225
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,600
"No, Tyler ain't
gonna take it"

226
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,000
But interestingly,
this time, the flag is not

227
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,360
burning due to the actions
of the U.S. government

228
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,720
as much as it is
some U.S. hedge funds.

229
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,520
NEWSWOMAN: The dispute
began when Argentina

230
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,920
financially collapsed
in 2001 and couldn't pay

231
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,200
its debts.

232
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,200
Most investors owed money
have agreed to accept

233
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,200
repayments of as little
as 25 cents for each

234
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,400
dollar spent, but a group
of U.S. hedge funds known

235
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,800
as hold-out investors
have refused and have

236
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,560
taken Argentina to court
to get their money.

237
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,440
Now, I know that you are
on the edge of your seats

238
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,800
at this point.

239
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,400
Hedge funds, foreign bonds,
and court-ordered

240
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,920
debt restructuring?

241
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,880
You don't often get
a single story with all 3 active

242
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,200
ingredients in a bottle
of NyQuil, but how is it

243
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,600
possible for a hedge
fund, which is, by

244
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,440
definition, run by
a small group

245
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,120
of extremely rich
assholes--That's a fact--

246
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,960
how is it possible for
them to bring Argentina

247
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,600
to the precipice
of default?

248
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,000
Well, luckily, there is
a hyperexcited financial

249
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,720
reporter from "Reuters"
who is anxious to explain

250
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,200
this to you.

251
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,800
FELIX SALMON: How
exciting is this, people?

252
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,960
I get to bring out my
Legos again and bring out

253
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,880
my toys and use it to
explain to you what

254
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,920
is going on.

255
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,320
Oh, no, no.

256
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,560
Why does he have
to be English?

257
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,800
Why?

258
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,400
And not just English.

259
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,000
His name is actually
Felix Salmon, which

260
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,840
sounds like what
the Queen would feed her cat.

261
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,600
But, look, I'm
sorry, Felix.

262
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,000
You were explaining.

263
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,720
So what happens is that
every so often there's

264
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
a coupon payment.

265
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,720
And the train goes
choo-choo-choo through

266
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,680
Clearstream
and various other bits

267
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,880
of financial intermediaries.

268
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,000
These people owe those
people money, and unless

269
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,840
those people have money,
you're not allowed to

270
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,120
do anything.

271
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,840
Felix, Felix, stop.

272
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,600
Stop, Felix.

273
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,360
How are you somehow
managing to make this

274
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,960
complicated story even
more confusing than it

275
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,560
already is?

276
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,400
Look, in its most
basic form, this is

277
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,800
what happened.

278
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,160
Argentina's economy
collapsed in 2001.

279
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,200
Their government wrote
a bunch of IOUs to

280
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,840
bondholders that it
later decided not to pay.

281
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,200
93% of those
bondholders eventually

282
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,360
accepted Argentina's
offer to pay the debt

283
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,720
back at around
30 cents on the dollar,

284
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,480
but the remaining investors--
led by a hedge fund

285
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,480
called Elliott Management--
listened to

286
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,840
Argentina's kind offer of
30 cents on the dollar

287
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,840
and counteroffered by
telling them to go

288
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,000
fuck themselves.

289
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,920
And then two years ago,
Elliott Management, who

290
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,800
at this point were acting
like an international

291
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,880
collection agency,
went full "Repo Man"

292
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,760
on Argentina.

293
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,760
A court in Ghana
today ruling that this

294
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,840
Argentine navy ship,
the "Libertad,"

295
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,520
cannot leave port.

296
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,240
Elliott Management, run
by secretive hedge fund

297
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,160
billionaire Paul Singer,
sued to take control

298
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,800
of the ship.

299
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,560
JOHN: Just--just
think about that.

300
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,240
A secretive billionaire's
hedge fund managed to

301
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,200
essentially boat-jack
a warship like a Somali

302
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,280
pirate in an Armani suit.

303
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,720
"I am the captain
of industry now.

304
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,520
I am the captain!"

305
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,600
And the hedge fund held
that ship for more than

306
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,360
two months, which is
crazy, almost as crazy as

307
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,760
how Argentina greeted
the ship upon its return.

308
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,320
NEWSMAN: She arrives to
a full-blown celebration.

309
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,840
The "ARA Libertad" is finally home after being

310
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,280
detained for two
months in Ghana.

311
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,960
The triumphant return
was watched by

312
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,840
the Argentinean president
Cristina Fernandez.

313
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,480
OK, OK.

314
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,640
First, Argentina,
what exactly do you think

315
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,800
you're doing?

316
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,920
If you're on the edge of
default, maybe cut

317
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,440
the fireworks budget a bit.

318
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,000
And also, it's a little
suspicious that you

319
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,800
suddenly care this much
about a warship which, no

320
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,360
offense, would look
more at home inside

321
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,240
a decorative
glass bottle.

322
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,360
Because, look, just to be
clear to you, Argentina

323
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,360
is by no means
blameless in this story.

324
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,600
They reneged
on their debts.

325
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,040
So throwing a party
for that boat is

326
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,760
the international equivalent
of a deadbeat dad

327
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,200
celebrating moving his car
before his ex-wife

328
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,000
could seize it
for child support.

329
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,000
"Yes! Fuck you, Carol.

330
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,760
"I need this Celica to
drive to the job I'm

331
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,040
"definitely gonna get.

332
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,520
"Yes!

333
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,800
Celica is mine!"

334
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,600
But the point is,
Is anyone else a little

335
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
uncomfortable that
a hedge fund with

336
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,200
300 employees has
the power to seize the ship

337
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,840
of a sovereign nation
of 41 million people?

338
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,920
Even the reporters
covering this whole story

339
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,560
seem a little flummoxed.

340
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,040
All sides continue
to negotiate through

341
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,440
a complex web of rulings
and conflicting

342
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,640
ideologies--what is
legal or illegal,

343
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,920
moral or immoral.

344
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,200
JOHN: OK. Well, there's one
thing I can definitely

345
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
clear up for you there.

346
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,680
Hedge funds are neither
moral nor immoral.

347
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,240
They are amoral.

348
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,520
They only exist
to make money.

349
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,360
Hedge funds look at
distressed countries

350
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,240
with assets the way
that vultures look

351
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,800
at dying zebras.

352
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,120
"Mmm!

353
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,840
"Sure it's suffering,
but this one's gonna

354
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,800
taste all stripy!"

355
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,760
Elliott Management
has been here before.

356
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,360
They reportedly made
a 400% profit

357
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,960
on Peruvian debt in
2000 and then,

358
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,480
in the Republic of Congo,
invested less than

359
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,120
$20 million and got
$90 million back.

360
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,600
Give them credit.

361
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,680
That is skilled
secondary-market investing.

362
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,760
And it also must
make great small talk

363
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,920
at parties.

364
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,480
"Hey, nice watch, Brian."

365
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,960
"Thanks! I paid for it by
shaking the Congo until

366
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,000
$90 million fell out."

367
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,840
"Oh, I thought
I liked it."

368
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,960
It is no wonder hedge funds
prefer not to have

369
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,480
their activities
scrutinized.

370
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,880
The head of Elliott Management,
Paul Singer,

371
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,120
has been called
publicity-shy,

372
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,760
and his firm's recent
letter to investors said,

373
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,000
"Obviously, our lives
would be easier if

374
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,920
"the press cared less
about this

375
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,960
particular position."

376
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,720
So is that clear
to everyone?

377
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,760
All Paul Singer wants--
this Paul Singer here--

378
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,840
is for people to respect
Paul Singer's demands

379
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,840
for Paul Singer's privacy
at this very difficult,

380
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,800
potentially profitable
time for Paul Singer, OK?

381
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,480
Respect his privacy.

382
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,320
Respect it.

383
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,160
You respect that man!

384
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,400
You respect him!

385
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,200
Perhaps the most alarming
aspect of this whole story

386
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,480
is that a brief moment
of notoriety could be

387
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,320
the worst consequence for
the hedge funds who are

388
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,800
involved in the current
situation in Argentina

389
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,920
because they've
not broken the law.

390
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,400
And the fact that that's true
makes this story so much

391
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,360
more concerning to me.

392
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,200
That a dispute with
a small group of powerful

393
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,800
investors can drive
a G-20 nation into

394
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,120
default is one of
those things that is

395
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,280
technically not illegal
but really feels like it

396
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,560
probably should be,

397
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,720
like being drunk
on a Segway

398
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,400
or watching porn
on an airplane

399
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,920
or naming your puppy
Cunty McGee.

400
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,160
You're technically
allowed to do all

401
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,760
of those things,
but isn't humanity supposed

402
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,360
to be a lot fucking
better than that?

403
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,040
And now this...

404
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,080
Stop what you're doing
and listen to this.

405
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,360
Your face wash
could kill you.

406
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,680
NEWSMAN: Too much sugar can actually kill you.

407
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,720
Binge watching TV
could kill you?

408
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,320
Your digital life
may be killing you.

409
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,760
Is your purse
killing you slowly?

410
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,520
Are your shoes
killing you?

411
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,360
Nagging spouses
can kill you.

412
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,520
Your desk job may
actually be killing you.

413
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,960
Your daytime snoozing
might be killing you.

414
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,800
Oh, boy!

415
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,360
MAN: How can my necktie
kill you?

416
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,440
And finally, finally
tonight, let's talk

417
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,680
about corporate influence
in the media.

418
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,960
And before I do,
I am very aware that we're

419
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,920
extremely lucky here on HBO.

420
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,400
We don't have advertisers,
so if I want to say

421
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
that, for instance,
Cadbury Cream Eggs

422
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,200
are filled
with dolphin sperm or that

423
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,000
Old Navy clothing makes you
look like a tacky murderer

424
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,800
or that Snickers
only satisfies you

425
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,640
for about 8 minutes,
then makes you hate

426
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,480
yourself for the rest
of the day, I can.

427
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,720
I can do all of those
things, and why?

428
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,600
Well, because of HBO's
business model, which

429
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,280
no one has been able
to adequately explain

430
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,520
to me yet.

431
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,520
But most other outlets
are locked in a constant

432
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,040
battle for editorial
independence, which is

433
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,120
especially
problematic when it comes

434
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,680
to the news.

435
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,920
America has a proud
tradition of a free

436
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,160
and independent press,
but it has always

437
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,480
been a fight.

438
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,160
Back in the fifties,
newscasters like NBC's

439
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,640
John Cameron Swayze were
introduced like this.

440
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,320
ANNOUNCER: Sit back,
light up a Camel,

441
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,320
and be an eyewitness to
the happenings that made

442
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,480
history in the last 24 hours.

443
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,600
The Camel News
Caravan presents...

444
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,600
Top story this evening--

445
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,120
Americans' life
expectancy, still 45.

446
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,640
That's Camel smooth.

447
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,600
Now, exceptions like that
aside, it's generally

448
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,760
agreed upon in journalism
that there should be

449
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
a wall separating
the editorial

450
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,960
and the business
side of news.

451
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,800
It's sometimes referred
to as the separation

452
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,920
of church and state,
although I like to think

453
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,120
of news and advertising
as the separation

454
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,960
of guacamole
and Twizzlers.

455
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,240
Separately they're good,
but if you mix them

456
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,480
together, somehow
you make both of them

457
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,160
really gross.

458
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,600
But recently,
the integrity of news has

459
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,800
become harder to protect,
particularly in print.

460
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,800
Print is still where most
original journalism is done,

461
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,800
but since papers
moved online, they have

462
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,800
struggled financially,
mainly because news is

463
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,520
like porn--people don't
want to pay for it

464
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,920
on the Internet,
even though somewhere

465
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,600
in a dimly lit room
Paul Krugman worked very hard

466
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
to make it.

467
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,920
Online--online...

468
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,920
Uh-uh. Online--
he worked hard.

469
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,880
He put his heart
and soul into that.

470
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,760
Online, print
publications have

471
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,120
struggled to attract
advertisers, partly

472
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,880
because traditional
banner ads are

473
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,200
so ineffective that one
study found we only

474
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,800
intentionally click on
them less than 2/10 of 1%

475
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,920
of the time, which
actually sounds about right

476
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,920
because did you know
that if you ever actually

477
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,040
click on a banner ad,
you literally get taken to

478
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,520
a page that reads,
"Hey, is everything OK?

479
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,360
"I'm presuming you passed
out and hit your head

480
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,640
"on the keyboard.

481
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,960
I'm calling
an ambulance right now!"

482
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,960
The publishing industry,
though, has responded to

483
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,960
this crisis by finding
a new way to appeal

484
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,520
to advertisers.

485
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,840
Native advertising is
basically saying to

486
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,920
corporations that want
to advertise,

487
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,640
"We will camouflage your
ads to make them look

488
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,000
like news stories."

489
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,640
That's essentially it.

490
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,880
"That's essentially it"?

491
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,880
Are you saying that
to sum up your point

492
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,920
on native advertising,
or are you describing

493
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,960
independent journalism?

494
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,960
"That's essentially it.

495
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,600
It's over.
We're done here."

496
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,400
Even if you've not
heard the term

497
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,920
"native advertising" before,
you have probably been

498
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,640
subjected to it by now.

499
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,960
It's when a piece of
ostensibly normal content

500
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,280
is stamped with tiny
disclaimers like this

501
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,680
and this and then contains
messages that

502
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,880
are often clear
endorsements,

503
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,200
and if you'll
excuse me,

504
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,840
I'll just take
a break from

505
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,040
making this point
by enjoying

506
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,400
the refreshing
taste of

507
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,360
Mountain Dew
Code Red.

508
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,800
Mmm.

509
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,880
And then it's at
this point that

510
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,200
you usually
realize,

511
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,200
"Oh, this isn't the thing that I
was looking for.

512
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,600
"You're just
advertising

513
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,480
the most disgusting fucking drink
ever manufactured."

514
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,960
Although--although,
I will say

515
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,480
it does undeniably
taste of red.

516
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,600
Native advertising,
though, has been

517
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,320
so lucrative for new
media organizations,

518
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,680
they've basically built
their entire business model

519
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,080
around it.

520
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,760
100% of our
revenue comes from

521
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,200
branded content.

522
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,640
So we have a lot
of partners who are

523
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,840
marketers
and major brands.

524
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,840
We work with 76 of
the top 100 brands now.

525
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,680
That's the CEO of
BuzzFeed Jonah Peretti,

526
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,040
and his face is like
BuzzFeed itself--

527
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,600
successful, appealing,
and yet somehow you want

528
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,400
to punch it.

529
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,120
BuzzFeed has created--

530
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,400
BuzzFeed has--
no, no, no.

531
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,200
BuzzFeed has created
masterpieces of

532
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,640
native advertising, such as
"10 Lifechanging Ways to Make

533
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,120
Your Day More Efficient,"
sponsored by GE,

534
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,960
and "9 Ways Cleaning
Has Become Smarter,"

535
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,080
sponsored by Swiffer,

536
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,400
and "11 Sea Creatures
Who Deserved to Die,"

537
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,040
sponsored by BP.

538
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,240
Now, that--

539
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,600
that--

540
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,120
that last one is a joke,
but it's not

541
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,800
significantly different
from the previous two.

542
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,680
Full disclosure--HBO did
pay for lists to promote

543
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,600
this show around the time
that we began, very cleverly

544
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,920
realizing, "We'd better
promote this show.

545
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,200
No one is going to give
a shit about it."

546
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,880
But the success of this
practice has clearly

547
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,800
impressed old media such
as Time Inc., whose CEO

548
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,800
recently created
a native advertising team,

549
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,600
and he also doesn't see why
that might be an issue.

550
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,400
JOE RIPP: As long as it's
clearly marked, as long

551
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,560
as the consumer knows
the difference between what's

552
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,560
editorial and what's
native, I don't see any

553
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,560
problem with it at all.

554
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,920
Yeah, but it is
a problem, though,

555
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,280
because the consumer
cannot tell

556
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,720
the difference.

557
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,080
A recent study showed
that less than half

558
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,240
of visitors to a news site
could distinguish

559
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,320
native advertising
from actual news.

560
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,600
And, of course, they can't
because it's supposed

561
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
to blend in.

562
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,280
You're like a camouflage
manufacturer saying,

563
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,680
"Only an idiot could
not tell the difference

564
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,680
"between that man
and foliage.

565
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,280
"I mean, look,
the camouflage clearly states

566
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,640
"not foliage
on the collar.

567
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,800
"It's clear, and besides,
I'm sure the deer knows

568
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,520
"the difference
between the two things.

569
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,800
"Deers are so smart.

570
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,200
You have to
respect deer."

571
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,680
And if you are wondering
how he reconciles this

572
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,440
with the line between
church and state,

573
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,840
well, funny story.

574
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,680
Quite frankly, I've
changed church and state,

575
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,800
as you know.

576
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,720
We took that away, and we
said the editors are gonna

577
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,720
now be working
for the business side

578
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,960
of the equation.

579
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,400
Quite frankly, I think
they're happier, they're

580
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,360
more excited about it because
no longer are we asking

581
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,200
ourselves the question,
"Are we violating

582
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,520
church and state?"
Whatever that was.

583
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,240
"Whatever that was"?

584
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,280
That's like a surgeon
saying, "Hey, I found

585
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,960
"this squishy thing
in there, all bloody

586
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,040
and gross, so I removed
it, whatever that was!"

587
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,920
That was the heart!

588
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,840
That was what made
the whole thing work!

589
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,600
You needed that!

590
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,240
And it's not just
Time Inc. that's doing this.

591
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,920
"The Atlantic" published
some native advertising

592
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,880
for the Church
of Scientology.

593
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,120
The ad is the kind
you've probably seen.

594
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,320
It's called sponsored
content, and it's

595
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,160
formatted to look like
an actual article on their

596
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,600
web site, and the article
lavishly praised

597
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,920
Scientology's leader,
David Miscavige.

598
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,800
JOHN: OK. Now for
"The Atlantic," that is

599
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,840
ethically compromising,
but for Scientology, that

600
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,800
is just plain stupid.

601
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,840
They clearly should've
gone with a magazine

602
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,960
with better access to
their key demographic,

603
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,880
such as "Depressed
Aspiring Actor Monthly."

604
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,080
But even--even
the "New York Times" is now

605
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,440
embracing this.

606
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,520
They had a recent
feature on their web site

607
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,880
about women in prison,
which looked like

608
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,960
a serious piece of
journalism but was

609
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,840
actually a paid post
promoting season two

610
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,760
of "Orange is the New Black."

611
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,760
And here's the thing--as
far as native advertising

612
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,440
goes, that's about
as good as it gets.

613
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,400
The reporting is real,
and the sponsored

614
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,320
branding was minimal,
but it is still an ad.

615
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,960
It's like hearing
the one Katy Perry song

616
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,080
that you like.

617
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,000
You think, "Sure, this
is the best possible

618
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,320
"iteration of Katy Perry,
but it still feels wrong

619
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,760
to be listening to this."

620
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,000
You're gonna
hear me roar

621
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,360
Louder, louder
than a lion

622
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,680
It's a good song.

623
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,960
It's a good song.

624
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,840
There's a 12-year-old
girl inside me who is

625
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,960
empowered by that song.

626
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,200
The problem is--
the problem is--the problem

627
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,120
is sponsors aren't always
going to be as benign as

628
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,880
"Orange is
the New Black."

629
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,880
Sometimes, it's going
to be a company like

630
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,840
Chevron, who recently
sponsored a piece

631
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,760
in the "Times" about
"How Our Energy Needs

632
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,920
Are Changing."

633
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,800
And, spoiler alert,
the notion that they're

634
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,800
changing because we
fucked up the Earth

635
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,200
thanks to companies
like Chevron is not

636
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,680
the conclusion of
the article.

637
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,640
You might think all of
this might seriously

638
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,600
damage trust
in a news organization,

639
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,920
but a "Times" advertising
executive would like to

640
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,920
vigorously refute that.

641
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,880
Let me start by
vigorously refuting

642
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,880
the notion that native
advertising has to erode

643
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,440
consumer trust or
compromise the wall that

644
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,680
exists between editorial
and advertising.

645
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,800
Good native advertising
is just not meant to

646
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,960
be trickery.

647
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,920
It's meant to be
a publisher sharing

648
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,040
its storytelling tools
with a marketer.

649
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,040
Exactly, exactly!

650
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,480
It's not trickery.

651
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,440
It's sharing
storytelling tools,

652
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,920
and that's not bullshit.

653
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,600
It's repurposed
bovine waste.

654
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,400
And, look, in news--

655
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,760
in news, that is
seemingly the model now.

656
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,960
Ads are baked into
content like chocolate chips

657
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,200
into a cookie,
except it's actually more

658
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,520
like raisins into
a cookie because no one

659
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,360
fucking wants them there.

660
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,800
And the point is, think
how much it would affect

661
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,520
your trust in me as
a source if you knew that

662
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,000
that last anti-raisin-cookie
joke was actually brought

663
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,200
to you by Chips Ahoy!

664
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,400
But before we demonize
these organizations

665
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,720
for selling out, it is
worth remembering this is

666
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,000
all at least
partially our fault.

667
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,360
A press cannot be free
and independent if nobody

668
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,200
is willing to pay for
it, and it seems nobody

669
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,520
is going to.

670
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,200
In which case, I'd like
to make a suggestion.

671
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,720
If our news is going to
be corrupted, we should

672
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,880
at least get
something in return.

673
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,280
Every time a corporation
sneaks advertising into

674
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,440
our news and ruins it, our news should be

675
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:07,160
allowed to sneak into
their advertising.

676
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,200
ANNOUNCER: When you get
hot, you get thirsty,

677
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,000
and when you get
thirsty, there's only

678
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,520
one choice...

679
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,040
Diet Coke.

680
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,600
The recent Ebola outbreak
has killed over 700

681
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,200
people in West Africa.

682
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,120
The World Health
Organization says they

683
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,360
don't yet have it under
control and the situation

684
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,880
threatens to
become catastrophic.

685
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,960
ANNOUNCER: Diet Coke.

686
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,280
It's only fair.

687
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,560
That's it for our
show this week.

688
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,640
See you next week!

689
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:52,560
Thanks for joining us.
Good night!
