00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,480
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,920
Episode 6

3
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,120
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
My name is John Oliver.

4
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,160
Thank you so much,
thank you for being with us.

5
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,520
Let's have a quick recap of the week.

6
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,760
To be honest, this week
has been a huge disappointment.

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,640
All week long
we were promised a fairy tale.

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,520
California Chrome
will try to become

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,120
the 12th horse
to ever win the Triple Crown.

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,680
Can California Chrome do it ?

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,280
God speed
and speed to that great horse.

12
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:09,920
God speed, California Chrome !
Run like a horse !

13
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,280
I mean as fast as you can until that
tiny man balancing on your back

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,080
stops hitting you with a stick.

15
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,600
But sadly,
it was not meant to be.

16
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,360
California Chrome
lost some of its shine

17
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,600
at the Belmont stakes when Tonalist
crossed the finish line to win.

18
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,080
Who the fuck is Tonalist ?!

19
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,080
That's not the horse I wanted.
I wanted a different horse !

20
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,440
Fuck this horse.
If that horse is Tonalist !

21
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,960
It's hard to tell, they're all horses
but fuck that horse.

22
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,720
All was not lost. While yesterday
didn't give us a Triple Crown Winner,

23
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,240
it did give us in California Chrome's
co-owner Steve Coburn,

24
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,800
the secretariat of sore losers:

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,480
If you can't make enough points
to get into the Kentucky Derby,

26
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,720
you can't run in the other two races
and it's all or nothing.

27
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,280
This is not fair to these horses.

28
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,680
Exactly, we need to treat
these horses fairly.

29
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,280
By breeding them until they have
structural integrity of a Jenga tower

30
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,680
and then when they collapse,
shooting them in the head.

31
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,720
Well done, Coburn.

32
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,840
Because it is not easy to be
the least classy person at a racetrack.

33
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,760
Let's cut him a break.
It was the heat of the moment.

34
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,040
Let's see what he said this morning
once he had a chance to sleep it off.

35
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,680
You figure it out,
and I mean... Ask yourself,

36
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,120
would it be fair if I played basketball
with a child in a wheelchair ?

37
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,080
I guess that depends, how good
is the child's outside shot

38
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,080
and are you as bad at basketball
as you are at analogies ?

39
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,320
In other absurd competitions,
there was an amazing moment

40
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,800
on the German version of
"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire."

41
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,160
The full title in German is
"Who Dares Have The Hubris"

42
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,080
"To Assume They Deserve Great
Wealth For Mere Excellence In Trivia ?"

43
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,640
Beautiful language.

44
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,520
It happened when the contestant,
Wolfgang Bosbach,

45
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,800
just like honey off the tongue,

46
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,880
it happened when he decided
to use his lifeline

47
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,320
to call German chancellor
Angela Merkel:

48
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,000
A German lawmaker tried Merkel
for his phone a friend lifeline.

49
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,520
Who should I call now
except the chancellor ?

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,160
I don't know if she's busy.

51
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,000
Let me answer that for you.
She is. She is busy.

52
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,640
She's not in a meeting with
a Greek finance minister saying:

53
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,480
"You mind if I leave my phone on ?
You know the phone a friend option ?"

54
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,720
"I'm the friend !"

55
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,360
"For any questions regarding
the I.M.F. or Doctor Who is me."

56
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,720
Please tell me she did not
answer that phone.

57
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:17,440
When the show called her,
they got her voicemail twice.

58
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,480
Good. The only thing worse
than her answering would be

59
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,440
if she'd answered it saying:
"Hello ! It's Angela."

60
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,920
"Can't hear you ! It's loud in club !
I'm so wasted right now !"

61
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,240
Speaking of Germans
losing things,

62
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,080
it was the 70th anniversary
of D-Day this week.

63
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,040
One of... Okay.

64
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,600
It was one of two
major anniversaries,

65
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,800
the other being the 25th anniversary
of the protests in Tiananmen Square.

66
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,600
Not that you would know that
if you lived in China.

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,960
China's done their best to erase
the massacre from history books.

68
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,280
Search "Tiananmen Square" on
China's monitored internet

69
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,320
and the results are censored.

70
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,440
25 years have passed and we still
don't know what happened.

71
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,360
That's not cool, I think.

72
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,760
- Not cool ?
- Yeah.

73
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,480
Not cool ? Wearing socks
and sandals is "not cool".

74
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,240
Ordering fries "for the table"
and eating them all that's not cool.

75
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,920
Erasing a massacre is chilling.

76
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,480
Protesters tried
to subvert the Government

77
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,960
using phrases like "May the 35th"
instead of June the Fourth.

78
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,000
That caused authorities
to clamp down even harder.

79
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,240
The list of banned words
gets longer and longer,

80
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,680
so this year, words that were
banned like "today", "this day",

81
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,440
"sensitive day," even the phrase
"when spring turns to summer".

82
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,560
No ! You can't ban
"when spring turns to summer !"

83
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,360
I need access to the Chinese market
if my novel is going to succeed !

84
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,240
No one wants that,
nobody wants that.

85
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,480
The most ingenious attempt
at subversion was this:

86
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,360
when a Chinese soap opera
actress's supposed sex video leaked,

87
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,000
an activist group edited the video
to add in messages

88
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,240
encouraging people to show up
at Tiananmen Square.

89
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,920
That is brilliant. Can you even
imagine how smart we would be

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,680
if we snuck information
into our pornography ?

91
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,520
"I want you so bad."
Actually, it's badly.

92
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,400
That's just one of six grammar
rules that I'm anxious to cover

93
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,240
during this fornication.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,480
Pornography is illegal in China,
so the government took it down.

95
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,440
What we need to sneak
the message out there

96
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,440
would be something both legal
and popular among China's youth.

97
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,280
"Friends" lives on in the heart
of the Chinese capital,

98
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,360
where a "Central Perk" replica
is being built by Du Xin.

99
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,280
We want to be like one
of the characters in the show.

100
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,080
It's about caring between friends.

101
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,680
I'm crazy about Friends.

102
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,920
China is, for some reason,
obsessed with "Friends".

103
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,120
Did you know
that the Chinese character

104
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,120
for "Obsession with friends" is
the same as the one for "opportunity" ?

105
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,680
This might help young people
in China remember Tiananmen Square:

106
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,600
- Gentlemen, pick your category.
- Fears and pet-peeves.

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,960
What is Monica's biggest
pet-peeve ?

108
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,880
- The government killing people.
- Correct.

109
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,360
- Ladies ?
- Same category.

110
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,480
According to Chandler,

111
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,720
how many died in the 1989
Tiananmen Square protests ?

112
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,080
Anywhere from 200
to 2600 !

113
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,440
That is correct.

114
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,000
Why'd they kill those guys ?

115
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,400
They wanted free speech
and government accountability.

116
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,840
Hang in there, China.
"We'll be there for you".

117
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,400
I would like to talk to you
about the sausage principle.

118
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,160
The theory that says,

119
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,160
if you love something,
never find out how it was made.

120
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,280
Tonight, I would like
to show you my sausage.

121
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,240
Wait !
This is my sausage.

122
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,160
The 2014 FIFA World Cup.

123
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,560
My god, okay, the World Cup
starts this week

124
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,040
and I am both excited
and conflicted about it.

125
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,600
In America, soccer is something you
pick your daughter up from.

126
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,840
But for me, and everyone else
on earth, it's a little more important.

127
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,080
Soccer had become
Brazil's religion.

128
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,480
In Columbia, soccer was a religion.

129
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,520
Football is a religion here.

130
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,040
Soccer or football,
like we say, it's a religion.

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,080
They're not exaggerating. When
David Beckham got a tattoo of Jesus,

132
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,360
the response
of most soccer fans was:

133
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,120
"That's huge for Jesus.
That's a big deal for him."

134
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,720
Here's my conflict, the World Cup
is one of my favorite things.

135
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,120
But it's organized by these guys.
FIFA. You either know it

136
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,640
as "The Federation Internationale
de Football Association"

137
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,040
or that soccer video game
you have.

138
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,840
But for American viewers who
may never have encountered them,

139
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,560
FIFA is a comically
grotesque organization.

140
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,720
Telling someone about the inner
workings of FIFA for the first time

141
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,520
is a bit like showing someone
"two girls one cup."

142
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,320
You do it so you can watch the
horrified expressions on faces.

143
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,800
Let's start where FIFA's current
world cup will take place: Brazil.

144
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Brazilians are excited
about everything.

145
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,800
This is how they celebrate the fact
that it's just about to be Lent !

146
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,240
They love the concept of giving
up chocolate temporarily.

147
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,600
They're the biggest
soccer fans on earth.

148
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,120
They must be thrilled at the prospect
of hosting the World Cup.

149
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,400
There has been months of unrest
in some of the city's favilas

150
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,120
with clashes between
police and residents.

151
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,080
People demonstrated against
Brazil holding the World Cup.

152
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,160
That makes no sense.
Why would you be unhappy

153
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,120
hosting the thing you love
the most in all the world ?

154
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,960
The government spent $11 billion
getting ready.

155
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,080
The US team will play its second
game here in the city of Manaus,

156
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,080
in this brand new,
270 million dollar stadium.

157
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,440
Manaus is so remote, it's almost
impossible to reach by car,

158
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,920
which is why officials had to have
materials brought in by boat,

159
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,840
shipped across from Portugal
and up the Amazon River.

160
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,880
Okay that does seem
like a waste of money.

161
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,160
That stadium is only going to be
used for four World Cup games.

162
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,720
There's also no team in Manaus
that can fill it afterwards,

163
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,640
it becomes the world's
most expensive bird toilet.

164
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,880
No wonder
Brazilians are so upset,

165
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,440
when you think about what
they're getting in return.

166
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,240
They're going to make money
as well as the money they're spending.

167
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,440
FIFA makes the money,
this is where the controversy is.

168
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,320
The country doesn't make money.
FIFA is who makes the money.

169
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Brazil, let me put this in terms
you might understand:

170
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,520
think of money as pubic hair
and FIFA as wax.

171
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,520
They're going to be all over you
during the World Cup.

172
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,520
When they go, they're taking
all the money with them.

173
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,200
Including some from places you
didn't know you had money.

174
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,520
Leaving you teary eyed going
"Jesus, what happened here ?"

175
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,440
"I'm never doing this again."

176
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,840
Here are FIFA's tax demands
for prospective host countries:

177
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,880
It is FIFA and it's FIFA's
subsidiaries that are fully exempt

178
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,320
from any tax whatsoever
levied at whatever level.

179
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,600
Consumption taxes, income taxes,
it's all exempt.

180
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,560
That's right.
By the Brazil's own estimates,

181
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,600
they're allowing FIFA to
forego $250 million in taxes.

182
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,160
Somewhere,
Wesley Snipes is going:

183
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,480
"So soccer was the answer...
It seems so obvious now."

184
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,040
FIFA says they leave a lot behind.
Which they do, like new laws.

185
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,360
Once upon a time, Brazil did this:

186
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,840
In 2003, the Brazilian government
banned alcohol from stadiums

187
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,920
because of the high
death rate amongst fans.

188
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,120
That seems like a good idea.
Potentially life-saving, even.

189
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,240
Budweiser is one
of FIFA's key sponsors.

190
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,040
They sell a product they reflexively
insist on calling "beer".

191
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,840
FIFA seemed anxious
to protect Budweiser

192
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,360
from a law designed
to protect people.

193
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,400
FIFA's secretary general went
to Brazil with a simple message.

194
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,400
I'm sorry to say
and maybe I look arrogant,

195
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,160
but that's something
we are not negotiating.

196
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,960
There will be and there
must be a spot of the law,

197
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,920
the fact that we have
the right to sell beer.

198
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,880
If maybe I look a bit arrogant,
but how you say it ?

199
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,480
Fuck your laws
and your public safety.

200
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,800
And the amazing thing is here:
FIFA won.

201
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,560
They pressured Brazil into passing
"Budweiser bill",

202
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,680
allowing beer sales
in soccer stadiums.

203
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,840
You can either be horrified
by that or relieved

204
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,200
that FIFA wasn't also sponsored
by cocaine and chainsaws.

205
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,640
Brazil's lucky at least they just
had FIFA force alcohol on them.

206
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,520
When South Africa hosted
the World Cup,

207
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,000
FIFA forced the creation of
"the FIFA World Cup Courts".

208
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,640
It's like going to the World Series
and being dragged

209
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,760
in front
of judge Philly Phanatic.

210
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,920
Except FIFA's courts
were no joke.

211
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,920
Two Zimbabweans who robbed
foreign journalists on a Wednesday

212
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,960
were arrested on a Thursday
and began 15 year jail sentences.

213
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,200
Unsettlingly fast. That's like
when you order Chinese food

214
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,160
and it comes five minutes later.

215
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,560
Thanks very much
but that was too quick.

216
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,200
You didn't have time
to make this properly.

217
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:56,040
There is an irony in FIFA setting up
"any" kind of justice system,

218
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,040
given the scandals
that have dogged it.

219
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,640
FIFA tried to tackle
its shady inner workings

220
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,120
by suspending two executives
on corruption charges.

221
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,920
The FIFA scandal rumbles on,
Jack Warner resigned as vice president.

222
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,920
Many corruption
scandals FIFA had to deal with.

223
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,320
Bribery and FIFA go together
like peanut butter and jelly.

224
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,400
They shouldn't, peanut butter and
jelly are "supposed" to go together.

225
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,640
FIFA and bribery
should go together

226
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,840
like peanut butter and a child
with a deadly nut allergy.

227
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,960
No, Devin, no !
It's for your brother !

228
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,360
If you think FIFA can't get
any more cartoonishly evil,

229
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,000
this is their headquarters'
"actual" boardroom.

230
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,440
FIFA modeled where they meet on
the war room from "Dr. Strangelove".

231
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:56,720
"Exhibit A" for "an organization that
does not give a shit what you think."

232
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:03,160
The head of FIFA maintains that
they are a non-profit organization.

233
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,600
We are a non-profit organization
and we have to remain one.

234
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,720
A non-profit with over
a billion dollars in the bank.

235
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,120
Yes, but this is a reserve !

236
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:20,920
A reserve of a billion dollars.
When your rainy day fund is so big,

237
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,720
you've got to check it
for swimming cartoon ducks,

238
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,320
you might not be
a non-profit anymore.

239
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:34,440
The man you just saw
is Sepp Blatter

240
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,040
and even his name
should have been a red flag.

241
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,600
If your name is Sepp,
at the bare minimum,

242
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,160
you've strangled someone
in a bar fight, that's just a fact.

243
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,960
Let me give you a taste
of Sepp Blatter as a human being:

244
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,400
He was asked how should women's
soccer be made more popular.

245
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,040
He said
they should wear shorter shorts.

246
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Great idea. Put the ladies
in hot pants. Call it foxy soccer.

247
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,720
Tighten up the jerseys. Replace
the ball with a plate of hot wings.

248
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,880
Fuck it, let's just open a Hooters.

249
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,680
FIFA, the humble nonprofit,

250
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,880
recently spent $27 million
to fund "United Passions",

251
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,800
a fictionalized version
of their history

252
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,520
starring, for some reason,
Tim Roth as Sepp Blatter.

253
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,880
And this movie,
like FIFA, itself looks terrible.

254
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,840
We'll be the Federation International
de Football Association. FIFA.

255
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,240
The first world cup
will be held in Uruguay.

256
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,120
You have everything
you need to run our family.

257
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,880
But you know,
the slightest error and you're out.

258
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,200
Who makes a sports film where
the heroes are the executives ?

259
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,440
You don't need 2 hours
and Tim Roth

260
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,800
because the greatest film
about Sepp Blatter has been made.

261
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,680
It's ten seconds long
and it's on YouTube.

262
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,120
That is wonderful.
That is the one time you can say:

263
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,480
"I'm glad that old man
fell off that stage."

264
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,560
Perhaps the worst part of FIFA
is not its past or its present.

265
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,200
It's its future. Because the host of
the 2022 World Cup has been decided.

266
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,120
The winner to organize

267
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,240
the 2022 FIFA World Cup is Qatar !

268
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,680
Qatar ?! There's between
one and 50 reasons

269
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,440
why that is an awful idea.

270
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,920
Summer temperatures in Qatar
can reach some 50 degrees Celsius.

271
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,680
A difficult environment to hold
a sporting event outdoors.

272
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,840
50 degrees Celsius
is 122 degrees Fahrenheit.

273
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,120
You are hosting the World Cup

274
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,200
somewhere where soccer
can not physically be played.

275
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,560
That's like if the NFL chose
to host the Super Bowl in a lake.

276
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,000
There are allegations that FIFA
executives took bribes

277
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,160
to put the World Cup in Qatar,
I hope that's true.

278
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,280
Otherwise, it makes no sense.

279
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,000
Not just because of the weather,
but because of the working conditions.

280
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,400
Qatar is a slave state
in the 21st century.

281
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,920
A migrant worker can't leave
without an exit visa,

282
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,440
that visa has to be approved
by his employer.

283
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,320
- Who has your passport ?
- It's in the Main Office.

284
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,880
- So you're trapped here ?
- Yes.

285
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,720
Coffins coming home every day,
more than a worker per day is dying.

286
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:56,200
From the figures of just
two countries, India and Nepal,

287
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:03,360
more than 4 000 workers will die
before a ball is kicked off in 2022.

288
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,200
So the Qatar World Cup
is shaping up to be

289
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,920
the most deadly Middle East
construction project since this one.

290
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,080
I hope I've proven to you
that FIFA is just appalling.

291
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,600
And yet,
and here's their power,

292
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,720
I am still so excited about
the World Cup next week.

293
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,920
It's hard to justify
how I can get so much joy

294
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,640
from an organization
that caused so much pain.

295
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,480
Other than going back
to right where we started:

296
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,920
Soccer or football, like we say,
it's a religion.

297
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,880
It's an organized religion.
And FIFA is its church.

298
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,640
Its leader is infallible,
it compels South American countries

299
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,880
to spend money don't have
building opulent cathedrals

300
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,720
and it may be responsible for
the deaths in the Middle East.

301
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,520
But for millions of people
around the world, like me,

302
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,920
it is also the guardian of the only
thing that gives lives any meaning.

303
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,720
If that comparison doesn't make
Americans love soccer

304
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,640
then frankly nothing will.

305
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,440
And now this:

306
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,200
Chris Matthews reminds everyone
who he used to work for.

307
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,040
I worked in the business of politics
when you had Tip O'Neill, my boss.

308
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,200
I worked for Tip O'Neill.
My great boss O'Neill. Tip O'Neill.

309
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,800
I got to know it because
I was Tip's guy.

310
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,600
My old boss Tip O'Neill
loves the "Golden Girls".

311
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,960
And finally tonight,
a lighter subject, Syria.

312
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,440
For three years now,

313
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,200
Bashar al-Assad has been brutally
clamping down on his own people.

314
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,880
Killing more than 100 000 people
and displacing millions.

315
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,600
And yet Assad is still there.

316
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
He's like herpes or
a Prairie Home Companion.

317
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,280
At this point, he's clearly
never fucking going away.

318
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,600
This week, in the midst
of this bloodbath,

319
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,800
he had the bare-faced-balls
to stage an election.

320
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,600
Guess how that turned out.

321
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,880
President Bashar al-Assad allegedly
won nearly 89 percent of the votes.

322
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,520
89 percent ?
That is too high.

323
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,840
All dictators should know:
a rigged election should be

324
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,080
like a pleasant spring day,
high sixties, low seventies.

325
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:42,160
Al-Assad is a maniac and nothing
we can do is going to stop him.

326
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,920
We tried taking away his chemical
weapons. Guess what happened ?

327
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,720
The Syrian regime
may have found a loophole.

328
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,040
Chlorine gas, which can be used
legitimately in water treatment,

329
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,640
has also allegedly been used
in government bombing attacks.

330
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,400
The poison gas burns the lungs
and can be deadly.

331
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,680
We're not going to do
anything about that.

332
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,600
The opposition are made up
of "1 000 distinct armed units",

333
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,440
and any regime change is likely
to be followed by ethnic cleansing.

334
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,920
You're thinking "it's the Middle East,
everything will be fine. It always is."

335
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,080
This time, I'm not so sure.
Basically: we are stuck.

336
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,000
Syria is at the mercy of this guy.

337
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,400
If we're forced to live
in a perpetual nightmare,

338
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,440
let's learn something about
the man who put us there.

339
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,040
What's this
super-villain's backstory ?

340
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,120
Growing up he was a polite boy

341
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,800
who never lorded
his status over his friends.

342
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,640
Assad ended up studying
ophthalmology in London

343
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,920
and was known for his love
of volleyball and rock music

344
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,520
than for his interest in politics.

345
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,680
Okay, that's a surprise. A volleyball,
music loving ophthalmologist

346
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,880
was not the back story
I was expecting.

347
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,880
When you look at his face it does
actually makes sense.

348
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,920
He could not look more like
an ophthalmologist than that.

349
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:09,400
Why didn't he follow his incredibly
boring dream and do that ?

350
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,320
Because he should be treating
an 8-year-old's case of pink-eye now.

351
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,880
That actually could have happened,
if it wasn't for a cruel twist of fate.

352
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,400
In 1994,  Assad was suddenly
called back to Syria

353
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,480
after his older brother
was killed in a car accident.

354
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,040
He was now
next in line to rule.

355
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,960
So he was second choice
behind his older brother.

356
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,240
We're just lucky to have avoided
the third Assad brother, Dustin,

357
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,040
a screw-up he forgot to wish
Aunt Linda a happy birthday.

358
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,680
Fuck you, Dustin,
she only turns 75 once.

359
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,360
I'm not a psychologist but I would
say that Assad has family issues.

360
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,640
The strong figure in this family,
after the death of Hafez Assad,

361
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,080
was Aniseh, the mother of Bashar
and she was known to urge Bashar

362
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,360
to crack down even harder,
to live up to the legacy of his father.

363
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,240
- She is pressuring him ?
- Yes.

364
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,480
Perfect. So now we've got
a brutal dictator with mommy issues.

365
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,960
Next thing we'll hear about
is about his bed-wetting problem.

366
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,520
And the fact that he won't go
anywhere without his woobie.

367
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,920
The more you learn about Assad,
more you come to terms with the fact

368
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,080
that he's half mass-murderer
and half your creepy roommate.

369
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,360
Two years ago,
a trove of his emails leaked,

370
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,000
and the world had a glimpse
into his music tastes.

371
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,360
As the people of Syria have been
fighting and dying for their freedom,

372
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,640
their president Bashir al Assad has
been ordering pop music off of iTunes.

373
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,040
His playlist includes
"Sexy and I Know it" by LMFAO.

374
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,640
LMFAO ? We're dealing with someone

375
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,720
with the political instincts
of a young Joseph Stalin

376
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,040
and music tastes of a 14-year-old
girl from Orange County named Tiffany.

377
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,160
That song is so hot right now.

378
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,200
Among Assad's other purchases were
a song from "Right Said Fred",

379
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,520
the British sensation
you might remember from this:

380
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,800
That is a great song, by the way.

381
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,280
But it shouldn't be
on a dictator's playlist.

382
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,760
A dictator's power
is in their mystique.

383
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,600
When you picture Assad,
he wants you to hear this:

384
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,960
Now when you look at him
all you should be able to hear is this:

385
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:50,080
And that's the point:
he's a monster, but he's also a moron.

386
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,640
It's frustrating that we're powerless
to do anything to hurt him.

387
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,520
If only there were something,
however small, we could do.

388
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,280
We could find something
he loves and turn it against him.

389
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,800
We could track down,
let's say, Right Said Fred.

390
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,400
And we could, hypothetically,
fly them here from London

391
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,120
to perform a rewritten anti-Assad
version of their greatest hit.

392
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:19,360
Would it really be worth,
for the momentary catharsis

393
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,600
of mildly irritating one of
the worst people on the planet ?

394
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,520
Ladies and gentleman,
may I present to you,

395
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,640
one of Bashar al Assad's favorite
bands, Right Said Fred !

396
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:48,040
You're too awful for this earth.
Too awful for this earth.

397
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,320
So awful it hurts.

398
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,880
Your face has barely got a chin.
It's barely got a chin.

399
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,320
You look just like him...

400
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,880
So please,
stop downloading our tracks.

401
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,920
Here's your money back.

402
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,480
You're a monster.
We hate your regime.

403
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,160
And we think you should be
tried for war crimes.

404
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,240
Yeah, for war crimes, yeah.

405
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,840
You should probably
be on trial for war crimes.

406
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,480
You're an ophthalmologist.
Can you read this ?

407
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,360
You are just a walking taint.
The opposite of a saint.

408
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,400
At least Hitler could paint.

409
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,880
You're a monster.
And a volleyball fan.

410
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,360
But more than that,
you're an asshole.

411
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,840
Who's afraid of his mom.

412
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,080
You're a murderous
mom-fearing asshole.

413
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,480
You're an asshole !
You're an asshole, yeah !

414
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,000
Everyone thinks you're an asshole !
All together now !

415
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,360
You're an asshole !
You're an asshole, yeah !

416
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,600
Everyone thinks you're an asshole !

417
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,240
Here we go !

418
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,360
Please stop listening to our songs.

419
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,280
Yes ! That's our show, goodnight.

420
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,200
That's our show,
thanks to Right Said Fred,

421
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,160
have a great week.

422
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,440
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

423
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,040
END OF EPISODE 6
