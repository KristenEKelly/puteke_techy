1
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,920
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight." I'm John Oliver.

2
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,960
Thank you for being with us.

3
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,680
Just time for a quick recap of the week.

4
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,040
And first, first let us deal here

5
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,800
with the elephant in the room.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,680
Last week, we made a unicorn-themed appeal

7
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,360
to Scotland not to leave the U.K.

8
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,600
On Thursday, this happened.

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,200
Voters in Scotland have rejected independence

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,520
and have chosen to remain a part of the United Kingdom.

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,320
The kingdom is saved!

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,400
The kingdom is saved!

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,960
And it is--it is not often
you get to say that

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,000
outside of a live action
role play setting.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,320
"The kingdom is secure.
I've secured the kingdom."

16
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,120
One of the incredible things
about the Scottish referendum

17
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,040
was not how people voted,
but how many people voted.

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,920
WOMAN: On Thursday,
voters turned out

19
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,200
in their biggest numbers in
Scottish electoral history.

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,720
Some incredible turnout figures,
let me tell you.

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,400
Stirling, 90%.

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,000
Never seen anything like it.

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,480
East Renfrewshire

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,840
I think is actually even higher.

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,680
Is it 90.5%?

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,800
It just can't--it can't be.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,800
I had no idea the Scots
were even physically capable

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,600
of making a mark
on a piece of paper.

29
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,000
No idea.

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,240
88% voted in Clackmannanshire?

31
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,480
There is no way Clackmannanshire
is not a made-up place.

32
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,240
They're lying to us.
They're lying to us.

33
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,920
If you watched
the returns on Thursday,

34
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,920
there was one amazing detail.

35
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,200
For some reason, each council
read not just the totals

36
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,920
of yes and no votes,

37
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,560
but also the reasons why
some votes were not counted.

38
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,600
The reasons for rejection
are as follows.

39
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,840
Want of an official mark, zero.

40
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,200
Voting in favor of
both answers, 13.

41
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,360
4 for writing a mark by which
the voter could be identified.

42
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,560
Also one vote saying the person
reading this is an ass waffle.

43
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,320
One vote reading, "Cathy, I
love you, please take me back.

44
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,080
It's Mark."

45
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,000
14 drawings of a unicorn having
sex with another unicorn.

46
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,080
And 11,000 votes for Deez Nuts.

47
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,840
So, the winner is Deez Nuts.
Democracy doesn't work.

48
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,960
It doesn't work.

49
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,760
Moving on.

50
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,840
Moving on, there was also voting
this week in New Zealand.

51
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,560
Now, you may know it as
the homeland of Lorde,

52
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,400
or that place where people
who are happier than you

53
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,800
go on vacation.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,160
Now, on Saturday,
they re-elected

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,800
their prime minister John Key,
despite a turbulent campaign,

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
with a major scandal
that engulfed him

57
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,600
earlier this week.

58
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,880
Rap superstar Eminem's
become the latest

59
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,880
to take potshots
at our government.

60
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,160
Why is Eminem getting involved?

61
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,800
Is he concerned
about the South Island's

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,080
rising wallaby population?

63
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,600
If so, good for you, Eminem.

64
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,480
Those things are
giant rats with pouches.

65
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,720
They must be stopped.

66
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,880
Unless something else
was bothering him.

67
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,080
WOMAN: It's all over
this campaign ad.

68
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,480
MAN: ...and the National Party's
economic management.

69
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,120
New Zealand is heading
in the right direction.

70
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,000
WOMAN: But what's wrong with it,
say Eminem's publishers,

71
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,960
is that the Nats didn't ask
if they could use the song.

72
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,200
That's right.
The ruling party of New Zealand

73
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,800
was accused of
ripping off...

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,480
Eminem.

75
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,800
And I can't imagine
how angry that must have made

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,080
Eminem.

77
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,400
I'd go so far as to say

78
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,640
that New Zealand has made an...

79
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,160
enemy of Eminem.

80
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,640
But perhaps--perhaps the reason

81
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,560
it didn't affect the outcome
of the election

82
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,080
is that the party's
campaign manager

83
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,920
had this brilliant
legal defense.

84
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,600
WOMAN: What's your understanding of
the legality

85
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,120
of your
campaign song?

86
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,880
Oh, we think
it's pretty legal.

87
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,800
I think these guys
are just having a crack

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,040
and a bit of a eye
for the main chance

89
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,440
because it's
an election campaign.

90
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,240
"Pretty legal."

91
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,200
That is not
a concept that exists.

92
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,160
That's like being sort of dead.

93
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,400
I want to see that man
as a defense lawyer.

94
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,240
"Your honor, my client pleads
probably not, yeah?

95
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,360
Probably not.
Just having a crack."

96
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,640
And--and finally this week,
it was another

97
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,800
terrible 7 days for the NFL

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,760
with yet more news regarding
serious domestic abuse.

99
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,920
Everyone had
significant questions

100
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,680
for NFL Commissioner
Roger Goodell

101
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,040
regarding how the NFL
handles domestic abuse,

102
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,600
and what specific plans he has
to improve things in the future.

103
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,800
And so on Friday, he spent
an entire 45 minutes

104
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,640
answering none of them.

105
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,080
These incidents demonstrate
that we can use the NFL

106
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,200
to help create change.

107
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,560
We are taking a number of steps.

108
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,280
We will re-examine,
enhance, and improve

109
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,000
all of our current programs,
and then we'll do more.

110
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,000
There will be changes to our
personal conduct policy.

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,800
I know this because
we will make it happen.

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We've acknowledged that we
need to change what we're doing.

113
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,800
Now we have to get to what are
those changes going to be.

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,200
JOHN: "And in so saying, I have
effectively made sounds

115
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,440
"which, when put together,
constitute words

116
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,000
"which can then be
turned into sentences

117
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,800
"that make noise to travel into
your ears and that's 45 minutes.

118
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,360
"I've done it!
Goodell out!

119
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,520
"Clear eyes, full hearts.
Can't take my job. Fuck you!

120
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,680
Fuck you!"

121
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,840
The--the low point of the press
conference might have been

122
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,800
when Goodell had this exchange
with a reporter from "TMZ."

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,360
I would have loved
to have seen that tape.

124
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,160
Should we do more to get that
information in the future?

125
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,640
That's a question I want
these experts to do.

126
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,440
MAN: We found out
by one phone call.

127
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,280
You guys have a whole
legal department.

128
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,960
OK, you know, you know that
things are not going well

129
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,400
when you lose the moral
high ground to a "TMZ" reporter,

130
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,800
a man--a man whose employer ran
a story this week titled,

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,800
"Nicki Minaj bamboobles
her ass critics."

132
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,520
And the thing is,
Goodell wasn't

133
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,080
just getting criticized
in the room.

134
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,840
If you were watching on ESPN,

135
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,360
you could see NFL players
live-Tweet the proceedings,

136
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,520
including Darius Butler,
who wrote,

137
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,200
"This press conference
is pointless."

138
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,320
But truly--but truly,
the single greatest reaction

139
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,920
to the entire Goodell
press conference debacle

140
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,280
came from wide receiver
Sidney Rice,

141
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,760
who wrote simply,
"Boo this man...

142
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,800
Ghost emoji."

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,040
And I really think
that says it all.

144
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,920
Bravo, Sidney. Bravo.

145
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,920
Boo this man,
ghost emoji, indeed.

146
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,560
And now this.

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,240
You always sort of gauge
everything right in life

148
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,840
based on how close we come to "The Jetsons."

149
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,480
Remember "The Jetsons"?
The family flying in their car?

150
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,440
"The Jetsons," right?
Remember that cartoon?

151
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,040
Technology is gonna make it
so that

152
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,880
we only work
4 days a week.

153
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,880
MAN: "The Jetsons"!

154
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,800
WOMAN: Does anyone
other than the Jetsons

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,640
and some people in
Silicon Valley do this?

156
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,920
MAN:
It's like "The Jetsons."

157
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,800
It's like
"The Jetsons."

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's like
from "The Jetsons."

159
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,800
Don't you think it's
like "The Jetsons"?

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,400
George Jetson, and what
was the name of the dog?

161
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,640
WOMAN: Elmo.

162
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,680
MAN: Oh, how could I forget?
Oh, Astro.

163
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,080
Astro.
Astro?

164
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
Astro was the name
of the dog. "Ruff-right!"

165
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,200
Yeah, it wasn't
Elmo. Ha ha ha!

166
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,000
That was a different little kid.
Yeah.

167
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Moving on. Moving on.
Moving on.

168
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,000
Let's talk--let's talk
about Cuba.

169
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,320
You don't hear much about
it on American television,

170
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,480
unless Anthony Bourdain
takes a trip there

171
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,040
to try their street food

172
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,120
whilst drunkenly speculating
about dead men's genitals.

173
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,960
My theory always was that

174
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,400
Hemingway was hung
like a hamster,

175
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,000
not that there's
anything wrong with that.

176
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,720
Oh, oh, you're right.

177
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,480
There's absolutely
nothing wrong with that.

178
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,560
We Googled hamster penis,
and this is what you find.

179
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,640
That's adorable.

180
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,360
There is nothing wrong
with that.

181
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,920
But, look, I digress.

182
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,680
Cuba.

183
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,640
Earlier this month,
the president

184
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,520
made a major decision regarding
U.S. relations with Cuba,

185
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,240
although you probably
didn't hear about it

186
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,160
unless you were watching
Spanish-language television.

187
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,800
Yes, America has renewed
its trade embargo with Cuba.

188
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,600
That's a big deal.
And yet that was the only clip

189
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,120
we could find reporting it.

190
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,360
Because apparently,
Spanish-speaking people

191
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,800
are the only ones who give

192
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,840
whatever the Spanish
for "two shits" is.

193
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,440
I'm guessing it's "Dos Equis."
Now, first, first,

194
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,800
and I'll admit this,
I'll admit this,

195
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,600
I had no idea the Cuban embargo
had to be renewed once a year.

196
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,000
I just assumed it was like
an Amazon Prime trial.

197
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,800
You just--you sign up once
and it simply rolls on

198
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,960
without you even noticing.

199
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,840
But apparently, one of
the components of the embargo

200
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,960
is the Trading
with the Enemy Act,

201
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,000
which requires that
the president must annually

202
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,960
sign a piece of paper
saying that its

203
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,040
continuation for one year
is in the national interest,

204
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,800
which is a strangely routine way
to go about renewing legislation

205
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,880
which in Cuba is
deeply controversial.

206
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,800
WOMAN: The embargo is a constant
talking point on the island,

207
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,640
and most Cubans blame it for
the shortages of everything,

208
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,080
from concrete to build roads
and houses to food shortages.

209
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,040
Cubans blame the embargo
for everything--

210
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,840
the economy, the weather,

211
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,720
the complete collapse of
"Homeland" in its second season,

212
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,640
which--which to be fair,
Cubans probably haven't seen,

213
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,000
but if they do, they'll hate it

214
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,640
and they'll blame
the embargo for it.

215
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,960
The embargo seems like
something from a different era,

216
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,920
and that is probably
because it is.

217
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,920
WOMAN: The U.S. embargo
was put into place

218
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,040
by President Kennedy in 1962.

219
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,800
Exactly. The Cuban embargo
dates back to the Kennedy era.

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,920
And at the time, it probably
made some sense.

221
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,160
We'd just been through
the Cuban Missile Crisis,

222
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,040
which was the closest we'd
ever been to Armageddon

223
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,000
until the explosive reaction

224
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,920
to the "Fifty Shades of Grey"
casting announcement.

225
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,800
I'm sorry, but Jamie Dornan
has all the charisma

226
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,840
of a sandwich bag filled with
iceberg lettuce.

227
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,880
He is not my Christian.
#notmychristian.

228
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,400
But--but, look,
it's--it's been a while.

229
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,080
It's been a while since
Cuba was a genuine threat.

230
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,320
And by continuing the embargo,
we're not just pissing them off,

231
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,960
we're pissing off almost
the entire world.

232
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,600
WOMAN: The U.N. General Assembly
is pressing for the 22nd time,

233
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,840
by the way, for the U.S. to end
its embargo against the country.

234
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,400
188 countries voted for
lifting the embargo.

235
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,320
Israel was the only country
that joined the U.S.

236
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,960
in voting against this.

237
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:00,400
Ah, yes, the U.S. and Israel together alone again.

238
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,400
Although to be fair, in 2012,
the group supporting the embargo

239
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,200
did have another
powerful member,

240
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,000
specifically, the island nation
of Palau.

241
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,200
What a coalition--America,
Israel, and Palau.

242
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,320
The peanut butter and jelly

243
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,840
and traditional Palauan
fruit-bat soup

244
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,800
of foreign policy.

245
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,760
But last year, last year,
even Palau decided

246
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,360
it couldn't support
the embargo anymore.

247
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,560
And you know what they say--
when you've lost Palau,

248
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,200
you can forget about
the Maldives.

249
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,240
Sure, you've got to remember
the Maldives first,

250
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,760
but then you have
to forget about them.

251
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,920
But look, don't listen
to the rest of the world.

252
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,840
Who gives a shit
what they think?

253
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,680
The truth is, even our own
standards for this embargo

254
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,440
seem a little bit shaky.

255
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,800
Remember the Trading with
the Enemy Act from earlier?

256
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,880
Well, Cuba is currently
the only country on it.

257
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,880
There used to be another one
until this happened.

258
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,840
I'm issuing a proclamation
that lifts the provisions

259
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,240
of the Trading with the Enemy
Act with respect to North Korea.

260
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,880
Not even North Korea
is on that list anymore!

261
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,360
And, look, a list of enemies
without them is like a list of

262
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,400
cycloptic clawed penises

263
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,680
without the 2012
Olympic mascots.

264
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,880
It's meaningless.
Your list is incomplete,

265
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,480
which is not to say that
the Cuban government

266
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,320
is a good regime.

267
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,800
Look, in Freedom House's
most recent report,

268
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,480
Cuba got a repression score
of 6.5 out of 7.

269
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,640
Which does sound embargo-worthy
were it not for the fact that

270
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,000
many of our biggest trading
partners have similar scores.

271
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,920
China also got a 6.5,
and Saudi Arabia got a full 7.

272
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,320
And do you know how hard it is
to get a perfect score?

273
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,640
They'll dock you a full point

274
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,560
just for hooking up jumper
cables to the wrong testicle.

275
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,840
But--but we're happy
to overlook those scores.

276
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,600
We do it all the time.

277
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,560
Because if we only
traded with countries

278
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,520
with perfect
human rights records,

279
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,080
our only imports would be
maple syrup and Smurfs.

280
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,520
And perhaps the craziest
part of all of this

281
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,800
is that if you really
want the perfect argument

282
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,280
for ending the Cuban embargo,

283
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,280
you don't need to listen to any
other country on the planet.

284
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,400
You just need
to listen to this guy.

285
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,600
Sure, we could acknowledge that
or we could just keep doing it

286
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,840
until it somehow
magically unfails.

287
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,600
52nd year's the charm, baby!
Whoo!

288
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,160
And now this.

289
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,480
Teachable moment, Chris.

290
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,680
We all need
those sometimes.

291
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,920
I have them, like,
what, every 17 seconds?

292
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,320
About that, yeah,

293
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,280
Ba ha ha ha!

294
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,080
MAN: Very good.

295
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,000
We're ready, Will Ferrell.
I hope it's true.

296
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:17,840
Amy certainly is.

297
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,320
OK.

298
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,920
And finally, finally tonight,

299
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,920
last Sunday, last Sunday, one
of the weirdest annual events

300
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,680
on television
took place yet again.

301
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,600
MAN: Get ready for
the lip gloss, the spray tans,

302
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,160
the blood, sweat, and sequins.

303
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,760
I'm pumped up!

304
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,800
Ladies and gentlemen,
your 2015

305
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,040
Miss America
semifinalists!

306
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,280
Beautiful!

307
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,360
Beautiful!

308
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,960
And just a reminder
to those of you at home,

309
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,000
it is the year 2014
and I am a fully clothed man

310
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,600
standing in front of a line of

311
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,400
women in swimsuits
awaiting judgment!

312
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,920
Beautiful! Beautiful!

313
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,800
Yes, last Sunday was
the Miss America pageant.

314
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,480
And through it all, the
swimsuits, the dance numbers,

315
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,760
the inexplicable ventriloquism,

316
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,800
it was--it was very difficult
not to think,

317
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,120
How the fuck is this
still happening?

318
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,840
Beauty pageants
haven't really made sense

319
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,360
since an era when people
talked like this.

320
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,160
MAN: Girls, girls, girls.
Every one lovely and talented.

321
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,000
One from nearly every state
in the union, including Alaska.

322
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,840
Oh! Including Alaska, yes!

323
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,280
And you know why
they mention that?

324
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,280
Because Alaska had only just
become a state back then.

325
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,920
In fact, in the early days,
it made sense to have a contest

326
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,960
with criteria like this.

327
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,960
MAN: The very first years,
there was a literal breakdown.

328
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,680
Five points for the construction
of the head,

329
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,920
5 points for the limbs,

330
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,800
3 points for the torso,
two points for the leg.

331
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Three points for the torso.

332
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,480
I think even back then,
that was code.

333
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,200
"Hey, I met this
great dame, see?

334
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,960
"She's got a great torso, see?

335
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,160
34D torso.
You should meet her."

336
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,720
"How's the construction
of her head?"

337
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,000
"It's ridiculous.
It's ridiculous."

338
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,880
But the only time that beauty
pageants are relevant nowadays

339
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,120
is whenever someone forwards you
a link to something like this.

340
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,240
I believe that our education
like such as in

341
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,400
South Africa and the Iraq--
everywhere like such as and

342
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,800
I believe that they should--

343
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,080
our education over here
in the U.S.

344
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,800
should help the U.S.--or should
help South Africa

345
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,400
and should help the Iraq
and the Asian countries.

346
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,400
Now--now--now to be fair,
the question she was asked was,

347
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,280
can you do an impression of a
dictionary in a washing machine,

348
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,600
and--and I think everyone--
she nailed that.

349
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,200
She nailed that.

350
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,840
Look, look, look, it is easy

351
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,800
to make fun of
pageant contestants.

352
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,600
But which is really crazier?

353
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,160
That they sometimes give stupid answers,

354
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,120
or that they are
almost always asked

355
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,880
ridiculously complex questions?

356
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,680
Government tracking
of phone records

357
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,600
has been
in the news lately.

358
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,600
Is this an invasion
of privacy

359
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,040
or necessary to keep
our country safe?

360
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,680
Why or why not?

361
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,880
Should people who
leak classified documents

362
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,440
in the name of
public information

363
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,920
be charged
with treason?

364
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,920
MAN: In recent weeks,
the U.S. has released

365
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,880
5 detainees
from Guantanamo

366
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,920
in exchange for
one U.S. soldier

367
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,440
held captive
in Afghanistan.

368
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,800
The U.S. policy is to
leave no soldier behind.

369
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Do you think it's fair to sacrifice
or swap lives

370
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,720
in order to uphold
this policy?

371
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,800
What?

372
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,880
I totally agree with the guy
in the background there,

373
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,120
because I sincerely doubt the
intricacies of hostage exchanges

374
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,480
are going to be resolved
by a 21-year-old P.R. major

375
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,600
and the star of "Sharknado."

376
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,960
In fact, last Sunday,
this was an actual question.

377
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,200
WOMAN: The savagery of the
ISIS threat to our security

378
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,800
was demonstrated by
the gruesome videos

379
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,160
of two journalists
and an aid worker

380
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,200
being beheaded.

381
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,840
What should our
country's response be?

382
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,800
That's right--they asked one of
the contestants to solve ISIS.

383
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,800
And she only had
20 seconds to do it.

384
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,760
How did she do?

385
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,120
This is
an absolute outrage,

386
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,840
and something definitely
needs to be done

387
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,960
but I don't think
America needs to be

388
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,120
the only one to do it.

389
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,720
I really think it's
important for the world,

390
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,400
for the U.N., to come
together and decide

391
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,160
what's the best thing
united that we can do

392
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,080
to really come together
as a bigger

393
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,560
and more
impactful source

394
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,960
to end this horrid, horrid thing
that's happening.

395
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,800
Holy shit!

396
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That is a much better answer

397
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,000
than I could've done
in that amount of time.

398
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,800
That is a borderline
better answer

399
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,240
than the president
gave last week.

400
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,880
In fact, many of
last Sunday's contestants

401
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,800
were genuinely impressive.

402
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,480
And the Miss America
pageant would argue

403
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,720
that's because they're
a classier organization

404
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,720
than their competitors,
which is frankly not difficult.

405
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Miss U.S.A., for instance,
is owned by Donald Trump,

406
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,800
a clown made of mummified
foreskin and cotton candy.

407
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,440
But--and look, he's--he's
pretty blunt about his criteria.

408
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,360
Well, obviously
it's great outer beauty.

409
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,960
I mean, we could say
politically correct

410
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,280
that look
doesn't matter,

411
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,080
but the look
obviously matters.

412
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,240
Like you wouldn't have your job if you
weren't beautiful.

413
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,000
AUDIENCE: Ohh!

414
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,000
JOHN: It is a little ironic

415
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,080
that the Miss U.S.A. beauty
pageant is overseen by one of

416
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,480
the ugliest souls on the planet.

417
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,840
But--but look.
Miss America

418
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,000
is supposed to be different
from all that.

419
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,200
Miss America is about
something more than just looks.

420
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,920
This is a scholarship
pageant, Lee.

421
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,800
Miss America
funds scholars.

422
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,120
It's the largest scholarship program
in the world for women.

423
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,800
It's easy to think that this is
just a beauty pageant,

424
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,960
but this is a scholarship pageant, Miss America is.

425
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,320
Right. Yeah, right.

426
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,920
You need to see them in bathing
suits, because as we all know,

427
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,840
the intelligence portion
of the brain

428
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,000
is located somewhere
on the upper thigh.

429
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,160
In fact, Miss America trades on
their scholarship claims

430
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,000
so much, if you call
the Miss America headquarters,

431
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,720
this is what you hear.

432
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,120
OK, that is
suspiciously defensive

433
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,200
right out of the gate.

434
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,880
That is like
Walter White saying,

435
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,920
"Hello and welcome to
this regular car wash

436
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,640
"that's definitely not laundering money
for my meth lab.

437
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,920
Welcome. Welcome."

438
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,920
If, if it is actually true that
Miss America is the world's

439
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,760
largest provider
of scholarships for women,

440
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,800
that's a little bit weird,

441
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,920
because Miss America does not
offer scholarships to all women,

442
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,360
only those who compete
in its pageants.

443
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,160
So, to qualify
for a scholarship,

444
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,440
you'll need to certify not just
that you've never been married

445
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,920
but also that you are not now pregnant

446
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,480
and never have been.

447
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,120
Which, of course, makes sense.

448
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,280
Miss America is supposed to be
a role model for children.

449
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,760
How can she be that
if she's got a child in tow

450
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,000
who's constantly
looking up to her?

451
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,000
And those--those are
just the official rules

452
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,480
you need to abide by.

453
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,120
If you want a shot at winning
one of their scholarships,

454
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,040
you're also going to need
access to a can of this stuff.

455
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,600
WOMAN: Butt glue,
a spray adhesive

456
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,040
essential for keeping those
bikini bottoms on their bottoms.

457
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,000
Just--just think
about that for a second.

458
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,920
"How did the scholarship
interview go?"

459
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,800
"Well, my ass is still sticky.
I think I got it.

460
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,360
I think I got it."

461
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,720
And Miss America--
Miss America doesn't just

462
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,920
say it's the biggest
scholarship organization,

463
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,800
it backs this up with numbers.

464
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,840
We're
the nation's largest

465
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,680
scholarship program
for young women

466
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,560
with $45 million
made available annually.

467
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,200
$45 million. That is an unbelievable amount of money,

468
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,200
as in, "I literally
didn't believe that."

469
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,920
It's the kind of number
that can get stuck in your head

470
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,600
and rattle around there
for days, driving you crazy,

471
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,040
making you wish, for instance,

472
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,000
there was a way
to find out more.

473
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,800
Find out more at

474
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,920
MissAmericaFoundation.org.

475
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,000
And that is where
all this craziness began.

476
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,280
We went to their web site
and to be honest,

477
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,800
it wasn't a great sign
that their "about us" page

478
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
says, "We Fun Scholars!"

479
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,240
You--you really might want to--

480
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,800
you really might want
to butt glue a "D"

481
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,600
onto the end of that word.

482
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,800
But it was then, while digging
around on their site,

483
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,800
that we discovered that
Miss America and its foundation

484
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,280
are registered non-profits,

485
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,000
which means they have
to file public tax forms.

486
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,400
So what we were looking for was
that crazy number, $45 million.

487
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,800
What we found instead was that
in 2012, at the national level,

488
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,400
they spent less than $500,000

489
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,640
in cash scholarships,

490
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,800
leaving us a mere
$44,500,000 short

491
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,840
of what they say they provide.

492
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,000
And at this point,
we really had a clear choice.

493
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,720
We could've just thought, "Sure,
the numbers don't really add up,

494
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,320
but it's only Miss America.
Who really gives a shit?"

495
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,760
Or, or, we could try
to pull the tax forms

496
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,000
from every state-level
competition in the country,

497
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:30,600
because this was starting
to drive us fucking insane.

498
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,720
It's been a weird week here.

499
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,880
We got 33 states' 990 forms

500
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,800
and attempted to
contact everyone else.

501
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,160
But even making the most
generous assumptions

502
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,920
for every state and local
pageant that we didn't get,

503
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,720
we couldn't get even close
to $4 million

504
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,400
when, remember,
they are claiming this...

505
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,320
$45 million made
available annually.

506
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,800
How the fuck is that possible?
How's that possible?

507
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,680
At this point, we were
in way too deep,

508
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,600
so we just called Miss America,

509
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,840
which is when
we first heard this:

510
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,800
WOMAN: Thank you for calling
the Miss America Organization,

511
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
the world's largest provider
of scholarships for women.

512
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,200
JOHN: And it turns out, the key
word there is "provider."

513
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,800
Some schools offer scholarships
directly to pageant contestants,

514
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,280
and the trick is Miss America
counts all of them,

515
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,600
not just the ones
they can physically take.

516
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,120
So, for instance,
Miss Pennsylvania's web site

517
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,240
says it offers the winner scholarships
to these 4 colleges.

518
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,200
And the value of every single
scholarship is counted together,

519
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,000
despite the fact that she is
clearly going to attend

520
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,000
at most one because she's not
going to attend 4 colleges.

521
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,800
She's not James fucking Franco!

522
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,200
Furthermore, furthermore,

523
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,120
Miss Alabama in its 2012 filing

524
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,960
said it provided nearly
$2.6 million in scholarships

525
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,760
to just one school, Troy
University, which blew my mind.

526
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,720
Because if that's true,
that must be

527
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,000
the single prettiest
school anywhere in America.

528
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,160
But when we contacted Troy,

529
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,160
it turns out the pageant
got to that $2.6 million

530
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,480
by multiplying the value of
a single scholarship by 48,

531
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,120
the number of competitors who
could theoretically accept it,

532
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,720
even though the actual
number of contestants

533
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,800
who accepted a scholarship
that year was--

534
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,800
and you are not going
to believe this--zero.

535
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,880
Absolute zero.

536
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,560
Meaning that
the difference between

537
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,960
the money they "provided"
and the money they "awarded"

538
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,000
was all of the money
they provided.

539
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,280
And--and at this point,
we just had to stop

540
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,840
because it was 35 minutes ago,
and we had to tape this show.

541
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,800
But it does seem that
two things are true.

542
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,200
One, Miss America
gives out way less

543
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,760
than $45 million
in scholarships.

544
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,080
And yet, two,
whatever the number is,

545
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,520
one thing does still seem
to be troublingly true.

546
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,200
The Miss America
Organization is

547
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,800
actually the largest
provider of

548
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
scholarships to women
in the world.

549
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,840
Yeah, because even
their lowest number

550
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,520
is more than any other
women-only

551
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,040
scholarship that we could find,

552
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,000
more than the Society
of Women Engineers,

553
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,640
whose web site is here,

554
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,200
more than the Patsy Mink
Foundation, here,

555
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,960
and more than
the Jeanette Rankin

556
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,480
Women's Scholarship Fund, here.

557
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,800
All of which you can donate to
if you want to change the fact

558
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,600
that currently, the biggest
scholarship program

559
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
exclusively for women in America

560
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,720
requires you to be unmarried
with a mint-condition uterus,

561
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,360
and also rewards
working knowledge

562
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,000
of buttock adhesive technology,

563
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,000
which is just
a little bit unsettling.

564
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,040
And, in fact, let me
try to explain why

565
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,120
to the Miss America Organization

566
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,400
through the only medium
it seems to value,

567
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,160
20-second conversations

568
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,800
with women
in evening dresses and sashes.

569
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:57,200
Please join me.

570
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,880
Welcome to Miss "Last Week Tonight"!

571
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,480
I'm proud to say
as of now, we are

572
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,400
the world's largest provider
of scholarships for women,

573
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,960
because tonight, 400 million
$1.00 scholarships

574
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,920
will be made available
to the winner,

575
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,800
of which she may choose
just one.

576
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,840
So, let's bring out
our first contestant,

577
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,640
Miss First Contestant.

578
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,480
Radiant.

579
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,360
Question number one.

580
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,040
What does the
continued existence

581
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,800
of the Miss America
pageant say

582
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,760
about how women are
viewed in America?

583
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,920
You have
20 seconds. Go.

584
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,160
Beginning with the Seneca
Falls Convention in 1848

585
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,960
that spurred
first wave feminism,

586
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,800
the perception of
women in America

587
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,800
has always been
complex and fluid.

588
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,600
While it is
theoretically possible

589
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,280
that Miss America
could evolve into

590
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,800
a purely academic
scholarship organization,

591
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
at this point in time,
the notion that

592
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,120
beauty pageants
are about

593
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,000
anything other than
outer beauty

594
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,360
is belied both by
the continued existence

595
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,480
of the swimsuit portion
and the fact that

596
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,240
I'm expected to answer this
question in just 20 seconds.

597
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,920
Thank you very much.

598
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,800
That's tremendous.
Tremendous. Beautiful.

599
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,440
And now please welcome

600
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:11,880
our final contender,
Miss Kathy Griffin.

601
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,600
Miss Kathy,
your question.

602
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,600
When providing access
to scholarships,

603
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,400
is there
any place whatsoever

604
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,600
for the judgment
of a woman's body?

605
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,240
Oh, I have no
problem with that at all.

606
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,960
Wait. What? Really?

607
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,800
Nope, no problem
whatsoever.

608
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,640
As long as men are subjected to the same
demeaning process.

609
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,840
Let me show you
what I mean.

610
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,200
Giuseppe,
get out here.

611
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,800
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no. Oh, shit.

612
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,960
Uh, OK, all right. What exactly are you
doing here, Kathy?

613
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,240
All right, I am judging you
as a host next to him.

614
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,840
Uh, well-- All right, John,
walk that runway.

615
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,840
Give us a twirl.

616
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,320
Shit. He's just--

617
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,760
Hosting is about a lot
more than looks, Kathy.

618
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,880
It's about just--

619
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,440
Now, don't do that
with your hands.

620
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,880
It's not just about-- it's not just about
looks, Kathy.

621
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,800
Well, look, that's only
20% of your total score.

622
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,320
Now, I'm giving
this one to Giuseppe

623
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,760
because, frankly,
he wins on

624
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,840
muscle mass, legs, and of course,
construction of the head.

625
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,240
OK, OK, OK,
I get your point.

626
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,040
No, let me explain why I'm giving you
a lower score.

627
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,400
I look at Giuseppe and I
want to have sex with him.

628
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,720
I look at you, and I want
to have sex with Giuseppe.

629
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,720
Oh, come on, Kathy.
I'm a good person, Kathy.

630
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,840
You know what?
I am calling it!

631
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,880
Giuseppe wins!
No!

632
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,320
No way Giuseppe wins!

633
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,600
No, get off me, Giuseppe.

634
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,840
I'm not happy for you.
I'm not happy for you.

635
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,400
I feel terrible
about myself!

636
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,400
Pageants are horrible!
They're horrible!

637
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,920
That's our show.
My thanks to Kathy Griffin.

638
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,640
My thanks to
Kathy Griffin.

639
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,000
Fuck you, Giuseppe!

640
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,400
Please, please join us
again next week.

641
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,400
We'll see you
next week. Good night!

642
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,000
Good-bye.

643
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,640
I feel bad
about myself.
