1
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,680
Welcome, welcome, welcome to "Last Week Tonight."

2
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,960
I'm John Oliver.

3
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,680
Just time for a quick recap of the week.

4
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,480
If you've been here in New York, it has been dominated

5
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,200
by the UN General Assembly, the annual event

6
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,360
where delegates come from all over the world

7
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,720
to fuck up this city's traffic.

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,120
Almost every world leader has been here,

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,400
but no one has had a bigger impact

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,920
than Indian prime minister Narendra Modi.

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,680
Just this morning, he gave a sold-out speech

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,040
at Madison Square Garden that featured everything

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,880
from dance numbers
to a live-on-stage painter

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,800
creating a speed portrait
of him.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,200
I've got to say, Modi,
classic out-of-towner move--

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,840
comes to New York,
stays a few days,

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,840
and leaves with
a slapdash caricature

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,760
done in the Times Square area.

19
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,800
You're a cliche, Modi.
You're a cliche.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,920
But perhaps Modi's
crowning glory during the trip

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,760
was his appearance
at last night's

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,960
Global Citizen concert
in Central Park.

23
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,360
It wasn't that he gave
a great speech.

24
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,720
It's that he had
one hell of a finish.

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,800
What?

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That--wow.

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,560
That is a power move right there--

28
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,480
standing next to Wolverine and
throwing out "Star Wars" quotes.

29
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,960
Bear in mind,
this guy was banned

30
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,800
from entering the United States
up until just 4 months ago

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,680
for his role
in the Gujarat riots.

32
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,640
That's quite a turnaround
for him,

33
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,240
and let me say this
to all other world leaders.

34
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,320
This is the new bar.

35
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,720
Do not turn up
to this city again

36
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,960
unless you are with
an A-list movie star

37
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,520
and throwing out quotes
from films

38
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,960
that they were
definitely not in.

39
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,920
For instance, Robert Mugabe
is not welcome here

40
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,920
unless he's standing
next to Billy Crystal

41
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,680
shouting, "To infinity
and beyond!"

42
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,880
for no reason whatsoever,

43
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,160
and I do not want to see
Angela Merkel

44
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,680
set foot on American soil
unless she is with Vin Diesel

45
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,920
and screaming,
"I will have what she's having.

46
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,040
I will have what she's having."

47
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,640
Moving on, moving on.
In much less fun news,

48
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,080
it was another difficult week
in Ferguson, Missouri,

49
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,600
where the protests
over a tragic police shooting

50
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,480
are now in their seventh week.

51
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,400
Much of the anger
is currently being focused

52
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,920
on police chief Tom Jackson
while this week,

53
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,760
he went on a PR offensive with
the emphasis on "offensive."

54
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,200
First, he issued
a business-casual apology video,

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,320
and then he did
an interview about it

56
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,280
that went wrong
within just two questions.

57
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,360
You issued an apology
video today.

58
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,040
I did.

59
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,920
Why did it take so long
for that to happen?

60
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,960
Well, there's been
so much going on.

61
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,680
Ooh, that is not a good answer.

62
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,920
"Look. It has been busy.
Football season is back.

63
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,880
"There was
the "Ninja Turtles" reboot,

64
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,840
crazy line for the new iPhone,
just a lot going on."

65
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,000
In an inexplicable move,
he then decided to do this.

66
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,840
CHARLIE ROSE: Chief Tom Jackson
spoke to demonstrators.

67
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,080
They want criminal charges
after last month's shooting

68
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,600
of Michael Brown.

69
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,760
When Jackson started to march
with them, scuffles broke out.

70
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,720
Yeah. Of course they did.

71
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,360
What was he thinking,
trying to march with them?

72
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,880
"Oh, wow, big turnout, everyone.
What are we protesting?"

73
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,680
"Well, for one, you, asshole."

74
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,520
Now at this point,
you might be thinking,

75
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,880
"Why on earth didn't
the Ferguson Police Department

76
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,240
just get a PR expert
to help them through all this?"

77
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,160
Well, they did.
There's just one problem.

78
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,200
And we're learning more tonight
about the man

79
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,880
overseeing public relations
for Ferguson

80
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,760
after the Michael Brown
shooting.

81
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,000
According to our partners
at the "Post-Dispatch,"

82
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,800
32-year-old Devon Sean James

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,320
once shot and killed
an unarmed man.

84
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,720
What the fuck, Ferguson?

85
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,160
How hard can it be to find
a PR expert

86
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,520
who has not done the exact thing

87
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,480
that you are hiring a PR expert
to deal with?

88
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,560
I mean, let's just say you have
two applicants in front of you.

89
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,720
One of them shot someone,
and the other one is a potato.

90
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,480
I don't care how qualified
the other guy is.

91
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,280
You have to hire the potato.

92
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,480
Plus, if things don't work out,
you have a potato.

93
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,160
And finally this week,
the world said good-bye

94
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,040
to Afghanistan president
Hamid Karzai,

95
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,000
the man that America
was trusting with overseeing

96
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,920
the roughly $100 billion in aid
that we have poured

97
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,520
into that country
over the past 12 years.

98
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,920
Karzai used his farewell speech
to thank everyone.

99
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,040
Almost everyone.

100
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,840
Karzai thanked
8 other countries by name

101
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,080
for helping Afghanistan rebuild.

102
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,800
He failed to mention
the United States.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,640
Whoa! Whoa there, Karzai.

104
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,720
Was this an Academy Awards
situation

105
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,560
where you just ran out of time?

106
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,000
Because I didn't hear
any music playing you off there.

107
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,800
"Oh, I'd like to thank, uh,
China, Germany, India, Iran.

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,440
"You guys are the greatest.

109
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,960
Couldn't have done it
without you."

110
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,120
"I'd like to thank
my whole team at ICM,

111
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,920
"my publicist Leslee Dart.

112
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,000
"I'm king of the world!
That's it. Thank you very much.

113
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,000
"Oh, shit! And America.
And America.

114
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,360
"Did we go to commercial?
Fuck! Fuck.

115
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,160
"I'll write them a note.

116
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,680
I'll write them a note.
It's fine."

117
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,360
To be fair, Karzai did
mention us during his speech,

118
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,440
just not in a particularly
flattering way.

119
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,920
In his farewell speech,
the Afghan leader

120
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,080
warned hundreds of staff
and cabinet members

121
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,640
not to trust
the U.S. government.

122
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,960
He called the American
mission there a betrayal,

123
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,040
saying the United States,
quote, "Did not want peace."

124
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,040
Oh, excuse me, Karzai?

125
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,960
I thought we were gonna go
our separate ways like adults,

126
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,400
specifically, polite
but with an inner hate

127
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,320
that will eventually
devour us alive,

128
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,080
but if you want to go out
with backstabbing and low blows,

129
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,960
that is no problem.

130
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,560
For instance,
your brother Quayum

131
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,520
apparently owns
a restaurant in Baltimore.

132
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,000
You insult us--guess what--
we're gonna read

133
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,840
some of his bad Yelp reviews
on national television.

134
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,720
For example--
For example, Amanda E.--

135
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,040
Amanda E. noted that
her "Shornakhod included

136
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,680
"a number of other beans,
not that it mattered

137
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,680
since it was way over soaked
in the cilantro dressing."

138
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,440
Boom, Karzai!
Oh, you want a little more?

139
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,240
You want more? Fine.

140
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,040
Ashu M. found the food there
"Overrated, bland,

141
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,920
"and like it was
out of a college student's

142
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,880
"first effort in the kitchen
with spices.

143
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,440
Ugh."

144
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,960
Right?

145
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,440
If you ever show your face
back in America, Karzai,

146
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,040
it better be with
a peace offering and a good one.

147
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,880
I'm talking you standing
next to Ryan Gosling

148
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,480
shouting, "Show me the money!"

149
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,880
And now this.

150
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,080
MALE ANNOUNCER: And now...

151
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,920
George was popping
the tequilas.

152
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,360
Next thing you know,
the A-word is flying.

153
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,360
The A-word.

154
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,360
The B-word
is out there.

155
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,360
The B-word.

156
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,440
He called her
the C-word.

157
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,560
The C-word.

158
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,560
The D-word.

159
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,760
The E-word--
"excommunicated."

160
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,080
The F-word.
The G-word.

161
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,440
I want to see a president
doesn't just say the H-word.

162
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,800
The I-word.
The J-word.

163
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,440
The K-word.
The L-word.

164
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,760
The N-word.
The N-word.

165
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,800
The N-word.

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,360
The N-word,
as in N-word Mountain.

167
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,520
The O-word.

168
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
The P-word.
The Q-word.

169
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
Now we're talking about the R-word.

170
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,040
The R-word.

171
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,600
The S-word.
The T-word.

172
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,920
It's the old U-word.

173
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,680
What's the V-word?
"Visibility."

174
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,720
The "W-word."

175
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,840
All words that
start with "X."

176
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,920
The Y-word.

177
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,400
The so-called "Z-word."

178
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,760
Moving on, our main story--

179
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,880
Our main story tonight--drones.

180
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,000
They're the third most annoying
thing in the sky

181
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,280
after mosquitoes and plastic
bags caught in the breeze.

182
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,360
They are not gorgeous, weird kid
from "American Beauty."

183
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,880
They're trash,
and they kill sea turtles.

184
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,840
You got turtle blood
on your hands.

185
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,520
But all of a sudden,
drones are everywhere.

186
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,320
We even use them to shoot
romantic wedding videos,

187
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:47,320
and what could possibly
go wrong with that?

188
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,200
He's fine. He's fine.

189
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,120
He's probably fine.
I don't know if he's fine.

190
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,880
It's funny whether
he's fine or not, but look.

191
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,680
Overseas, drones are a slightly
more serious matter.

192
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,440
For instance, this week,
we reportedly launched

193
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,560
deadly drone strikes in both
Waziristan and Yemen.

194
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,560
You probably didn't hear
about them on the news

195
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,640
unless you were watching this.

196
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,240
The U.S. has carried out
another drone attack

197
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,240
in Pakistan's wrested
tribal areas,

198
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,000
killing at least 8 people.

199
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,920
That's the only footage
reporting either strike

200
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,280
that we could find, and it's
from the Iranian government's

201
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,360
English-language TV station.

202
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,320
That channel is buried
deep in your cable package.

203
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,160
I think it's actually somewhere
between C-SPAN Junior!

204
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,040
and KAN,
the Kirstie Alley Network,

205
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,760
but there is something strange
about the fact that we launched

206
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,960
deadly drone strikes
in two sovereign nations

207
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,120
that almost no one here
heard about,

208
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,240
but then again,
why would it make the news?

209
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,240
We use drones all the time.

210
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,200
Hard numbers are very difficult
to come by

211
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,520
for reasons that we'll get into,
but by one estimate,

212
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,840
during the Obama administration,
we've launched 8 times

213
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,400
the number of drone strikes than
we did under his predecessor,

214
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,640
and while they've declined a bit recently,

215
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,640
drone strikes will be
as much a characteristic

216
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,840
of the Obama presidency
as Obamacare

217
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,520
or receiving racist e-mail
forwards from distant relatives,

218
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,760
and it's easy to see
why drones are so popular.

219
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,840
They cost less
than manned planes,

220
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,840
and they kill
a lot of terrorists.

221
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,600
Their slogan should really be

222
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,960
"Appealingly cheap
and incredibly deadly,"

223
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,840
but, unfortunately, that's
already been taken by Hardee's.

224
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,480
And they're not just popular
with the White House.

225
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,560
Surveys consistently show,
a majority of Americans

226
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,680
approve of our use
of drone strikes

227
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,280
to fight extremists abroad.

228
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,600
In fact, we're
so comfortable with them,

229
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,160
nobody blinked an eye when
the president said this.

230
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,280
The Jonas Brothers are here.

231
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,560
They're out there somewhere.

232
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,680
Sasha and Malia are huge fans,

233
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,040
but, boys, don't get any ideas.

234
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,880
I have two words for you--

235
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,200
predator drones.

236
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,000
You will never see it coming.

237
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,880
"Ha ha ha!

238
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,400
"You'll lie there, your aortas
riddled with shrapnel

239
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,680
"fired from the sky, gurgling
your last blood-soaked breath.

240
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,920
"It's funny
'cause it's possible.

241
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,680
I could do that.
That's something I could do."

242
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,560
But while our drone program
is widely accepted,

243
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,760
we really know
relatively little about it.

244
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,480
We spent a lot of time
this week trying to find

245
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,040
some concrete answers
to basic questions,

246
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,880
and it's surprisingly difficult.

247
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,320
For instance, how do we decide
when to use a drone strike?

248
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,920
Now, on the surface,

249
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,880
the Obama administration's
answer seems straightforward.

250
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,840
We only take these kinds
of actions

251
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,400
when there's an imminent threat,
when capture is not feasible,

252
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,840
and when we are confident
that we're doing so in a way

253
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,000
that's consistent with federal
and international law.

254
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,080
OK. That sounds reassuring
until you look closer at it

255
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,160
because our rules
for drone strikes

256
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,160
are a little like
Harvey Keitel's balls.

257
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,400
We've all seen them
in "The Piano,"

258
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,880
"Bad Lieutenant,"
or on Snapchat,

259
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,360
and from a distance, you think,

260
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,480
"Well, I understand
the contours of those,"

261
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,280
but if you were
to really examine them,

262
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,840
you'd discover that they're
actually lost

263
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,320
in a haze of fuzziness
and gray areas,

264
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,280
much like the rules
for our drone strikes.

265
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,000
As Eric Holder just said,
drone strikes are justified

266
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,520
if you can show
an "imminent threat."

267
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,920
Now, that sounds clear.

268
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,960
There's not much
of a linguistic loophole there

269
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,960
unless you make one.

270
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,520
MALE REPORTER: NBC News
has obtained this confidential,

271
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,080
16-page Justice Department memo.

272
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,640
It says, an "imminent threat...
does not require

273
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,600
"the United States
to have clear evidence

274
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,960
"that a specific attack
on U.S. persons and interests

275
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,440
will take place
in the immediate future."

276
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,880
But an imminent threat
does have to take place

277
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,600
in the immediate future
because that's what

278
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,280
the fucking word
"imminent" means.

279
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,840
When someone says, "I'm going
to have a baby imminently,"

280
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,840
It doesn't mean,
"I may or may not have a baby

281
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,200
at some point in the future."

282
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,960
It means,
"Get your fucking car keys.

283
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,400
My water just broke."

284
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,080
And it turns out, "imminent"
isn't the only word

285
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,200
with a surprisingly
fluid definition

286
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,920
when it comes to drone strikes.

287
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,560
What defines a civilian when
it comes to civilian casualties

288
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,920
has also, allegedly,
been open to interpretation.

289
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,200
There's also been some dispute

290
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,360
over the way
civilian casualties are counted.

291
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,680
The CIA often counts
able-bodied males,

292
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,120
military-age males
who are killed in strikes

293
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,000
as militants unless they have
concrete evidence

294
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,920
to sort of prove them innocent.

295
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,640
Hold on.

296
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,280
If it's assumed
you're with the terrorists

297
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,960
if you're in the same vicinity
and around the same age as them,

298
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,120
then by that standard,
as a British man in my 30s,

299
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,640
whenever I go home to London,
I'm a member of Coldplay,

300
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,880
and that's offensive to me.

301
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,600
That's offensive.

302
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,720
I've not been in that band
for years.

303
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,840
We consciously uncoupled
a long time ago.

304
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,320
But perhaps the most incredible thing about our drone program--

305
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,120
which, again, a majority
of us support--

306
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,880
is not how little we know about
who the government is killing,

307
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,200
but how little they themselves
seem to know.

308
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,320
MALE REPORTER: NBC News has
examined classified documents

309
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,040
detailing 114 drone strikes.

310
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,160
They also reveal what
U.S. officials don't know,

311
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,800
like how many killed--
between 7 and 10 in one strike,

312
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,280
20 to 22 in another.

313
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,760
It suggests U.S. officials
don't always know

314
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,840
exactly how many
or who they're killing.

315
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,040
That is a little disturbing
because the question

316
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,720
how many people have you
killed in drone strikes

317
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,880
is not one of those questions
where it's OK to say,

318
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,080
"I don't know."

319
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,400
It's not like asking someone,

320
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,080
"Who was the voice
of Disney's Aladdin?"

321
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,400
or, "What are Skittles
made from?"

322
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,720
It's different.

323
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,760
It's different than that,
and the crazy thing is,

324
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,640
it has literally always
been like this.

325
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,160
The very first CIA drone strike
back in 2002 killed 3 men,

326
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,880
reportedly because they thought
one of them

327
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,440
"might have been Bin Laden in part"--and this is true--

328
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,920
"due to his height,"
and under that rationale,

329
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,200
it's kind of remarkable that
we didn't take out Jeff Goldblum

330
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,240
at some point over the years.

331
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,040
Now, reports later indicated
the victim was actually

332
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,800
an innocent man who was
collecting scrap metal,

333
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,120
and look how the Pentagon
immediately set the template

334
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,240
for every discussion we've had
about drone strikes since.

335
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,600
MALE REPORTER: You said
you don't know who

336
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,760
was killed
in this attack,

337
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,520
whether it's civilians,
Taliban, or--

338
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,920
I'm sorry.

339
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,200
We don't know
exactly who it was.

340
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,360
We don't know
the identities

341
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,720
of the individuals
involved.

342
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,560
But you're convinced
they're Taliban?

343
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,560
We're convinced
that--

344
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,480
We're convinced it was
an appropriate target

345
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,520
based on the observation,
based on the information

346
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,000
that it was
an appropriate target.

347
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,800
We do not know yet
exactly who it was.

348
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,880
It's never a good idea
to make a major decision

349
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,280
about someone when you can't
even say exactly who they are.

350
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,120
"Hey, guys,
I got married last night."

351
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,840
"Oh, really? Who is he?"

352
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,600
"I don't know exactly
at this time,

353
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,880
"but I'm convinced
he's an appropriate husband

354
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,360
based on his height."

355
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,560
And yet we have consistently
let the government

356
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,400
get away with answers like that
because drone strikes

357
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,880
are one of those things
that it's really convenient

358
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,320
not to think about that much,

359
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,640
like the daily life
of a circus elephant

360
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,880
or the fact that Beck
is a Scientologist.

361
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,240
You really don't want people
reminding you

362
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,360
about those kind of things,

363
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,120
but if you happen to live
underneath drones,

364
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,720
not thinking about them
is not an option.

365
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,160
Having drones hovering above you
is bound to mess with your head,

366
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,520
especially because you might not
even be able to see them.

367
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,280
FEMALE REPORTER: Even though
I know there's a predator

368
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,080
directly overhead,
I still can't hear a thing,

369
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,800
and if you look up
to the exact spot

370
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,680
where we're being told the
predator is flying right now,

371
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,600
there's nothing but clouds
and blue sky.

372
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,040
Congratulations, everyone.
We did it.

373
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,160
We managed to make
one of the last remaining

374
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,160
universal symbols
of pleasantness, blue sky,

375
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,160
completely fucking terrifying.

376
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,560
We did it. Whoo!

377
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,520
And look.

378
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,480
While we may not spend much time

379
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,480
thinking about
our drone strikes here,

380
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,880
in countries like Pakistan,
where they actually happen,

381
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,880
they have to deal with them
so much,

382
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,760
there are even weird,
satirical cartoons

383
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,360
featuring an American drone
and his friend

384
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,320
a dengue-fever-carrying
mosquito.

385
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,160
To be fair, that would be
a lot funnier

386
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,280
if you spoke Urdu
and lived in constant fear

387
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,640
of being murdered by a drone.

388
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,280
If you did, that's basically
"Who's On First?"

389
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,120
In fact, drone strikes
are such a routine feature

390
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,840
of life in Pakistan,

391
00:17:53,040 --> 00:18:02,920
this is how news networks
present statistics about them.

392
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,800
Drones have their own
graphics package.

393
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,880
You do not invest in top-quality
graphics like those

394
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,880
unless you know you're gonna get
a lot of use out of them.

395
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,800
It's like Las Vegas local news

396
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,800
having white tiger
mauling graphics.

397
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,400
They're going to get
their money's worth.

398
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,360
But to really understand
the psychological impact

399
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,280
of living underneath drones,
listen to this Yemeni man,

400
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,960
a man who loves America,
addressing Congress last year

401
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,920
only a week after his village
was struck by a drone.

402
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,680
I spent a year living
with an American family

403
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,760
and attended
an American high school.

404
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,040
That was one of the best years
of my life.

405
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,160
The friendships and values
I experienced

406
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,040
and described to the villagers
helped them understand

407
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,720
the America that I know
and that I love.

408
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,800
Now, however,
when they think of America,

409
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,560
they think of the terror
they feel from the drones

410
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,760
that hover over their heads

411
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,560
ready to fire missiles
at any time.

412
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,680
The drone strikes are the face
of America to many Yemenis.

413
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,680
And that kind of makes sense
because think about it this way.

414
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,800
If there were Italian
armed drones

415
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,720
hanging over your head
right now,

416
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,760
it would probably affect the way
you think about Italy.

417
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,840
In word association,
your first answer for "Italy"

418
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,360
would not be "lasagna."

419
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,480
It would be
"specter of imminent death"

420
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,840
or, more likely, "specter
of-a imminent-a death-a"

421
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,800
followed by "lasagna,"

422
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
but if you grow up
underneath drones,

423
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,760
it's going to affect
the way you see the world.

424
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,840
Listen to this 13-year-old
Pakistani boy

425
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,560
whose grandmother was killed
in a drone strike.

426
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,640
FEMALE INTERPRETER:
I no longer love blue skies.

427
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,840
In fact, I now prefer
gray skies.

428
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,240
The drones do not fly
when the skies are gray,

429
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,400
and for a short period of time,

430
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,880
the mental tension
and fear eases.

431
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,800
Look. It is completely natural
for us not to want to think

432
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,280
about the consequences
of our drone program,

433
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,640
but when children from
other countries are telling us

434
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,800
that we've made them
fear the sky,

435
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,320
it might be time to ask
some hard questions.

436
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,800
The problem is, after a week
of looking at this,

437
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,960
it seems there are shockingly
few available answers.

438
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,120
In fact, the best summation
we could find of the framework

439
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,760
we use to authorize
and justify drone strikes

440
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,920
is from this former
Defense Department advisor.

441
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,800
Right now, we have
the executive branch

442
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,360
making a claim that it has
the right to kill anyone

443
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,440
anywhere on Earth at any time
for secret reasons

444
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,240
based on secret evidence
in a secret process

445
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,480
undertaken by
unidentified officials.

446
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,600
That frightens me.

447
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,920
Yeah.

448
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,480
It probably does frighten you
because what you just described

449
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,080
sounds fucking terrifying,
and look.

450
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,800
Any counterterrorism effort
will always require

451
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,640
an element of secrecy,
but with our drone program,

452
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,880
not only do we not know
who we've killed.

453
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,440
The legal guidelines
have loopholes large enough

454
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,880
to drive a flying
death robot through,

455
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,720
and after a week spent
trying to comprehend

456
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,680
the rationales, legality,

457
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,800
and broader consequences
of our drone policy,

458
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,880
I'm starting to understand
how this guy feels.

459
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,440
Exactly. And now this.

460
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,680
MALE ANNOUNCER: And now
"Last Week Tonight" asks...

461
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,880
This week--Ayn Rand,
how is she still a thing?

462
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,960
3 decades after her death,
the writer Ayn Rand

463
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,280
is still the subject
of serious debate,

464
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,080
and not just over
how to pronounce her name.

465
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,840
Ann Rand or Ahn Rond

466
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,840
or however the moderns
pronounce it...

467
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,640
Ayn Rand, not Ann Rand...

468
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,040
Ain Rand, Ayn Rand--

469
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,920
JOHN STOSSEL:
I'm told it's Ayn Rand.

470
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,600
MALE ANNOUNCER: Ayn Rand
became famous

471
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
for her philosophy
of objectivism,

472
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,520
which is a nice way of saying
being a selfish asshole.

473
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,200
Rand illustrated her beliefs
in novels like "Atlas Shrugged"

474
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,960
and "The Fountainhead,"

475
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,880
stories of rapey heroes complaining

476
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,600
about how no one appreciates
their true genius.

477
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,440
My work done my way.

478
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,280
Nothing else
matters to me.

479
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,080
MALE ANNOUNCER: And if that
reminds you of anyone,

480
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,880
it's probably someone like this.

481
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,600
Until I'm done with
my Lamborghini entrance,

482
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,920
no one is allowed in.

483
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,880
Make sure they know that
because if they

484
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,600
start running it,
I'm gonna start pissing.

485
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,840
What about my entry?

486
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,840
MALE ANNOUNCER: Ayn Rand
has always been popular

487
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,760
with teenagers,
but she's something

488
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,320
you're supposed to grow out of,
like ska music or handjobs.

489
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,800
Curiously, though,
Rand's popularity persists

490
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,800
among a certain type of adult.

491
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,960
BRIAN LAMB: Mark Cuban,

492
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,760
how many times have you
read "Fountainhead"?

493
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,240
3 complete times.

494
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,600
You know, it's funny
because I'll pick it up

495
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,240
when I need motivation,

496
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,080
but then if I read too far,
I get too much motivation,

497
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,640
and I get too jittery,
so I have to put it down.

498
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,920
MALE ANNOUNCER: Yes.

499
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,760
Unbelievably, Mark Cuban's
favorite book

500
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,800
is about
a misunderstood visionary

501
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,680
who blows things up
when he doesn't get his way.

502
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,240
Cuban even named
his 287-foot yacht Fountainhead

503
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,880
because sometimes having a 287-foot yacht

504
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,880
just isn't enough to warn people
you're a douchebag.

505
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,680
And Rand's influence
extends even further.

506
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,920
Ayn Rand, more than anyone else,
did a fantastic job

507
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,840
of explaining
the morality of capitalism.

508
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,840
I am a big fan of Ayn Rand.
I've read all of her novels.

509
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,920
Let me encourage any of you who
have not read "Atlas Shrugged"

510
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,600
to go tomorrow, buy
"Atlas Shrugged," and read it.

511
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,240
MALE ANNOUNCER: However,
Ayn Rand is an unlikely hero

512
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,400
for conservatives because
she was also pro-choice...

513
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,280
and anti-God.

514
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,160
No, no that one, the real God...

515
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,040
and in case that's making you
start to fall for her,

516
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,040
take a listen to her views
on Native Americans.

517
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,160
Why would conservatives hold up
as their idol

518
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,280
someone who says things
like that,

519
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,680
especially when there are
so many other advocates

520
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,720
for selfishness
they could choose,

521
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,560
like Donald Trump...

522
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,240
TRUMP: Part of the beauty of me
is that I'm very rich.

523
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,840
MALE ANNOUNCER: or Drake...

524
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,920
I'm'a worry 'bout me,
give a fuck about you

525
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,520
MALE ANNOUNCER: to basically
anyone on Bravo...

526
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,480
I want to

527
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,800
MALE ANNOUNCER: all of which
is enough to make you wonder,

528
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,360
"Ayn Rand, how is she
still a thing?"

529
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,160
And finally--

530
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,160
Finally tonight, Kansas.

531
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,360
It's a land synonymous with me
Googling "Kansas" 20 minutes ago

532
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,720
to see if it's synonymous with anything.

533
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,880
Turns out, mainly wheat

534
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,480
and tornados
that blow away their wheat.

535
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,240
Anyway, Kansas is in a bit of
trouble these days budgetwise.

536
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,240
The State of Kansas is broke,
extremely broke.

537
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,640
Job growth in Kansas lags
behind the rest of the country.

538
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,600
Moody's has downgraded
the state's credit rating,

539
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,000
and the state supreme court
recently ruled that Kansas

540
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,080
had been unconstitutionally
underfunding its schools.

541
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,920
OK. That's horrible.

542
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,040
Children in Kansas
should not be deprived

543
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,800
of a quality education
because of budget shortfalls.

544
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,640
They should be deprived because
of the strict, unyielding

545
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,400
religious beliefs
of their school boards.

546
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,800
That's the Kansas way.

547
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,520
But luckily--

548
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,600
Luckily, the State of Kansas
may actually have

549
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,960
a little cash coming its way
from an unexpected source.

550
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,000
The State of Kansas
soon going

551
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,360
to start profiting
from porn.

552
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,080
Yes, Kansas porn. Finally.

553
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,560
I've got so many ideas
for the titles--

554
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,400
"Little Fuckhouse
on the Prairie,"

555
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,080
"Cornfields Cornholing,"

556
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,920
"Cream of Wheat,"
or maybe you go

557
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,800
the whole "Wizard of Oz" thing

558
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,040
and "Swallow
the Yellow Dick's Load."

559
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,960
Yes. I'm good at this.
I'm good at this.

560
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,960
Now, just out of interest,

561
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,840
how, exactly, is Kansas
in the porn business?

562
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,080
MALE REPORTER:
Hundreds of adult toys

563
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,880
are sitting in this
Kansas City warehouse.

564
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,920
They are up for auction online.

565
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,360
The owner of a string
of adult stores

566
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,240
in that state
didn't pay his taxes.

567
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,800
He owes the state
about $160,000.

568
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,560
The state said he could still
sell his merchandise

569
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,280
to pay off his debt.

570
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,760
OK. So Kansas is only
in the porn business

571
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,920
because the owner of this chain
of sex toy stores,

572
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,880
the Bang chain,
didn't pay his taxes,

573
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,440
and I've got to say,
even by sex toy store standards,

574
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,920
that is one seedy-looking
establishment,

575
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,800
and also, there are some
incredible bargains

576
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,400
for sale at this auction,

577
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,560
like this Icicles brand
transparent penis,

578
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,280
described as not just "elegant,
upscale, and hand-crafted,"

579
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,920
but also "hand-blown,"
which is, incidentally,

580
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,880
the single classiest euphemism
I can possibly think of

581
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,000
for masturbation.

582
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,880
Or you could also get this pair
of "Fifty Shades of Grey"

583
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,960
"You are mine"
metal handcuffs,

584
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,520
which you are, frankly,
going to need

585
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,920
to resuscitate your love life

586
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,640
after the "Fifty Shades" movie
kills your sex drive.

587
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,720
Jamie Dornan
is not my Christian,

588
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,000
#notmychristian.

589
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,240
Now, in fact--

590
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,720
In fact, if I may address
our viewers in Kansas right now,

591
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,960
there is only one problem
with this auction,

592
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,640
and that is that
the current bids

593
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,000
only total $38,000,
and yet you are owed

594
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,600
over 160,000 in taxes.

595
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,440
So you need to start
thinking about this

596
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,160
like a charity auction
and overpay for things that

597
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,920
you clearly do not really need,
and do not give me the whole,

598
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,080
"But, John, I don't need
a Dr. Laura Berman brand

599
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,960
"remote control panty pleaser.

600
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,480
I already have 3."

601
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,000
That's not the point, Kansas.

602
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,720
You're not
buying it for yourself.

603
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,880
You're buying it
to cover your state's

604
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,200
gigantic projected
budget shortfall.

605
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,080
Bidding is open
until Tuesday night

606
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,840
at this website, Kansas,
and you need to raise

607
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,960
around $160,000, and, crucially,
absolutely no more than that

608
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,080
because any excess will,
unfortunately, go straight back

609
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,720
to the tax-delinquent owner
of the sketchiest

610
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,920
sex toy business on the planet.

611
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,640
So let's do this, Kansas.

612
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,280
I want you to go
and comically overspend

613
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,440
on this Raging Hard-On
18-inch double dong,

614
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,720
and I want you to put this
on your shelf,

615
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,560
and I want you to look at it
every day,

616
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,960
and I want you to feel good
about yourself when you do it

617
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,200
because you inadvertently
just helped fund

618
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,640
K-through-12 education
all across the state,

619
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,720
all across
the state.

620
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,080
In fact, every time someone
comes over to your house,

621
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,880
I want you to take this
off the shelf

622
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,160
and frantically wave it around
and tell them what you did.

623
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,120
Do it, Kansas, because
while your state legislature

624
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,960
has fucked you into this mess,
this is your chance

625
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,760
to go online
and fuck yourselves out of it.

626
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,560
That's our show.
Have a great week.

627
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,560
Join us again next Sunday.
Good night.
