1
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,640
Welcome, welcome, welcome! To "Last Week Tonight."

2
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,400
I'm John Oliver. Thanks for being with us.

3
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,360
Very excited. Let's get into it.

4
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,160
Quick roundup of the week. Let's start with Iraq,

5
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,880
where things went from worse to worser.

6
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,760
4 towns on the highway between the Syrian border and Baghdad

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,560
fell yesterday to ISIS.

8
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,760
That is the Sunni militant group, an offshoot of Al Qaeda,

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,280
that is wreaking havoc in the country.

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,920
OK, well, that settles it.

11
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,800
The Iraq-Syria border just earned the title of

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,800
"Scariest place in
the entire world."

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,240
You had a good run,
Kevin Spacey's sex dungeon.

14
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,600
The White House
announced this week

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,680
that we will be
sending some support.

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,760
Although they made one thing
almost overly clear.

17
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,240
They are not being sent
to participate in combat.

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,520
Their role is not
combat mission.

19
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,800
This is not a combat mission.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,520
This is not
a combat mission.

21
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,160
It is not a combat mission.

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,520
This is not
a combat mission.

23
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,960
The president was
crystal clear--

24
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,040
this is not a combat mission.

25
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,440
Be careful.
If you say,

26
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,440
"This is not a combat mission"
5 times into a mirror,

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,760
30,000 troops appear
spontaneously in Baghdad.

28
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,920
Be careful.

29
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,840
So, who exactly are we sending
on this non-combat mission?

30
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,320
More United States forces
are heading to Iraq.

31
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,240
President Obama
plans to send up to

32
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,080
300 military advisors
to the country.

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,800
300 military advisors.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,840
Please don't tell me
that that is

35
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,800
the next installment
in the "300" franchise.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,200
Spartans, prepare for glory!

37
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,960
And remember--we are
here purely

38
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,240
in a non-combat
advisory capacity!

39
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,360
Tonight, we dine in--the hotel!

40
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,960
Meanwhile this week,
in Thailand,

41
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,640
they're still reeling from
last month's military coup,

42
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,960
which was followed by
curfews and clampdowns

43
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,280
on freedom of speech.

44
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,800
However, the general who led
the coup has promised to create,

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,960
and I quote, a "genuine
democracy" in Thailand.

46
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,240
Which sounds nice.

47
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,600
But something about this photo

48
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,480
doesn't exactly scream
"genuine democracy" to me.

49
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,440
I'm telling you,
just add Kyle MacLachlan

50
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,920
and a tiny dancing man
in a red suit,

51
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,880
you've got yourself an actual
David Lynch movie.

52
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,440
Since then, the general has
tried to put a friendlier face

53
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,880
on that dystopian nightmare by
launching--and this is true--

54
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,280
a "happiness campaign."

55
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,120
And what makes people happier than free stuff?

56
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,480
Free broadcasts of all
64 World Cup games.

57
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,560
They're also giving away
movie tickets,

58
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,520
throwing free concerts
in Bangkok

59
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,840
with singing soldiers
and scantily clad women,

60
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,000
and even brought horses
with bales of hay downtown

61
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,800
for people to pet.

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,320
Well, if they think people
are that easy to manipulate,

63
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,960
they are right.

64
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,920
"Look, I can't vote or express
dissent, but look at him!

65
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,920
"He's so soft!

66
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,880
I'm going to name him
Huckleberry!"

67
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,560
Huckleberry the horsey.

68
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,880
And if that doesn't work,
the general still has

69
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,360
one amazing final trick
up his sleeve.

70
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,760
MALE ANNOUNCER: The army
chief general Prayuth Chan-Ocha

71
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,520
wants to return happiness
to Thailand.

72
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:59,160
So much so that he wrote
a ballad about it.

73
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,840
Oh, general, you didn't need to

74
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,760
win them over
with power ballads.

75
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,840
You had them at
"Do not leave your homes

76
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,880
after 10:00 p.m. at night."

77
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,680
And finally tonight,
let's talk about Antarctica.

78
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,560
I'm afraid it's been
a week of bad news.

79
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,560
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: New research
from Australian scientists says

80
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,960
tourists are threatening
the Antarctic biodiversity

81
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,920
with pollution
and physical disturbances.

82
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,840
SECOND FEMALE ANNOUNCER: More
than 40,000 people actually

83
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,000
visit Antarctica
every single year,

84
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,080
and scientists say even
walking on moss beds

85
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,720
will leave footprints that
could last for centuries.

86
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,520
Look, I know this isn't how
I'm supposed to react to that,

87
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,720
but that really makes me want to
walk on an Antarctic moss bed.

88
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,040
Which is why Antarctica
is in serious trouble.

89
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,320
Environmental destruction
is not enough

90
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,280
to stop the tide of
tourists and morning shows

91
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,800
desperate for unusual
travel segment filler.

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,120
You may not think of Antarctica
as a vacation destination,

93
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,720
but apparently that's changing.

94
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,000
MALE ANNOUNCER: The number-one
reason folks say

95
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,960
they come on tour groups?

96
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,400
To see those human-like
flightless birds, the penguins.

97
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,720
And then they "Mmm'mmm'mm"

98
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,320
and then they cry when they're
hungry "Aahh ahh ahh."

99
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,280
Some of the freshest water
you'll probably ever taste

100
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,840
because it dates back
400,000 years.

101
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,760
What are you doing?

102
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,840
Tragically, the Antarctic ice
shelf is rapidly diminishing.

103
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,840
Now, if you'll excuse me--

104
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,320
So pure. Mmm.
So rare.

105
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,920
That is the problem.

106
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,400
I know we're not supposed
to go to Antarctica,

107
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,960
but there are free penguins
and sno-cones there.

108
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,520
So, they're going to
have to launch

109
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,800
a pretty strong
anti-tourist campaign,

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
or we'll do it for them.

111
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,560
MALE ANNOUNCER: Antarctica,
the majestic seventh continent.

112
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,800
An unspoiled land of
incredible ice formations

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,960
that you simply have to see.

114
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,360
And seeing as how you're
looking at them right now,

115
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,280
you've technically seen them.

116
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,920
So, don't come here.

117
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,840
Seriously, you want to feel
the bracing cold on your skin?

118
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,800
Stick your dick in a freezer.

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,520
You want to see
a seal up close?

120
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,080
Here. Here's a seal up close.

121
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,280
Now here's a seal in HD.
Now it's in 3-D.

122
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,520
It's like you're actually here,
which, hopefully, you're not.

123
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,240
Our point is you don't
need to come here.

124
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,000
Want to impress your friends
by going someplace exotic?

125
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,880
How about Belgium.

126
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,760
Have your friends
been to Belgium? No?

127
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,720
Then it's exotic to them.

128
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,200
And if you simply have to have
ice, go to Alaska and tell them

129
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,800
you went to Antarctica.

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,840
They won't know the difference.

131
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,240
Hey, guess which
of these is Alaska?

132
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,160
You don't know, do you?
It's both of them.

133
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,400
We don't care where
in the world you go,

134
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,320
just so long as it's in this
general area and not here.

135
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
Gotta go.
You have to visit.

136
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,920
Let's move on.

137
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,880
Look, let's deal with the
elephant in the room tonight.

138
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,640
I'm sorry that "Game of Thrones"
is not on anymore.

139
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,320
But I may be able to help you
with your withdrawal,

140
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,880
because recently there was
some real-life royal news.

141
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,480
The king of Spain, Juan Carlos,
has announced he's abdicating

142
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,880
after nearly 40 years in power.

143
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,800
See? Who's missing
"Game of Thrones" now, huh?

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,880
Who needs decapitations
or poisonings

145
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,960
when you've got a 76-year-old
man peacefully resigning?

146
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,840
I will say, I am totally
against abdications.

147
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,640
No tour guide should
ever be able to say,

148
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,800
"Here is where our
ex-king lives,"

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,480
and point to
a one-bedroom apartment.

150
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,840
There is a place where ex-kings
are supposed to go

151
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,600
and it's called the ground.

152
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,120
The problem was that public
opinion had turned against

153
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,440
King Juan Carlos for
his lavish lifestyle

154
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,400
in the midst of
Spain's recession.

155
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,520
Which meant that his son's
coronation this week

156
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,920
was a bit underwhelming.

157
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,880
MALE ANNOUNCER: As coronations
go, this one was a deliberate

158
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,520
bargain basement job.

159
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,120
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: King Felipe VI
received the red sash

160
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,600
of the captain general
of the armed forces

161
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,680
from his father Juan Carlos.

162
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,720
That's it?

163
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,600
You didn't even get a crown?

164
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,400
Just a red fucking sash
that your daddy put on you?

165
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,160
What are you, the king of Spain,

166
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,520
or a kid who just got
a new belt in karate class?

167
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,000
And you call this
a royal parade?

168
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,240
You're just taking
an Uber around the city.

169
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,840
Let me show you something.
This is a parade.

170
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,360
This is what happened
in Los Angeles this week

171
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,520
to celebrate their hockey team
winning the Stanley Cup.

172
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,840
That's right.
The L.A. Kings

173
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,440
had a bigger parade than
the actual Spanish king.

174
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,200
And L.A. doesn't give
a shit about hockey.

175
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,960
But all this raises
a much bigger question--

176
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,480
why does any country
still have royalty at all?

177
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,640
There are currently
26 royal families

178
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,600
reigning in 43 countries.

179
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,920
That's 43 countries
where asking,

180
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,800
"Who died and made you king?"

181
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,840
is an entirely
legitimate question.

182
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,200
Don't get me wrong.
At one point,

183
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,440
monarchies did serve a genuine
historical purpose.

184
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,080
Kings and queens
were all-powerful.

185
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,200
They either led their countries
into battle on horses

186
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,560
or kept the peace by being
strategically married off

187
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,440
to other royal families.

188
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,440
"Let us commemorate this treaty
by having our children fuck."

189
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,920
"Can we still invade Italy?"

190
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,720
"I'll just check
the family tree.

191
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,840
"No, I'm afraid not.

192
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,880
Our cousins are banging
their cousins."

193
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,680
And if you want
modern proof of this,

194
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,920
just look at who
was in the room

195
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,800
at the recent
British royal wedding.

196
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,400
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: After centuries of
continental coupling,

197
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,160
many of Europe's royals
are related by blood

198
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,880
to the British crown.

199
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,880
There's a lot of cousins, and
they probably don't even know

200
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,880
who's related to who.

201
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,240
The gene pool, the gene pool of
European royalty is so small,

202
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,120
the only difference between
that and an Alabama wedding

203
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,240
are the amount of paper plates at the reception

204
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,200
and how drunk the violin player
is going to be.

205
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,120
Now, to be fair, some of
the current 26 monarchies

206
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,640
still have that
old-school flavor.

207
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,920
And if you want some modern-day
"Game of Thrones" shit,

208
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,200
you have got to head
to the Middle East,

209
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,640
where some royal families have
virtually unchecked power,

210
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,440
and they act like it.

211
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,840
A few years back, a member of

212
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,880
the United Arab Emirates
royal family

213
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,520
was charged with
a horrifying crime.

214
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,080
On the videotape
that was released

215
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,440
by a business associate
of Sheikh Issa,

216
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,720
you can see Sheikh Issa
and others torturing this man.

217
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,800
He's been acquitted
despite 5 other people

218
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,920
who are also charged over this
being found guilty.

219
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,600
Yeah, because
unfortunately for them,

220
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,320
the judge found them guilty
not just of that

221
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,240
but the much larger
crime of not being

222
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,520
a member of
the royal family there.

223
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,280
And sure, that's just
one rogue family member.

224
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,440
But that's the key drawback
of inherited power--

225
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,920
having a monarchy means
the fate of your country

226
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,880
is basically a genetic lottery.

227
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,760
Because every family
has the one fuckup

228
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,520
they talk about
behind their backs.

229
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,640
And if you're thinking,
"My family doesn't,"

230
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,320
then I'm afraid it's you.

231
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,680
I'm sorry about that.

232
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,000
But sooner or later,
every country

233
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,320
loses a round of
royal roulette.

234
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,560
Now, remember the military coup
in Thailand

235
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,920
at the start of the show?

236
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,920
That's happening, at least
in part, because Thailand

237
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,160
loves their current king.

238
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,760
The problem is, he's near
the end of his life,

239
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,160
and his son is an idiot.

240
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,960
MALE ANNOUNCER: He is enormously
unpopular within the country.

241
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,120
The crown prince is considered
a bit of a buffoon.

242
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,080
That's right: Thailand actually
has a buffoonish crown prince.

243
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,600
And I understand why
the Thai people are upset,

244
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,240
because they have a law where
you can get 15 years in jail

245
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,680
for insulting the monarchy.

246
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,640
And yet they have a prince who
featured in--and this is true--

247
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,120
a video of a birthday party
he threw for his dog,

248
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,840
a miniature poodle
called Foo Foo,

249
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,720
in which his topless wife served the dog birthday cake.

250
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,760
And you're telling me they're

251
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,560
not supposed to
make fun of that?

252
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,800
That's entrapment.

253
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,440
That's not fair.

254
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,360
You ask too much.

255
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,800
And I'll be honest.
I'll be honest.

256
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,600
Seeing stories like that
is enough to make me glad

257
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,840
that the queen of England
is mostly decorative now.

258
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,360
In fact, the most relevant thing
she's done recently

259
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,880
was announce that this week,
she's going to visit

260
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,000
the "Game of Thrones" set.

261
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,680
The queen of England
is heading to Westeros.

262
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,320
The British monarch will visit
the Belfast set next week

263
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,920
during her tour of
Northern Ireland.

264
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,880
We're all waiting for a shot of
her sitting in the iron throne.

265
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,800
Oh, you don't need to wait.

266
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,800
Here. There she is.
There.

267
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,720
There she is right now,

268
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,040
embodying the harsh irony
that is her existence.

269
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,320
Because at that moment
next week,

270
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,920
she will be a queen with fake
power, visiting a fake kingdom,

271
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,280
which arguably has more impact
on the lives of her countrymen

272
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,440
than she does.

273
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,960
And now this.

274
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,640
I'm not a doctor.
I'm not a psychologist.

275
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,920
I'm not
a psychiatrist.

276
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,920
I'm not
a psychologist.

277
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,440
I'm not a security professional.

278
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,560
I'm not
a drape measurer.

279
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,560
I'm not a witch.

280
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,800
I'm not a scientist.

281
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,960
I'm not a scientist
but I'm an optometrist.

282
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,280
I am not a
politician by trade.

283
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,560
I'm not a control freak.

284
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,960
I'm not a Ron Paul Republican.

285
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,200
I'm not a dingo.

286
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,400
Well, I'm not a repairman.

287
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,560
I'm not a doom and gloom person.

288
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,160
I am not an empty dress,
I am not a rubber stamp,

289
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,520
and I am not a cheerleader!

290
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,880
Now, finally, finally tonight,

291
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,920
I would like to talk
about doctors.

292
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,880
They're among our most
trusted professionals.

293
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,640
Nearly 70% of us rate them
highly on ethical standards.

294
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,320
Our lives and occasionally
our balls are in their hands.

295
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,240
Which is why it was especially
troubling last week to see this.

296
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,760
With his syndicated TV show,
magazine, and web site,

297
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,400
Dr. Oz has become one of
America's most trusted docs.

298
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,800
But on Capitol Hill Tuesday,
he was on the hot seat.

299
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Excuse me, but any seat Dr. Oz
is sitting on is the hot seat.

300
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,520
Whoo.

301
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,880
Whoo. Whoo.

302
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,160
So, what did the doctor do?

303
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,840
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: They
criticized the talk show host

304
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,680
for describing untested
weight loss supplements

305
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,840
as magical or miraculous.

306
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,520
I want you to write it down--
garcinia cambogia.

307
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,000
Because it may be the simple
solution you've been looking for

308
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,360
to bust your body fat for good.

309
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,880
Now, I've got the number-one
miracle in a bottle

310
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,000
to burn your fat.

311
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,600
Lightning in a bottle.

312
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,480
It's a miracle flower
to fight fat.

313
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,080
Miracle flowers?

314
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,880
Are you a doctor or an Old West
traveling salesman?

315
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,240
"Have I got something miraculous
for you, ladies and gentlemen!

316
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,400
"A monkey's paw mixed with
5 petals of a rose

317
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,040
"and a thimble full of
otter semen!

318
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,200
"Guaranteed to cure
your lumbago.

319
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,200
Step right up.
Step right up here."

320
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,800
The Senate hearing was about

321
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,840
the marketing of
dietary supplements.

322
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,400
And unfortunately, no one is

323
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,200
more effective at that
than Dr. Oz.

324
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,520
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: Oz's advice
is so influential

325
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,560
that one mention of a product
can cause sales to skyrocket.

326
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,280
The phenomenon even has its
own name--the Dr. Oz effect.

327
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,640
After Dr. Oz touted
a substance called

328
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,760
green coffee bean extract,

329
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,920
one company in Florida
sold half a million bottles.

330
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,760
Well, what's so wrong with that?

331
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,680
Name me one case where a man
named Oz claimed mystical powers

332
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,520
and led people horribly astray.

333
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,880
Name me one case.
You can't do it.

334
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,600
The only problem with
the "Dr. Oz effect"

335
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,840
is that magic pills don't
technically exist,

336
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,280
and Dr. Oz knows that.

337
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,040
MAN: Do you believe that there's a miracle
pill out there?

338
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,840
There's not a pill that's
going to help you long term,

339
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,800
lose weight, live the best life
without diet and exercise.

340
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,800
MAN: Do you believe
there's a magic

341
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,440
weight-loss cure
out there?

342
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,520
The word--if you're
selling something

343
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,800
because it's magical, no.

344
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,320
Well, what?

345
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,720
That would be ridiculous.

346
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,200
No one is claiming there's
a magic pill out there.

347
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,960
That would be stupid.

348
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,680
This little bean
has scientists saying

349
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,360
they've found the magic
weight-loss cure

350
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,160
for every body type.

351
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,640
See? He never said
there was a magic pill.

352
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,920
He said there was a magic bean!

353
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,760
That's clearly entirely
different, because magic beans

354
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,840
are a very real thing
that you trade your cow for

355
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,560
so you can steal a golden
harp from a giant!

356
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,960
That's science.

357
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,480
And by the way,
a recent study found

358
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,480
the main ingredient
in those magic beans

359
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,880
not only fails to help lab mice,

360
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,400
it gave them the early
symptoms of diabetes.

361
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,800
Though if you're a lab mouse
with diabetes, you got off easy.

362
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,840
Good luck getting any sympathy
in the lab mouse support group.

363
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,920
"Oh, I'm sorry you
can't have any candy.

364
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,520
"I've got an ear growing
out of my fucking back!

365
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,840
Jeff's got herpes.
Sorry, Jeff."

366
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,320
Here's the issue--
Dr. Oz is a doctor.

367
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,320
And one with degrees from
two Ivy League schools.

368
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,960
He's also dangerously likable.

369
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,960
Watch how "Morning Joe" reacted

370
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,840
after seeing bits of his
congressional testimony.

371
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,400
I only bought them once.
It didn't work.

372
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,840
WOMAN: Did you buy them because you saw them
on "Dr. Oz"?

373
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,320
I like Dr. Oz, OK?
So--

374
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,880
I like him a lot.

375
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,320
And he's come here
with really good advice.

376
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,960
He has great advice.

377
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,840
And listen, if he's got magic
coffee beans,

378
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,920
I want some of that. WOMAN: Me, too.

379
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,960
You just showed a report
that implied they didn't work!

380
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,520
You basically just did an
"Emperor's New Clothes" piece

381
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,640
and then ended it by saying,
"By the way, the emperor's

382
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,440
"tailor was incredible.

383
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,760
That guy can stitch."

384
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,840
And to give Dr. Oz the benefit
of overwhelming medical doubt,

385
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,920
he seems to be standing by some of his claims.

386
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,960
I actually do personally
believe in the items

387
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,040
that I talk about on the show.

388
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,760
I passionately study them.

389
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,840
I recognize that oftentimes they
don't have the scientific muster

390
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,000
to present as fact.

391
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,600
But that's the whole point.

392
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,080
You're presenting it
as a doctor.

393
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,200
If you want to keep spouting
this bullshit, that's fine,

394
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,680
but don't call your show
"Dr. Oz."

395
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:30,600
Call it "Check This Shit Out
with Some Guy Named Mehmet."

396
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,800
The problem is--it's
a good title, to be fair.

397
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,640
The problem is
this Senate hearing

398
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,680
is going to achieve nothing,
for a very chilling reason.

399
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,800
Beyond embarrassing Dr. Oz,

400
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,680
there's very little that
Congress can do in this arena.

401
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,960
It is the Federal
Trade Commission's job

402
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,720
to go after online scams
and even they, Gayle,

403
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
can only scratch the surface.

404
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,680
She's right.
Dr. Oz

405
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,480
is just a symptom
of the problem.

406
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,560
The disease is the fact that
dietary supplements in the U.S.

407
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,600
are shockingly unregulated.

408
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,840
There are two agencies who
theoretically oversee things,

409
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,080
the FTC and the FDA.

410
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,360
The FTC is
supposed to regulate

411
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,160
the marketing of supplements.

412
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,600
But by their own
admission, they give

413
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,320
great deference to the FDA

414
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,480
on whether a company's
health claim can be supported.

415
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,920
The problem with that is
the FDA has little authority

416
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,760
to investigate the contents
of supplements until

417
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,840
people are already
getting sick from them.

418
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,680
That sounds crazy,
and in the past,

419
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,560
they actually tried
to change this.

420
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,200
In the late 1980s,
38 people died

421
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,160
from L-tryptophan supplements,
and in response, the FDA

422
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,320
tried to expand its authority.

423
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,920
How did that go?

424
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,560
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: In 1993,
the industry struck back.

425
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,520
Consumers were urged to write
to their congressman

426
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,480
or told they may have to kiss
their Vitamin C goodbye.

427
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,480
So, did people write
to their congressman?

428
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,440
More people wrote to Congress about the supplement bill

429
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,680
than wrote about
the Vietnam War.

430
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,760
What?

431
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,920
How good must the pro-vitamin
protest songs have been?

432
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,920
Ginseng!

433
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,920
Huh!

434
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,560
What is it good for?

435
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,520
Sexual dysfunction
and Type 2 diabetes

436
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,800
Say it again, y'all!

437
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,800
Say it again

438
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Actually, there were
actually no protest songs,

439
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,920
but there were PSAs put out
by the supplement industry

440
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,520
featuring not just
jackbooted thugs

441
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,560
coming to take your vitamins,

442
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,520
but a surprise celebrity cameo.

443
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,520
MAN: Freeze!

444
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,840
Hey, guys, guys,

445
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,040
it's only vitamins.

446
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,080
Oh, 1993 was a different time.

447
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,160
When you could plausibly say,
"Hey, be quiet, everybody.

448
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,040
Let's all listen to what
Mel Gibson has to say."

449
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,920
And the supplement industry
didn't just pay for ads.

450
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,640
They gave money to lawmakers

451
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,600
like Republican Senator
Orrin Hatch

452
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,600
and Democratic Senator
Tom Harkin.

453
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,240
This was them back then.

454
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,880
They actually became
the two top recipients

455
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,440
of funds from the industry,

456
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,560
and, in a crazy coincidence,

457
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,040
they co-sponsored a bill
to deregulate it.

458
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,680
I send to the desk
a substitute amendment

459
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,920
on behalf of Senators
Hatch and Harkin.

460
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,800
Today we honor the wishes
of 100 million people,

461
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,960
consumers of
dietary supplements.

462
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,600
People who simply
want the ability

463
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,880
to lead healthy lifestyles

464
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,800
without the
constant intervention

465
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,160
of one tiny agency
which is possessed by

466
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,000
a regulatory zeal
equaling none.

467
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,680
"Regulatory zeal"?

468
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,200
He just criticized
a regulatory agency

469
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,080
for being too into
regulating things.

470
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,760
That's like accusing
your podiatrist

471
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,720
of having a foot fetish.

472
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,960
"Dude, dude, dude,
you're obsessed with feet.

473
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,920
Just tone it down a bit."

474
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,560
Now, the supplement industry
will claim that it is

475
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,240
"one of the more highly
regulated industries."

476
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,480
See how true you think that is.

477
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,240
Because if you're a supplement
company today,

478
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,800
you do not need approval
from the FDA

479
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,520
before a product is marketed,

480
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,840
you can make health claims

481
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,240
without prior approval
from the government,

482
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,880
and you don't have to prove
the safety or effectiveness

483
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,560
of your product before
putting it up for sale.

484
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,440
The industry is essentially
supposed to police itself.

485
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,200
That's like one of
those porn sites

486
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,360
that asks you to enter
your own age.

487
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,320
Which basically just ends up
teaching children

488
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,360
how to subtract 18
from the current year.

489
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,880
It doesn't work.

490
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,920
Which may explain why, since
1994, the supplement industry

491
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,200
has gone from making $4 billion
to $32 billion a year.

492
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,240
With almost no side effects.

493
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,840
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: People who consume
tainted dietary supplements

494
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,000
have suffered from negative side
effects like severe bleeding,

495
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,280
strokes, liver damage,
or even death.

496
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,040
MALE ANNOUNCER: Health officials
say the common item

497
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,600
linked to several recent cases
of acute liver failure in Hawaii

498
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,240
is OxyElite Pro.

499
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,960
FEMALE ANNOUNCER:
Orioles pitcher Steve Bechler,

500
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,440
who died after taking Ephedra

501
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,960
during last spring training.

502
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,680
Ephedra stayed on the market
an extra two years

503
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,160
after many experts
asked for a ban.

504
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,960
Meantime, the number of deaths
rose to 155,

505
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,320
with 16,000 adverse events.

506
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,440
Wow, that's enough to make you
wish for an agency

507
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,320
with a certain amount of,
oh, what's the phrase?

508
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,880
Regulatory zeal.

509
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,080
And yet lawmakers still
resist regulation.

510
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,680
Because when, two years ago,
a bill was proposed suggesting

511
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,000
supplements should carry
warning labels about

512
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,960
potentially dangerous
side effects,

513
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,360
you'll never guess
who popped up again.

514
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,480
The FDA already has
a tremendous amount of

515
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,640
regulatory oversight
and enforcement tools

516
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,400
when it comes to
dietary supplements.

517
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,880
Every supplement has a label,

518
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,760
has the ingredients
and the potency, by law,

519
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,880
on every single item that is
sold as a supplement.

520
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,880
That's right--Hatch and Harkin,

521
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,800
who in 2012 had
retained their title

522
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,240
of the top two recipients
of campaign funds

523
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,480
from the supplement industry.

524
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,520
See? Two decades later,

525
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,360
those campaign contributions,
still working.

526
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:22,720
Who says nutritional supplements
don't have long-lasting effects?

527
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,040
And by the way, on the point
that Senator Harkin made,

528
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,800
about how every supplement has
a label saying what's inside it.

529
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,400
Well, funny story.
When a group of researchers

530
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,320
recently DNA tested supplements

531
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,600
from a dozen
North American companies,

532
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,640
they found that 1/3 contained
no trace whatsoever

533
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,280
of the plant advertised
on the bottle.

534
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,680
If one in 3 milk bottles
didn't contain milk,

535
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,800
you might think twice about
pouring the white mystery liquid

536
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,120
all over your cereal.

537
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,080
But none of this
is likely to change,

538
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,880
because companies have access
to the one genuinely truly

539
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,760
effective wonder drug.

540
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,600
It's called lobbying.

541
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,840
And here's how
the science works.

542
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,840
FDA regulation can really
stop up your profits,

543
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,760
jamming up your whole
money-making system,

544
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,960
which can lead to
painful effects

545
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,840
on the company's bottom line,

546
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,360
but with lobbying's
somehow-legal process,

547
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,800
all those pesky regulations
just melt away into nothingness,

548
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,520
giving you that comfortable
corporate feeling

549
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,840
of shitting money
almost uncontrollably.

550
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,000
Ask your lawyers if
lobbying is right for you.

551
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:39,360
But none of this--none of this
answers the key

552
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,880
Dr. Oz question.

553
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,720
Now, he says he wasn't paid to
mention any particular products.

554
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,440
So, why say those things
on TV at all?

555
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,120
In an intent to engage viewers,
I use flowery language.

556
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,960
I used language that was
very passionate.

557
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,200
That makes sense because
we're all looking for

558
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,440
flowery language from our physicians.

559
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,920
"Like the sunlight shines upon
the hidden grassy meadow,

560
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:09,480
so does Chlamydia cast a warm
glow upon your private parts."

561
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,840
And when he says engaging
viewers, that is the problem.

562
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,680
Perhaps his fatal flaw
is that he's done

563
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,360
870 daily hour-long shows
about health and medicine,

564
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,920
which is impossible.

565
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,880
Sooner or later, you're going to
get tired of doing shows about

566
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,360
what your poop should look like
with Cameron Diaz.

567
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,840
OZ: Does this
ever happen to you?

568
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,960
Luckily, no.

569
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,240
I'm not a girl that
gets constipated.

570
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,480
Good for you.

571
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,280
Lucky you, Diaz.
Lucky you.

572
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,320
And instead of that,
you're going to get tempted

573
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,320
to overstretch and do a show
with a title like

574
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,360
"Can an aspirin a day
keep cancer away?"

575
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,720
to which the answer
is clearly, "No.

576
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,320
Not entirely."

577
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,880
Because I feel like if it did,

578
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,960
we wouldn't be hearing about it
for the first time at 4:00 p.m.

579
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,360
on a Wednesday afternoon.

580
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,920
"Hey, did you hear
that they cured cancer?"

581
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,040
"No, I was watching
Wendy Williams."

582
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,880
And look, the frustrating
thing is,

583
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,800
it's easy to fill a show
with shameless pandering

584
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,120
without dangerously misleading
medical information.

585
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,760
Here. I'll show you.

586
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,040
I'll show you pandering
that you wouldn't believe.

587
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,760
Hey, everyone--
wouldn't it be great

588
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,200
if we had a Skype interview

589
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,000
with George R.R. Martin, the
writer of "Game of Thrones"?

590
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,880
OK. Let's do it.

591
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,960
Hey, George, George,
how's the writing going?

592
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,120
I just killed 3 of your
favorite characters.

593
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,240
What? It's not Arya?

594
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,360
It's not Arya,
is it?

595
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,400
George, it's not Arya.

596
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,840
Please tell me
it's not Arya.

597
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,640
Give me the truth!
Damn you, Martin!

598
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,320
OK, well, people
seemed to like that

599
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,600
and no one got hurt, so,
let's keep pandering.

600
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,560
Everyone likes puppies,
don't they?

601
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,360
Here's a puppy right now!

602
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,960
Here's a puppy.

603
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,200
Hello, puppy.

604
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,040
Hello, puppy.
And look. Look.

605
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,120
Neither I nor the puppy are
making unsubstantiated claims

606
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,760
about potentially harmful
dietary supplements!

607
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,440
You're not doing that,
are you, puppy?

608
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,360
Look. Because you don't need to,
do you, precious?

609
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,920
You don't need to.
And look, look,

610
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,320
here's something else
that people like--

611
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:18,040
women in trashy dresses throwing
wine in each others' faces!

612
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,400
These are--
they love it.

613
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,680
Stop! Calm down,
ladies, calm down.

614
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,040
It's all fabricated.

615
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,720
Let's keep pandering.

616
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,120
Who wants a t-shirt?

617
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,000
Who wants a t-shirt?

618
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,080
Let's pander it up.
Who wants a t-shirt?

619
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,680
Who wants a t-shirt?
Who wants--

620
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,640
People love t-shirts,
they love t-shirts

621
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,360
almost as much as they love
celebrities dancing!

622
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:46,960
And guess what--here's
Steve Buscemi, tap dancing!

623
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,960
Perfect.

624
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,960
Hey, Steve.

625
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,080
Hey.

626
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,920
Hey, Steve...
Steve...

627
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
do you even know
how to tap dance?

628
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,440
Not really.

629
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,360
Hey, Steve,

630
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,680
any thoughts, Steve,

631
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,880
on the questionable
benefits

632
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,640
of dietary supplements?

633
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,760
Oh, John, this isn't
really the time or place

634
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,800
for that discussion.

635
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,880
Exactly!
That's the point!

636
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,880
See, Dr. Oz?
We've done it!

637
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,080
We engaged viewers
without recommending

638
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,680
any unregulated products

639
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,360
that could potentially
induce diabetes!

640
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,040
And to celebrate
this pander-fest,

641
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,040
please welcome
the Black and Gold

642
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,600
Marching Elite!

643
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,840
Here they come.

644
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,640
See?
It's the music.

645
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,160
That's our
show tonight.

646
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,920
Our thanks to tap-
dancing Steve Buscemi

647
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,600
and to George
R.R. Martin

648
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,960
and the Black and Gold
Marching Elite!

649
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,000
Have a great week!
Good night!
