00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,600
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight." I am John Oliver.

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,760
And welcome, welcome, welcome to whatever this is.

3
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,040
Let's get started straight away. First, quick recap of the week:

4
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,680
It turned out to be a rough week

5
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,320
for unrepentant racists and recording devices.

6
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,240
The owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, Donald Sterling,

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,800
was caught on audiotape telling his girlfriend

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,480
not to pose for pictures with black people

9
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,800
and not to then bring them
to basketball games.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,840
MAN: Sterling was upset after
she posted an Instagram photo

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,920
of her with Magic Johnson.

12
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,080
Wow. That is
genuinely shocking.

13
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,200
An 80-year-old man
knows about Instagram?

14
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,960
But look, I'm sure he'll
win his way back into

15
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,640
everyone's good graces.

16
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,720
Who can stay mad
at that racist face?

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,920
He's like a walking
"before" photo.

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,040
And impressively, impressively,
this horrific human

19
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,400
actually managed
to somehow one-up

20
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,200
the previous most racist
person of the week,

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,080
Cliven Bundy, who finished
his weeklong seminar

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,880
on the benefits of slavery by
provoking the single greatest

23
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,680
introduction to an interview
in the history of

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,480
the English language.

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,360
Mr. Bundy,
I see in your arms

26
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,320
that you are
holding a dead calf.

27
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,000
"Oh, this old thing?

28
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,480
I hadn't even noticed that I was carrying it."

29
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,080
And just this morning,

30
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,400
Catholics ended the week
with a huge celebration.

31
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,880
WOMAN: Just a short time ago,
Pope Francis presided

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,840
over a double papal canonization
ceremony that elevated

33
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,120
Popes John Paul II
and John XXIII into sainthood.

34
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,080
Two at once!

35
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,960
That's the papal-sainthood
equivalent of

36
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,640
a KFC Double Down.

37
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,920
This morning was actually

38
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,800
historic for
a number of reasons:

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,400
It's an event that
may well never happen again.

40
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,960
In effect, 4 popes in the same
place at the same time.

41
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,480
Pope Francis will declare
that two of his predecessors

42
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,400
are here in spirit as saints

43
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,280
while the man he succeeded,
Benedict XVI, looks on.

44
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,200
You know who I actually
feel bad for there?

45
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,960
Pope Benedict.
Because it cannot be easy

46
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,720
to be the fourth-most-popular
pope in the room,

47
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,640
especially when two of
the other popes are dead.

48
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,600
And finally, there was big Obamacare news this week:

49
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,280
On the positive side, signups
have surpassed 8 million people.

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,560
But unfortunately, on Thursday,
it turned out that

51
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,880
one state in particular
is lagging behind.

52
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,560
Oregon has officially shut down
its online health care exchange

53
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,880
after weeks of trying to fix its
bulky, glitchy system.

54
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,480
Oregon residents will now use
the federal healthcare.gov site

55
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,760
to sign up for
medical insurance.

56
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,800
WOMAN: All told, taxpayers
have coughed up

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,920
a whopping $248 million

58
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,000
for a web site that
still doesn't work.

59
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,440
Wait, wait, wait. OK.

60
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,560
So, let's break
all of that down:

61
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,560
Oregon spent a quarter
of a billion dollars.

62
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,800
And its web site--designed to
sign people up in one sitting--

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,040
did that for exactly nobody.

64
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,000
And they're now handing the keys
over to healthcare.gov.

65
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,400
That has got to be a bitter pill to swallow
for the people of Oregon,

66
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,600
or it would be, if they could
get the pill, which they can't,

67
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
because their shitty
web site is broken.

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,800
Now, to be fair...

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,040
to be fair,

70
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,520
to be fair to Oregon,
not all of that money

71
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,720
was spent on
the web site itself.

72
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,680
3 million of it was spent on

73
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,760
violently adorable adverts
like this:

74
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,960
WOMAN:  Long live
our Oregon spirit

75
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,360
Long live the Oregon way

76
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,400
To care for each one,
every daughter and son

77
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,400
Live long, Oregon

78
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,840
Eww!

79
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,400
Look, we get it, Oregon.
You people live in a cartoon!

80
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,960
Your mountains are breathtaking,
your coffee is fair trade,

81
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,200
and everywhere you go you hear
the sound of fucking ukeleles.

82
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,880
You've made your point,
but here's the thing.

83
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,920
This is all very charming until
you waste tens of millions

84
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,280
of dollars of taxpayer money
on a web site that doesn't work.

85
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,160
Luckily, we here
have prepared something

86
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,960
to convey that message
to you in a way

87
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,360
that I think you'll
be able to understand.

88
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,400
Like artists in Portland,
your site doesn't work

89
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,480
That 404 Error
is not just a quirk

90
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,200
You blew all our money
on these stupid sets

91
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,400
So when you break your leg,
try the neighborhood vet

92
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,400
You stupid Oregon idiots

93
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,400
You human
Pinterest boards

94
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,000
Your passion for cuteness
might kill your whole state

95
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,400
So long, Oregon

96
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,800
That's right. That's right.
That's right.

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,800
We flew in
Lisa Loeb to tell you

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,120
to go fuck yourselves, Oregon.

99
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,280
But, look, let's move on

100
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,320
and let's talk about
election news.

101
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,960
And before you say it,
no, I do not mean this:

102
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,440
How is the 2016 field
shaping up?

103
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,920
The prospects
of Hillary Clinton...

104
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,240
Vice President Joe Biden...

105
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,600
Chris Christie
leading the way...

106
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,240
Maybe it can actually
be Jeb Bush.

107
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,000
Rand Paul is one of
the leading frontrunners.

108
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,880
Ted Cruz,
even Donald Trump.

109
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,600
MAN: Could he be testing the
presidential waters again?

110
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,960
I've got an even more important
question: Who gives a shit?

111
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,800
Because here's the frustrating thing: Cable
news does not need to be

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,720
focusing on an election
that's happening in 926 days

113
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,800
when there's an important one
happening right now

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,840
that they're all
completely ignoring.

115
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,680
The world's biggest election
is underway in India.

116
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,800
It's the biggest
election on the planet.

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,320
814 million voters
eligible to vote.

118
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,960
Yes, the biggest
election in human history

119
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,400
is taking place
in India right now.

120
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,480
Nearly 1/5 of the world's working-age population
lives there.

121
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,800
It has a direct economic
impact on America.

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,640
And yet, this is the most substantive conversation
about it we could find:

123
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,480
We're going to get questions
from some writers to the program

124
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,600
saying what are you talking
about India for?

125
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,760
What does that have to do
with the United States?

126
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,400
850 million voters.
WOMAN: Right.

127
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,120
Why should that concern us? They're not even
in our hemisphere.

128
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,320
Yeah! Yeah! They're not
even in our hemisphere,

129
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,880
And if they're not, they
basically don't exist.

130
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,320
See? Look! They're not
even on my globe!

131
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,240
They're not on my globe!

132
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,400
Show me where they are!
You can't, can you, boy?

133
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,000
But, look, at least
the guy from Six Flags

134
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,800
is actually talking
about this story.

135
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,960
Because the Indian election
is not even that complicated.

136
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,960
Just like in American elections,
all it really comes down to

137
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,440
is two people.

138
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,800
There are two key people
fighting this out.

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,360
Rahul Gandhi
from the Congress Party

140
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,760
and Narendra Modi from the BJP.

141
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,800
OK, great. So, let's deal
with Gandhi first.

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,800
And I realize it's not the first time that
sentence has been said ,

143
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,880
in a British accent.

144
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,800
Put that aside, put that aside,
put that aside. 1

145
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,760
There's no time, no time.

146
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,400
Rahul Gandhi, however, is--
wow, that guy is handsome.

147
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,000
Look at that vest.
He's like an Indian Han Solo.

148
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,360
This guy is the total
political package.

149
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,200
He's got good looks, he's from a family with 3
former prime ministers.

150
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,000
He's got that vest.

151
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,040
With those 3 credentials, you'd
think he'd have this thing

152
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
completely locked up by now.

153
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,840
But in the kind of twist
worthy of

154
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,920
at least a modicum of
cable news coverage,

155
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,040
he's actually widely expected to lose the
election to this guy.

156
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,720
WOMAN: Narendra Modi is a leader of India's
Hindu Nationalist Party.

157
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,800
MAN: There's a growing
wave of support behind

158
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,800
Narendra Modi,
a hard man politician

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,800
who's worked his way up
from the bottom.

160
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,960
As a boy, he sold tea
on a railway station.

161
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,240
Modi sold tea
in a railway station,

162
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,960
and now he's the most popular
man in the country!

163
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,880
Don't pretend you're not
interested in this, America.

164
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,440
The last time you heard
a rags-to-riches story

165
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,840
about a tea-selling Indian kid,
you threw a fucking Oscar at it.

166
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,520
And you loved that more than

167
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,360
"The Curious Case
of Benjamin Button"!

168
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,040
C'mon, he starts as an old man
and he ends as a dead baby!

169
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,280
It's a heartwarming tale!

170
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,800
Watch it again!
Watch it again!

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,320
That's not the point.

172
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,040
The point is, Modi has
managed to inspire people

173
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,680
with his populist platform,

174
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,480
including a pledge to put
toilets in every home.

175
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,880
Wow, that's a bold move,
coming out as pro-toilet!

176
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,840
Finally, someone's
taking on the powerful

177
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,080
hastily-dug-ditch-in-a-field
lobby.

178
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,320
This is both funny
and also incredibly important

179
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,200
as a public-health issue.

180
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,120
And if that wasn't enough,
in a move that I cannot believe

181
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,880
no American politician
has tried:

182
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,200
Modi has been making campaign
appearances via hologram.

183
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,800
That's right: Modi has gone
Tupac at Coachella!

184
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And that's--that is
how you convince...

185
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,880
that is how you convince
undecided voters.

186
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,960
"So, who are you
gonna vote for?"

187
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,480
"Modi!" "Why?"

188
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,560
"'Cause he appeared
to me as a hologram

189
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,920
and told me he'd
give me a toilet."

190
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,200
That's not just
how you get elected,

191
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,920
that's how religions
get started.

192
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,160
And I can feel the news saying,
"Well, that's all well and good.

193
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,800
"But where's
the scandal here?

194
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,800
Where's the
je ne sais genocide?"

195
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,920
Well, don't worry.
Don't worry,

196
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,800
because Modi has
got you covered.

197
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,760
Many believed that he played
a role in the riots between

198
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,440
Hindus and Muslims which killed
thousands back in 2002.

199
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,520
MAN: An explosion of
communal violence

200
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,560
in his home state on Mr. Modi's
watch still casts a shadow.

201
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,640
At least 1,000 people died,
most of them Muslim."

202
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,560
Is that enough
of a scandal for you?

203
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,960
'Cause bear in mind how much
time we spent in this country

204
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,720
covering a story about
a bridge-based traffic jam

205
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,400
in which the worst that happened
to any Muslims involved was that

206
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,400
they were slightly delayed.

207
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,080
We should care
about this story!

208
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,160
If polls are to be believed, we
may be throwing state dinners

209
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,040
for this guy
in the near future.

210
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,480
And it's not just that he arguably failed
to stop a massacre,

211
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,120
it's that if he's sorry at all,
it's for an unexpected reason.

212
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,840
WOMAN: I asked him if he had any regrets
about what had happened

213
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,960
in his state
in that period.

214
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,960
He told me his
greatest regret was that

215
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,560
he didn't manage
the media very well.

216
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,680
Sure. I could've handled
the media better.

217
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,320
I could've somehow spun
the massacre as a positive.

218
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,240
And in hindsight I will say, it
may not have been the best time

219
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,960
to do "Between
Two Ferns," but...

220
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,960
I'm a fan of Zach.
I'm a fan of Zach.

221
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,000
And I thought that's
what people did now.

222
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,520
If this story isn't
worth covering,

223
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,000
then nothing is worth covering.

224
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,160
And I don't mean to suggest
that the American news media

225
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,560
have completely ignored
India this week.

226
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,520
It's just that this is the story that they went with.

227
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,280
WOMAN: Panic in
the streets of India.

228
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,280
A frightened leopard bursting
from the roof of a house.

229
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,440
MAN: A wild scene in India,
when this leopard got loose.

230
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,840
MAN: A leopard springs through
a roof of a home in India.

231
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,400
WOMAN: Not where you'd imagine
a leopard popping out of

232
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,840
a rooftop like that.
It's crazy.

233
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,080
It's not crazy, though!

234
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,840
Leopards are
indigenous to India.

235
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,880
If it was a leopard in Times
Square on New Year's Eve,

236
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,520
yes, that would be crazy,
that would be insane.

237
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,920
You get him, leopard,
you get him.

238
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,840
And it's also worth noting here
that even as our cable news

239
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,640
has been ignoring India,

240
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,880
India has not been
ignoring our cable news.

241
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,680
MAN: You see a lot of
what may be described

242
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,720
as Foxification of
television news.

243
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,520
The model seems to be Fox News
in the United States,

244
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,200
which is famous internationally
for shouting matches.

245
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,200
Congratulations, Fox.

246
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,600
You're famous internationally
for shouting.

247
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,760
By the way, they don't
even get Fox in India.

248
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,400
They just hear them
from across the ocean.

249
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,760
But--no, no, no.
The point is,

250
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,960
slow down, India.
Let's take a progress report.

251
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,640
How exactly close to American
media have you come?

252
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,720
Do you have a ludicrous
number of people

253
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,960
shouting at each other?

254
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,800
MAN: Mr. Carter wants
to say something, yeah.

255
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,800
One second. Mr. Carter.
Let's go back to the beginning.

256
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,920
MAN: Can I talk?
Yes, I want to talk.

257
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,840
OK. That's one,
that's one.

258
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:43,960
But do you have elaborate,
senseless election graphics?

259
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,800
Incidentally, that is
from CNN India.

260
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,120
And a little fact-check: India has just over
800 million voters.

261
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:59,640
So their own graphic is wrong by
the entire population of Brazil.

262
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,800
You truly are a member
of the CNN family.

263
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,960
But let's get back to it.

264
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,520
Do you have
self-righteous anchors

265
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,760
repeating themselves
over and over again?

266
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,800
And how dare you bring
all this--

267
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,800
How dare you say
I take money.

268
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,800
How dare you say
I take money.

269
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,200
How dare you say
I take money.

270
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,760
You provoke--

271
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,040
How dare you say
I take money.

272
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,800
How dare you say
I take money.

273
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,960
No, I--I--

274
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,800
How dare you say
I take money.

275
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,200
How dare you say
I take money.

276
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
You dare--

277
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,880
How dare you say
I take money.

278
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,840
...back to you.

279
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,000
How dare you say
I take money.

280
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,280
How dare you--

281
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,160
You say this to me. How can you say
I take money?

282
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,240
...speaking to people--

283
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,640
How dare you say
I take money, Miss.

284
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,960
Holy shit, they've
stolen our formula!

285
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,400
But you've forgotten
one crucial detail here, India.

286
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,040
'Cause if you really want to
Americanize your media,

287
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,640
there's one last thing
you have to do:

288
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,960
and that is stop covering
the Indian election.

289
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,000
And now this.

290
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,600
ANNOUNCER: And now...

291
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,400
Listen, Russia is a gas station masquerading
as a country.

292
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,400
Russia is a gas station
masquerading as a country.

293
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,080
It's a gas station
masquerading as a country.

294
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,720
Russia is now a gas station
masquerading as a country.

295
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,880
Russia is a gas station
masquerading as a country.

296
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,280
You know, I've said--I thought
it was a pretty good line.

297
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,400
Russia is a gas station
masquerading as a country.

298
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,400
Good joke.
Good joke.

299
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,920
Now, let's move on. If you looked at the Supreme Court
docket this week,

300
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,160
you may have seen
an unusual case name:

301
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,320
Pom Wonderful versus Coca-Cola.

302
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,200
And if you're wondering
why two beverages

303
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,800
are fighting each other in
the highest court in the land,

304
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,920
it's because Pom Wonderful believes that one
of Coke's products

305
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,840
is misleading the public.

306
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,080
It says "pomegranate blueberry"
in big letters on the label,

307
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,840
but this juice is actually
99% apple and grape.

308
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,840
To see how much pomegranate juice is actually
in this Minute Maid,

309
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,800
you need something as small
as an eye dropper.

310
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,560
That's it.

311
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,120
Seriously? Because if that's the standard, you
should really call it

312
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,920
"Minute Maid Pomegranate
and Rat Urine Blend,"

313
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,840
because let's face it, there's a
little rat urine in everything.

314
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,600
Now, you might think that
Pom Wonderful is the hero here,

315
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,840
standing up for truth
in pomegranary.

316
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,840
But be careful, because
in Coke's defense,

317
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,880
they only misled us about
what was in their juice.

318
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,200
For years, Pom Wonderful
has misled us about

319
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,800
what's in pomegranates.

320
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
MAN: The ads make pomegranate juice sound
almost miraculous.

321
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,920
WOMAN: "Pom Wonderful
Pomegranate Juice,"

322
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,440
claims to have
healing superpowers,

323
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,400
helping you to cheat death.

324
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,800
If you know a man that you
care about or you are a man,

325
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,880
make him drink 8 ounces of
pomegranate juice a day,

326
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,880
'cause what it does for
prostate cancer is amazing.

327
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,800
Or really, just give him
a pomegranate enema instead.

328
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,800
Just shove a bottle of
pomegranate juice up his ass

329
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,560
and squeeze it.

330
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,320
You'll be amazed
at the results.

331
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,720
The U.S. Government
will let you say

332
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,000
just about anything
about your products,

333
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,960
but promising immortality
was too much even for them.

334
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,320
MAN: The Federal Trade Commission says the
company's health claims

335
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,560
are, quote, "false
and unsubstantiated"

336
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,600
and based on dubious research.

337
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,440
Which means what this case is actually about
is Pom Wonderful saying,

338
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,240
"Hey! We didn't spend years
misleading people

339
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,600
"about the health benefits
of our snake oil

340
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,320
"for you to come in and lie
about how much snake oil

341
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,920
you have in your product."

342
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,800
And one of Coke's actual
arguments this week,

343
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,400
in the Supreme Court,
is that they're allowed to

344
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
give their product...

345
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,800
An argument that has the characterizing
flavor of bullshit. 2

346
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,800
But incredibly, incredibly, Coke may actually have legal
precedent on its side.

347
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,960
You see, back in 1984,
Kellogg's,

348
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,400
the folks that make candy that
you can mix with milk, decided--

349
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,120
that despite explicit
recommendations not to--

350
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,440
they put a label on
boxes of All-Bran

351
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
implying that it could
ward off cancer,

352
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,400
saying that their right
to do this is...

353
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,560
Which made other companies say,
"We can say what we want? OK!

354
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,360
Let's do exactly that, then."

355
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,960
Which is why Hellmann's
once felt they could put

356
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,600
a "smart choice" label
on their mayonnaise,

357
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,720
and Cocoa Krispies boasted that they can increase
your children's immunity,

358
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,360
which is true only in the sense
that it immunizes them

359
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,840
from "not having diabetes."

360
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:48,120
And it's extremely rare
for companies to be

361
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,400
called to account
for any of this.

362
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,720
For instance, a few years ago,
Kellogg's was forced

363
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,840
to stop airing this ad:

364
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,320
NARRATOR: A clinical study
showed kids who had

365
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,440
a filling breakfast of
Frosted Mini-Wheats cereal

366
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,040
improved their attentiveness
by nearly 20%.

367
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,640
OK, two fun facts there: first,
when they say "nearly 20%,"

368
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,120
it's because they are
rounding up from 11.

369
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,960
And secondly, they were
comparing kids

370
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,200
who had eaten cereal with
a control group of kids

371
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,000
who had had
no breakfast at all.

372
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,920
And that is not so much
a case for Mini-Wheats

373
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,800
as it is
the concept of food.

374
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,960
A much fairer slogan would be
"Frosted Mini-Wheats:

375
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,400
they're literally
better than nothing!"

376
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,720
Clearly, clearly...

377
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,720
clearly, we are now at a point
where food companies feel

378
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,000
no obligation
to accurately represent

379
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,800
what is in their products
and what they do for you,

380
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,040
a fact best encapsulated by
this one single commercial:

381
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,800
NARRATOR: When you give your kids Frosted
Strawberry Pop-Tarts 6

382
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,920
baked with real fruit,
they'll rise, and you'll shine.

383
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,960
Fuck you.

384
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,400
And I'll tell you why.

385
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,960
Because there is no significant
amount of fruit in Pop-Tarts.

386
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,760
And within 30 seconds
of eating one,

387
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,760
your children will not
rise and shine,

388
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,720
they'll run around punching
people in the dick before

389
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,840
collapsing into
a puddle of tears.

390
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,880
Look, if there's an upside
to applying

391
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,880
the First Amendment
to food labeling,

392
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,240
it's that if companies
can do this, then so can you.

393
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,520
You could, for instance,
put stickers

394
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,320
on a bottle of Pom Wonderful
claiming it

395
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,760
contains 4 whole Pomeranians.

396
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,600
Or banners saying that
Frosted Mini-Wheats are...

397
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,840
In fact, you'd be
constitutionally empowered

398
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,840
to go online to this address,

399
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,880
print a selection
of labels out,

400
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,520
and stick them to
existing food packaging.

401
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,040
Now, the worst thing you could
do--no, no, no.

402
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,000
No. The worst thing
you could do is go into a store

403
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,680
and put these
products on the shelves,

404
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,360
because that would be
breaking the law

405
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,960
in the funniest way imaginable.

406
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,800
And if you were to do it,
which you absolutely should not,

407
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,800
do not take a photograph
and send it to our show's

408
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,320
official Twitter account,

409
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,800
because that's something I would
not be interested in seeing.

410
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,520
And--and this is key-- don't blame me if you
get into trouble over this,

411
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,200
because even though I might
be 99.7% responsible,

412
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,800
my .3% innocence is my
characterizing flavor.

413
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,200
And now this.

414
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,000
ANNOUNCER: And now,
"Last Week Tonight's"...

415
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,560
This week, the National
Football League.

416
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,800
The NFL has long been
renowned for its concern

417
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,400
with the welfare
of all its employees.

418
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,760
But this week, one group of contractors have
some constructive criticism.

419
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,960
WOMAN: New allegations
this morning of mistreatment

420
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,680
by a group of Buffalo Bills
cheerleaders.

421
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,400
The Oakland Raiders
and Cincinnati Bengals

422
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,280
are also dealing
with wage disputes.

423
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,200
WOMAN: Some of whom claim they were paid less than
$5.00 an hour.

424
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,680
ANNOUNCER: Apparently $5.00 an
hour is just market rate

425
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,280
for sideline entertainers,
with one exception.

426
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,800
A mascot--that is the person who dresses up in the uniform
of an animal, usually--

427
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,400
gets paid about
$25,000 a year.

428
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,400
Plus, unlike cheerleaders,
mascots get benefits.

429
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,560
Enjoy your doctors' visits, anthropormophic
dolphin humanoid.

430
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,800
But while the NFL may not
pay cheerleaders much in money,

431
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,800
the advice in their
handbook is free,

432
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,960
and there's plenty of it.

433
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,960
From how much to talk
to how much to eat

434
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,160
to which feminine hygiene
products to use.

435
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,960
Oh, and of course, this...

436
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,800
WOMAN: And had to submit
to a "jiggle test"

437
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,560
so their boss could
critique their bodies.

438
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,240
ANNOUNCER: A jiggle test, because the sight of
quivering excess fat

439
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,680
has no place in the NFL.

440
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,280
And in return for all these
workplace indignities,

441
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,800
the NFL asks cheerleaders to do a job where they're
barely heard...

442
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,080
barely seen...

443
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,960
and the only responsibility
in their job title

444
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,720
that of leading cheers

445
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,800
usurped by Jumbotrons.

446
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,800
Their only remaining
responsibility

447
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,400
serving as human speed bumps
for gargantuan tight ends.

448
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,640
And that is why the NFL is this week's workplace
of the week.

449
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,760
For our final segment
tonight,

450
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,480
we'd like to look at the NSA.

451
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,520
They've had a turbulent
past 10 months,

452
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,000
but as Director of National
Intelligence James Clapper

453
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,560
said back in January,
the intelligence community

454
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,800
is determined to learn
their lessons.

455
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,680
The major takeaway for us,
certainly for me,

456
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,040
from the past several months
is that we must lean in

457
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,840
the direction of transparency,
wherever and whenever we can.

458
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,320
We're gonna be transparent.

459
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,080
I'll start: I don't
like bananas.

460
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,040
Now you tell me everything
you've ever done in your life.

461
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,160
Except, as we learned
earlier this week,

462
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,960
after leaning in the direction
of transparency,

463
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,120
Clapper didn't so much
"lean away" as

464
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,600
"run furiously in
the opposite direction."

465
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,760
WOMAN: Under new rules by
the administration

466
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,800
and the nation's intel chief,
James Clapper,

467
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,920
intelligence employees are banned from

468
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,600
speaking to journalists about
any intelligence-related matter.

469
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,800
Well, that'll restore
the American people's trust.

470
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,960
As we all know, the first step
in rebuilding any relationship

471
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,640
is cutting off any and all
communication.

472
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,880
Lucky for us,
the ex-head of the NSA,

473
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,920
General Keith Alexander,
retired in March,

474
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,960
which means that those rules
no longer apply to him,

475
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,200
leaving him free and generous
enough to speak with us.

476
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,680
Take a look.

477
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,800
General Keith Alexander
is a decorated military veteran

478
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,160
who ran the NSA
for the last 8 1/2 years.

479
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,160
During that time,
he faced questioning

480
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,720
from the highest ranking
officials in the land,

481
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,560
but now he would face
the opposite of that.

482
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,560
So, first, General, thank you so much
for sitting down with me.

483
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,400
Do you think that the NSA is suffering
from a perception problem

484
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,800
with the American people
at the moment,

485
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,880
bearing in mind that
the answer to that is yes.

486
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,520
Uh, absolutely.

487
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,400
You know, the first
assumption is that

488
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,400
you're collecting
on the American people.

489
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,800
And therein
lies the problem,

490
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
because the reality is the target is not
the American people.

491
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,800
No. The target is not
the American people,

492
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,800
but it seems that too often
you miss the target

493
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,800
and you hit the American
person standing next to a guy

494
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,720
"Whoa! Whoa! Him?"

495
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,800
But you see, we're not just out there gathering
U.S. communications,

496
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,600
listening to their
phone calls,

497
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,400
or collecting
their e-mails,

498
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,880
but that's the first thing
that people jump to.

499
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,800
But you are out there
doing that.

500
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,840
You're just saying you're not, then,
reading them.

501
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,440
You are gathering
that data.

502
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,800
No, no. So, in terms of going after U.S.
infrastructure

503
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,400
or sitting here in the United States
talking to--

504
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,800
A and B talking
in the United States--

505
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,200
we aren't
collecting that.

506
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,800
We don't collect that.

507
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,400
We do collect
the metadata--

508
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,400
a to-from number, date, time, group,
and duration of a call.

509
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,000
That's all
that's in there.

510
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,400
But that's not nothing.

511
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,960
That's significant
information.

512
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,320
Otherwise,
you wouldn't want it.

513
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,640
Is this the argument,
then, that to get

514
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,200
the needle,
you need the haystack?

515
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,600
Well, that's part
of the argument.

516
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,200
Well, the people's
concerns, I think,

517
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,200
are that you're not
just taking the haystack,

518
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,120
you're taking
the whole farm

519
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,880
and the county
and the state,

520
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,800
and you've now got some photos of
the farmer's wife

521
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,800
in the shower as well.

522
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,800
So NSA is not allowed to go do that
on its own.

523
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,880
It has oversight.

524
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,080
And so what the courts,
Congress,

525
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,520
and the administration
do is say,

526
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,840
"If you're gonna do
this, it has to comport

527
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,360
with the Constitution."

528
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,800
OLIVER: The NSA has
an unblemished record

529
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,880
of comporting with
the Constitution

530
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,040
and keeping tight control
over its information,

531
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,880
with the exception of
the thousands of times that,

532
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,800
according to the NSA's
own audits,

533
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,240
they accidentally accessed
Americans' information.

534
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
And then, of course,
there was this:

535
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,120
MAN ON TV: The NSA admits
some employees

536
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,920
have spied on their girlfriends,
boyfriends, husbands, and wives.

537
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,760
OLIVER: All of which prompted
a simple question.

538
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,880
Why should the American
people trust the NSA?

539
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,400
Well,
from my perspective,

540
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,960
because of what they do to protect this country
every day.

541
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,760
These are good people trying to do
the right thing.

542
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,760
Right, but much of
your reassurance there

543
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,960
is based on
your own moral code,

544
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,760
the idea of you thinking,

545
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,800
"Well, I wouldn't
abuse this power,

546
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,840
so why would anyone else?"

547
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,720
I would. I would--

548
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,200
If I had access to that
kind of information,

549
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,760
I would abuse
the hell out of it.

550
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,920
I'd be looking up information about
everyone that I knew.

551
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,000
I know that.

552
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,280
Everybody who goes
through the training,

553
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,720
they'd say, "John--
John, here's the deal.

554
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,800
"You're gonna get
access to this data,

555
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,400
"but you can't use it
for these things.

556
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,120
You can't use it for this, and you can't
use it for this."

557
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,200
Sure, I definitely
won't do that.

558
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,600
Where's my computer?

559
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,120
Right. And so, as soon as you get
on the computer,

560
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,600
what happens...
Sure.

561
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,600
you type in...

562
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,600
What's her name?

563
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
God, she screwed me
over so bad.

564
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,080
You hit return.

565
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,080
There.
And--

566
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,800
Oh, you bitch!
Oh, my God!

567
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,400
Oh, my God.

568
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,520
If you were caught
doing that,

569
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,080
then you would
either be removed...

570
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,800
Or promoted.

571
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,280
No, because the Department
of Justice

572
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,280
has ruled on several
of those cases.

573
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,800
Right. OK.
So finally,

574
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,960
let's talk about
branding.

575
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,760
The NSA's brand
has been damaged.

576
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,880
I think that's fair to say, right?
Right.

577
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,600
As we learned
with Blackwater,

578
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,440
you don't have to change the substance of anything
that you do

579
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,560
as long as you
visibly rebrand.

580
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,120
OK.

581
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,240
So let's try this.

582
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,120
The Washington Redskins.

583
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,040
It's a slightly less tainted brand
than yours.

584
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,640
Yeah, but probably not a good one
to go with.

585
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,840
Sorry. OK, no good.
How about this?

586
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,240
Mr. Tiggles.

587
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,400
Mr. Tiggles is not
just the mascot,

588
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,400
it's also the name
of the agency,

589
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,960
like Chuck E. Cheese.

590
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,120
Then the journalists
can't say,

591
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,240
"The NSA is storing
huge amounts of data

592
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,480
on foreign countries."

593
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,720
Instead, it'd say,

594
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,280
"Mr. Tiggles is storing
huge amounts of data..."

595
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,800
Isn't it clever?
He's in a boot?

596
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,040
Oh, you've massively overstepped your bounds,
Mr. Tiggles,

597
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,040
but I can't stay mad
at you.

598
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,080
You just want
to keep me safe.

599
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,080
Yeah. And I don't think that's gonna
work.

600
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,200
OK, how about
rebranding yourself

601
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,280
as a great listener?

602
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,920
The only agency in government that
really listens.

603
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,400
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying.

604
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,960
Because in many ways,
the NSA is the--

605
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,960
the perfect partner.

606
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,600
So, let me introduce you
to the new NSA, Trevor.

607
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,720
I think this is good.

608
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,880
Tell us about
your day,

609
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,120
everything about it.

610
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,920
How's Mohammed
at work?

611
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,520
How is he?
What's he been doing?

612
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,600
Trevor.

613
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,880
So if you had to choose
one of these,

614
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,600
which would it be?

615
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,360
I think that's something that perhaps you could
have people vote on.

616
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,760
OLIVER: So there you have it.

617
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,880
At long last, Americans are
being allowed to vote

618
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,360
on something having to do
with the NSA.

619
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,240
Just pick up your phone
and call any number

620
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,360
and say "A," "B," or "C,"

621
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,640
into the handset.

622
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,960
Don't worry, your vote

623
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,800
will be collected.

624
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,920
If you want to watch an extended version of that
interview online, go here:

625
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,920
My thanks to General Alexander.

626
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,800
Also, great thanks to Lisa Loeb.

627
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,800
Thank you for watching.
Join us again next week.

628
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,160
Good night!
