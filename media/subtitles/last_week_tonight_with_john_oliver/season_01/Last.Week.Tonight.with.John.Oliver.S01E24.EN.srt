00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,760
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,720
Episode 24

3
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,200
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,360
Thank you for being with us.
A quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,840
We begin tonight in Turkey:
the country named

6
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,280
after the fourth best sandwich
and the third best burger.

7
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,640
Turkey's president Erdogan,
is an important ally to the US.

8
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,280
But a controversial figure at home.

9
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,000
Erdogan has been a divisive leader.

10
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:06,320
There has been police brutality,
charges of corruption on his part.

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,640
Suspicious financial dealing, calling
to intimidate newspaper editors,

12
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,120
telling their family members how they
should hide large sums of money.

13
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,440
If you want to effectively hide
large sums of money,

14
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,120
I've got two words for you:
velcro wallet.

15
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,040
No one will ever suspect there
is money in those. Done.

16
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,240
You are welcome.

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,280
Erdogan unveiled his latest polarizing
project. And it is a doozy.

18
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,480
Turkish president unveiled
his new presidential palace

19
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,240
amidst huge controversy.

20
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,440
Opposition politicians mocked
the extravagance of the palace,

21
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,440
which has 1000 rooms
and a cost more than 270 million euros.

22
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,600
A thousand rooms ! Impressive,
because after 500 rooms,

23
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,960
you must be straining to think
of what to do with them.

24
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,760
This is my giant room
full of tapioca pudding.

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,320
On your left is the Pivenary, with
12 000 photographs of Jeremy Piven.

26
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,960
It's the world largest collection,
outside of Jeremy Piven's house.

27
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,440
Over here is my "room" room,
where I watch the movie "The Room".

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,840
This whole palace is insane.

29
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,200
Situated
on 1.6 million square feet of land

30
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,680
and this is what drives up the price,
it's in an excellent school district.

31
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,320
The location has been controversial.

32
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,080
Environmentalists are angry
the complex is being built

33
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,800
on one the city's
best preserved green spaces

34
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,240
and that hundreds of trees
were cut down.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,360
Ergodan offset that environmental
impact by buying a Sodastream,

36
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,800
we're square.

37
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,080
But Erdogan is not relenting,
even saying:

38
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,120
"no one can prevent
the completion of this building."

39
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,600
"If they are powerful enough,
let them come and demolish it."

40
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,520
That takes some balls.
Which is doubly impressive,

41
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,640
considering that,
a few years back,

42
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,800
he had his balls stomped on
by a horse.

43
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,000
Don't you dare feel sorry
for that man.

44
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,280
He has a thousand rooms in which
to nurse his crushed balls.

45
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,960
And to that Turkish horse,
I say this:

46
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,880
you should not step
on people's balls,

47
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,120
but in this solitary instance,
kudos horse, kudos.

48
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,760
Let's move on to local news:

49
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,440
citizens of New York got
an exciting internet opportunity.

50
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,000
The city's top-level domain, dot nyc,
is available to all New Yorkers.

51
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,000
New Yorkers are now eligible
to purchase dot nyc domain names,

52
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,680
because sometimes a Wesleyan alumni
email address isn't enough

53
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,800
to let people on the internet know
you live in Brooklyn.

54
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,080
There was an immediate rush
to register web addresses.

55
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,600
Even from ex-mayor
Michael Bloomberg.

56
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,560
The law firm representing Bloomberg's
foundation purchased

57
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,600
several hundred .nyc addresses
related to his name.

58
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,520
Some are normal like
official Mike Bloomberg dot nyc,

59
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,280
but some aren't as flattering,
Mike Bloomberg is a dweeb dot nyc.

60
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,080
Or Mike is too short dot nyc.
Many others were vulgar.

61
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,200
They were vulgar. Because these
are some actual domain names:

62
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,240
"fuck Bloomberg dot nyc",
"fuck Michael Bloomberg dot nyc",

63
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,640
"fuck Mike Bloomberg dot nyc"

64
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,480
and "Michael Bloomberg is too
short to be president dot nyc".

65
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:57,720
I am guessing, this all began
with Bloomberg walking up to his staff:

66
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,840
"what do people like
to say about me ?"

67
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,200
and after about 400 suggestions,
saying: "Stop. Let's buy them all."

68
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,880
He left a few on the table.
For instance,

69
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,080
while he did get "Michael Bloomberg
is a weiner dot nyc", with an e-i,

70
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,720
the "i-e" version is still available
or it was available.

71
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,840
Because to be honest,
we bought it,

72
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:28,440
and we are using it to host
a photograph of Bloomberg

73
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,360
with a possible erection during
a hurricane Sandy press conference.

74
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,000
So we're not wasting it.

75
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,040
We also bought
"tiny tiny Mike Bloomberg dot nyc",

76
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,200
to host an image of him sleeping
in a matchbox bed.

77
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,680
You'll wake him !
He's so tiny !

78
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,240
We also got "Bloomberg eats baby
corn as if it's real corn dot nyc."

79
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,360
None of these are for sale !
You might've bought three elections,

80
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,960
but you can't have these !

81
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,480
I would encourage everyone
to go to ownit.nyc right now

82
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,720
and buy the domain name
of your choice.

83
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,320
As of this taping,
all of these are available !

84
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,400
There is no better feeling on earth
than owning something

85
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,200
a desperate billionaire
is unable to purchase.

86
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:26,480
Finally tonight: I would like to talk
about salmon.

87
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,480
Cat food for people.

88
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,960
Tuna's understudy that
you hope never has to go on.

89
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,520
And "that stupid fish that
doesn't know how rivers work."

90
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,760
Salmon famously have to fight
its way upstream to spawn.

91
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,160
Thanks to hydroelectric dams,
that's become difficult.

92
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,920
Don't worry, because as we found
out recently, America is on it.

93
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,200
I'm Ben Tracy in Washington state,
where we're going to introduce you

94
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,840
to a pretty sweet piece of technology
known as the salmon cannon,

95
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,080
coming up on CBS This Morning.

96
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,360
Sometimes, people say
the news has lost its touch,

97
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,880
but everyone now and then,
they fucking nail it.

98
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:17,480
A cannon that fires fish through
a tube, and over a dam, is incredible.

99
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,240
If you're wondering what it looks like
when they come out,

100
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,440
the company that makes it,
called Whooshh Innovations,

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,680
produced a spectacular slow-motion
video, set to classical music.

102
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,200
In your darkest moments of despair,

103
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,320
when you see a world
torn apart by war,

104
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,960
remember that video and think
"we can do great things".

105
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,720
Let me tell you how much
I love the salmon cannon.

106
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,960
So much, we made our own
cannon this week.

107
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,560
So, this thing is pretty powerful.
Who wants to give this puppy a go ?

108
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,000
Let's see
where this salmon ends up.

109
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,040
The situation in the Mid East,
only getting more complicated...

110
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:28,040
Okay, so we know it works.
Let's fire two fish somewhere else.

111
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,280
Thank you spatulas...

112
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,440
Very nice. Let's try
something a little more difficult.

113
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,000
You took my daughter from me,
what did you expect ?

114
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,160
I'm not trying to deny it
but I don't remember.

115
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,920
- That's convenient.
- It cost me your love !

116
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,000
This is the greatest object
that has ever been invented.

117
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,960
I am emptying this bucket,
let us see how big we can go.

118
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,880
I'm Michele Beadle, incredible footage
coming from Houston Rockets' practice

119
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,640
where Dwight Howard
was injured making a block.

120
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,080
Howard broke two fingers
and is expected to miss...

121
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,280
Members
of the Obama administration...

122
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,120
A new report about
Iran's nuclear program...

123
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,440
That's why it's important...

124
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,440
Eyebrows...

125
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,520
What the hell ?

126
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,920
Breakfast !

127
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,360
Olive oil.

128
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,760
Interesting how...

129
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,920
Cut, stop. R2, awesome,

130
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,960
except it's bleep bleep squawk bloop,
stick to the script...

131
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,640
I'm glad they didn't ask you...

132
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,920
It gets better.

133
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,200
And the Broadway play...

134
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,520
15  blade.

135
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:29,720
I quit, I can't work like this.
Shut up, Chewie !

136
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,000
Salmon !

137
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,240
Moving on...

138
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,880
Let's move to our main story:
the lottery.

139
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,440
The second best use of magic marker
on Ping-Pong balls,

140
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,480
after Kermit the frog's eyeballs.

141
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,320
Now, this past week saw
a huge Mega Millions draw.

142
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,600
A big winning lottery ticket
sold in New York !

143
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,400
Lots of people here have been
peeking at their lottery tickets.

144
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,560
The Mega Millions mystery
this evening. $321 million jackpot.

145
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,280
The search
for the winner is on tonight.

146
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,760
The winner shouldn't be hard to find.
If someone at your work marched in

147
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:21,400
and told everyone to go fuck
themselves, that's your winner.

148
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,720
Don't worry
if you didn't hit the jackpot.

149
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,840
You will have an unbelievable
number of other opportunities.

150
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,520
44 states have lotteries.
You can't have missed the commercials,

151
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,960
featuring everything from
a Ping-Pong ball thunderstorm,

152
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,000
to a furry dressed as a cat playing
with a ball of money,

153
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,600
to a weird lucky man deciding
to spend his lottery winnings

154
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,440
terrifying a penguin
by taking it hang-gliding.

155
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,360
That is a bizarrely specific use
of a big lottery win.

156
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,960
I'm strapping a penguin to my chest
and taking to the skies.

157
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,720
Fuck you, evolution !
I decide who flies ! My choice.

158
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,760
Lottery commercials are seductive
and they're everywhere.

159
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,120
States spend half a billion dollars
on them every year.

160
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,000
Because the lottery is a massive
moneymaker for them.

161
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,280
Last year alone, lottery sales
totaled about 68 billion dollars.

162
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,200
$68 billion ! That's more than
Americans spent on movie tickets,

163
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,040
music, porn, the NFL, MLB
and video games combined.

164
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,720
Americans spent more on the lottery
than they spent on "America".

165
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,560
It's a little strange for
the government to be running

166
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,400
what is basically
a gigantic gambling business.

167
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,000
But we don't think about lotteries
like that.

168
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,840
Perhaps because they're sold to us
more as charitable foundations.

169
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,640
Three billion dollars for education
opens a lot of doors.

170
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,680
The Tennessee lottery, game-changing,
life-changing fun.

171
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,840
Education matters
to Oregonians.

172
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,280
$5 billion in lottery dollars
have gone to public education.

173
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,880
It does good things.

174
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,400
Every time
you play a New York lottery game,

175
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,280
a portion of your sale goes to aid
New York state school children.

176
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,640
New York lottery: everybody wins !

177
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,680
Thank you for being a friend.

178
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,680
Those ads are implying that anyone
who does not play is selfish.

179
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,000
Why don't you want to educate these
harmonizing children, you monster ?

180
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,720
"Everybody wins ",
"the lottery does good things"

181
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,800
and
"it's game changing, life-changing fun."

182
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,640
Is it ? Does it ? And do they ?
Let's start with the basics:

183
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,720
the lottery generates
$68 billion in sales a year.

184
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,680
Where does that money come from ?

185
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,920
Over the last two decades,
lower income households spend

186
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,040
a higher percentage
of their money on lottery tickets.

187
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,160
Lots of people like to gamble
and for lower-income households,

188
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,360
lottery's an affordable way to do it.

189
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,920
When wealthy people
want to take risks,

190
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,080
they invest in the stock market
or leave their wife for Amber,

191
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,280
without signing a pre-nup,
because Amber's forever.

192
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,000
Besides, she just gets you !
She's tiring but she'll be there.

193
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,840
The lottery is in the business
of selling people hope.

194
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,000
Start a college fund for our kids.

195
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,280
Start a college fund for their kids.

196
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,320
A game with jackpots
worthy of your dreams.

197
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,400
Mega Millions. Dream mega.

198
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,520
That feels like
an ad for a mutual fund.

199
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,520
The lottery is not an investment.

200
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,840
Those mega dreams
are mega unlikely to happen.

201
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,720
What are the real chances ?
A lousy one in 176 million.

202
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,480
Winning the Mega Millions
is akin to getting struck by lightning

203
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,680
while you're being eaten by a shark.

204
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:07,560
That is both an evocative image
and an amazing pitch for a movie.

205
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,920
There's this guy.
He's getting eaten by a shark, see ?

206
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,200
Lightning hits him,
he switches minds with the shark.

207
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,600
Shark wins the lottery.
It's 'Freaky Friday' meets 'Jaws'.

208
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,480
I'm calling it...
Slumshark Gillionaire.

209
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,040
Channing Tatum has passed.

210
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,560
The lottery does have some
smaller games and prizes,

211
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,280
but even then, it pays out a much
lower percentage of its revenues

212
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,840
than even horseracing.

213
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,720
When you lose the lottery and
you're angry with your ticket,

214
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,080
you don't even have the satisfaction
of knowing it'll turn into dog food.

215
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,000
And yet
we are still drawn to the lottery.

216
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,040
Partly because
we're told to ignore the odds.

217
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,080
It's your dream,
anything can happen.

218
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,520
Dream, play, win.

219
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,920
You never know.

220
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,200
Power your dreams
for just two bucks.

221
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:09,800
In the time you watch that montage,
I bought these lottery tickets.

222
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,680
Someone's gonna win,
it might as well be me !

223
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,960
Even when people do win big,
things tend to go south fast.

224
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,000
We've seen tragic headlines
about winners like:

225
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,640
"Lottery Winner Blows
Through $27 Million",

226
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,560
"Lottery Winner Found Dead",

227
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,840
or "Brother Hired Hitman
Over $16 million Jackpot Win".

228
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,600
It seems winning the lottery
can be like marrying Tom Cruise.

229
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,240
It seems amazing in your mind.
You might dream about it happening.

230
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,080
But if it does, five years later,
the magic will be over,

231
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,520
you'll be estranged from family
and you will have seen things

232
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,360
you can never unsee, never.

233
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,720
In Israel, lottery winners
are photographed

234
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,040
wearing masks
to protect their identities.

235
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,960
In the '90s, this is how one man
from Gaza collected his prize:

236
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,720
Most winners don't turn up
with a bag over their head,

237
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,640
but this Palestinian
wanted to remain anonymous.

238
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:16,200
Winning is such a curse that you
can find yourself in the Middle East

239
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,040
with a bag over your head because
something "good" happened to you.

240
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,080
So why do people play ?
For some, they can't stop.

241
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,160
The lottery can be addictive.
States know this.

242
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,840
Many lotteries offer resources
to help problem gamblers.

243
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,520
The Illinois lottery has a section on
their website for "responsible gaming",

244
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,760
although, when we clicked on the link,
we got a pop-up ad for the lotto.

245
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,480
There is a reason that the first
step in a 12-step program

246
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,960
isn't: "Congratulations !
Why not reward yourself"

247
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,360
"with a refreshing gin and tonic ?"

248
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,120
I'm sure that that is just
an innocent mistake.

249
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Like if you Google "lottery
intervention", this is what comes up:

250
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,800
Need a lottery intervention ?

251
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,920
Play the new DC Fast Play Games
from the DC lottery.

252
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,560
Feel the thrill
of winning instantly.

253
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,440
Are you kidding me ?
Someone at the DC lottery

254
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,640
deserves a promotion
before they go directly to hell.

255
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,440
At the same time they're supposedly
addressing problem gambling,

256
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,960
states are expanding into
even more addictive products.

257
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,320
Look at Oregon !

258
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,400
The lottery makes about $1 billion
every two years.

259
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,200
About 80% of it, maybe
even more, 86, 90%...

260
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,640
That's what
we're running on the screen.

261
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,000
... comes from one source, mostly
video slot machines or video poker.

262
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,560
The majority of Oregon's lottery income
come from video slots and video poker.

263
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,080
Meaning that Oregon claims
"this" is a "lottery" machine.

264
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,880
Just like this is a lottery wheel !
And this is a lottery table !

265
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,080
And of course we all remember
Martin Scorsese's movie, "Lottery".

266
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,200
Machines like these are not only
addictive, they are lucrative.

267
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,440
Internal Oregon lottery data
indicates that regular lottery players

268
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,200
lost an average
of $106 dollars per year.

269
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,520
Whereas video poker and slots players
lost an average of $2 564.

270
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,680
That's an insane amount of money.
You could buy a '98 Mazda.

271
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,080
And you should. It's got
a moon roof and six-way speakers !

272
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,280
Get in it now and drive in the opposite
direction from any video poker machine.

273
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,280
Good luck if you live in Oregon,
cause these machines are everywhere.

274
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,280
There are more
than 12 000 of them in the state.

275
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,560
That kind of ubiquity puts
some people in serious danger.

276
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,680
My boyfriend and I have gotten
into fights over, you know...

277
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,760
I'm just going somewhere
with a friend of mine

278
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,920
and I end up
playing video poker...

279
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,120
Or I'm supposed to buy food
and I come with no food and no money,

280
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,600
and as soon as I walk in the door,
he knows.

281
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,400
Then we don't have any food.

282
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,640
The machines that are causing her
such trouble are run by the state.

283
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,320
A state which proclaims
its lottery "does good things".

284
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,800
It may not be a coincidence
that the logo for the Oregon lottery

285
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,720
is someone crossing their fingers,
the universal sign for lying.

286
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,480
Maybe, the next question...

287
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,440
Maybe the next question
should be this:

288
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,200
why do state lawmakers
keep approving all this ?

289
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:53,080
As those children told us, lotteries
are about good causes like education.

290
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,040
That's always been the excuse.

291
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,360
State lotteries were illegal
in this country until 1964,

292
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,080
when New Hampshire
launched the first one,

293
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,800
under the guise
of a very familiar message.

294
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,840
How come you're buying
one of these tickets ?

295
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,960
This is the first one in the country
and I would like to participate in it.

296
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,280
I also think it's for
a very good cause, education.

297
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,440
There's not a better
reason to buy one of these.

298
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,840
There isn't a better reason.

299
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,560
But there are better "ways"
to fund education.

300
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,880
Sales tax, bake sale, or putting
cash in an envelope,

301
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,560
writing "school" on the front
and mailing it.

302
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,200
For all the claims that lotteries
are a huge boost to education,

303
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,320
the reality is a little different.

304
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,200
Our investigation of government
spending in the 24 states

305
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,840
that dedicate lottery funds
for education yields a bad report card.

306
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,680
The percentage of state spending
on education is down or flat

307
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,600
in 21 of those states.

308
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:01,200
Lotteries provided no additional
funding in 21 out of 24 states.

309
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,560
As math students in one
of those places would put it:

310
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,440
"that is nearly fifty percent."

311
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:13,440
How is this possible ?
Let's look at North Carolina.

312
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,640
Their governor inaugurated the
"North Carolina education lottery"

313
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,080
nearly a decade ago
with big promises.

314
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,560
When the lottery is implemented,

315
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,360
we'll be adding another
half billion annually for education.

316
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,440
Half a billion extra !
That sounds great.

317
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,560
You think by now,
all North Carolina preschoolers

318
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,080
are strutting around in fine
bespoke suits,

319
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,280
quoting Nietzsche
and Kierkegaard.

320
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,320
But in fact, North Carolina
spends less per student

321
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,120
than it did before
the lottery even began.

322
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,280
If you're thinking,
how is that possible ?

323
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,200
It's because money in state budgets
tends to move around.

324
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,640
Trying to add money
for one purpose

325
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,200
is a bit like trying to piss in one
corner of a swimming pool.

326
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,480
It's going all over the place,
no matter what you claim.

327
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,800
Let me give you
just a narrow example:

328
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,840
In 2012, North Carolina used
$100 million of lottery money

329
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,080
for school construction,
that didn't mean the budget

330
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,880
was $100 million bigger
than it would've been.

331
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,280
While that money was flowing in,
other money was flowing out.

332
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,560
A portion of corporate income taxes
used to go toward construction,

333
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,680
but when the lottery passed,
that money went away,

334
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,960
substituted with lottery revenue.

335
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,440
Where's the corporate tax
money now ? Who knows ?!

336
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,120
There's not even a warm spot
where it once was.

337
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,040
But in a unconnected
development,

338
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,520
North Carolina plans to cut corporate
taxes over the next two years.

339
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,680
Thanks for playing the lottery,
North Carolina ! Better luck next time !

340
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,440
Despite all this, states are not
only keeping faith in lotteries,

341
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,880
they're trying to reach new players,
by putting it on your cell phone.

342
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,960
Illinois launched an app to let you
buy tickets on your phone.

343
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,720
Which is terrifying. We all know
that if, starting right now,

344
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,920
your mother could play the lottery
as easily as she plays "Candy Crush",

345
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,800
she'd be preparing Thanksgiving
dinner over a trash can fire.

346
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:24,840
I'm sure that Illinois will make
the same argument everyone does:

347
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,200
"it brings
in money for good causes."

348
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,960
Except, lotteries are bad for losers,
often bad for winners

349
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,360
and a compromising way
to assist state budgets.

350
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,920
Gambling is a little like alcohol.

351
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,920
Most people like it,
some are addicted to it

352
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,600
and it's not like the state
can or should outlaw it altogether,

353
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,920
but it'd be strange if the state
was in the liquor business,

354
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,960
advertising it by claiming
that every shot of vodka

355
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,800
helps schoolchildren learn.

356
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,840
Thank me for being a friend !

357
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,760
I'm gonna get those kids an IPad !
I'm a winner ! Everybodys a winner.

358
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,280
And now this:

359
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:16,880
People on TV misunderstanding what
the term 'spoiler alert' means.

360
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,960
Spoiler alert, there's no one
food, that's gonna perk you up.

361
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,200
Not a spoiler.

362
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,440
Train versus tractor trailer

363
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,400
and spoiler alert,
the tractor trailer loses.

364
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,960
Not a spoiler.
We just saw what happened.

365
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,400
Some of the newest additions
at our nation's zoos

366
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,600
and spoiler alert,
they're adorable.

367
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,040
Not a spoiler. Everyone knows
baby animals are adorable.

368
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,760
That classic summertime pattern
is going to be returning

369
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,960
but it may be a little bit of
a spoiler alert for your weekend.

370
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,640
You're using it wrong.

371
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,840
The jobs numbers are in and
spoiler alert, they're really good.

372
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,880
Reporting news is not a spoiler.
That's your job.

373
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,200
Will Republicans take control
of the US Senate ?

374
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,560
They need six seats to pull it off,
so what will happen ?

375
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,320
Spoiler alert, we don't know.

376
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,200
No !

377
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,920
And tonight, finally, I have some
good news and some bad news.

378
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,000
The bad news is,
this is our final show of the year.

379
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,560
The good news is,
we will be back in 2015.

380
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,120
Frankly, that seems like

381
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,160
a poor decision on HBO's part,
but we're not complaining.

382
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,520
We've had a fun year, dealing
with all the most important stories,

383
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,400
from dead space sex geckos,
to pole-dancing chickens,

384
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,640
to Scottish unicorns,
to whatever this was...

385
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:55,080
This exuberance is never going to
blow up in our face ! USA !

386
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,200
That was a show about vicious
anti-homosexuality laws in Uganda.

387
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,720
Amazingly, that's actually true.

388
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,200
There were also
the occasional musical numbers.

389
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,200
Our prison population
is bigger than Slovenia.

390
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,160
Because we put people in jail
instead of treating schizophrenia.

391
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,720
You find a better rhyme for "treating
schizophrenia" ! It is not easy.

392
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,880
It has been a fun first year
and I want to take a moment to thank

393
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,400
our whole staff,
who have worked hard

394
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,160
and to thank the other personnel
who've helped us a great deal.

395
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,840
First, the characters from our
prisons piece.

396
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,840
- Thank you so much for your help !
- No problem, Mr. Oliver !

397
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,680
I can't believe
you're already done for the year.

398
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,520
It's just flown by, the time !

399
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,200
Can't believe you're going on vacation
after only 24 episodes.

400
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,120
I don't know about "only" 24.
That seems like a lot.

401
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,400
Jimmy Fallon does five shows
a week. And his are an hour long.

402
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,600
- I'm not Jimmy Fallon.
- I wish you were.

403
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:08,320
- He's amazing.
- Total entertainer. Quadruple threat.

404
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:13,000
Yes, he's so handsome, too !
So good looking.

405
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,680
,I get your point.
You like Jimmy, I get it.

406
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,440
I wanted to say thank you, you look
transfixed by the idea of him.

407
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,960
I wanted to say thank you
not just to you guys

408
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,400
but to some others,
before the season ends.

409
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,200
So let me take this opportunity
to thank our pole-dancing chicken,

410
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,400
with our sexy soybean,
our horny space gecko !

411
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,800
Our Miss America !
Our Scottish independence unicorn !

412
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:46,960
Our breakdancing Lincoln !
And our supreme court dogs !

413
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,720
Here they are !

414
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,240
Who's a very important check
and balance, you are ! You are !

415
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,120
Thank you so much for watching !
We will see you next year !

416
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,520
I can't thank you enough !
Good night !

417
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,640
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

418
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,000
END OF EPISODE 24
