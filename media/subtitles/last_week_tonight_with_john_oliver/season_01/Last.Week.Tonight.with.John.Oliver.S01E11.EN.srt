1
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,800
Welcome, welcome, welcome to "Last Week Tonight."

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,840
I'm John Oliver.

3
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,360
Thank you so much for being with us,

4
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,000
and first off--first off a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,320
In a nutshell, it has been fucking depressing.

6
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,440
Most of the week was dominated by the conflict in Gaza, which

7
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,440
has been escalating sharply over the past couple of days.

8
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,960
As of the taping of this comedy show, 18 Israeli

9
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,920
soldiers have been killed, as well as over 400 Palestinians,

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,160
the vast majority of which
appear to be civilians.

11
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,320
This whole story is
depressingly familiar,

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,920
and perhaps the best way
of illustrating that is

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,040
with CNN's Anderson Cooper
because this--this was

14
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,360
his report from last week.

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,840
Hamas, which controls
Gaza, isn't backing down.

16
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,640
Its rockets are reaching
deeper into Israel.

17
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,520
Now, if that rings a bell
with you, it could be

18
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,640
because you're
remembering this.

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,280
The number of rockets being
fired from Gaza City, from

20
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,440
the central area in Gaza
City, toward Israel--

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,760
Here's the thing.

22
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,920
That report was from 2012,
not that you'd know it,

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,040
because Anderson Cooper looks
and sounds exactly the same,

24
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,680
much as he did in 2009 when he
was asking exactly the same

25
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,800
question that he's been
asking all this week.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,920
I mean, the Palestinians
blame Israelis

27
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,320
for killing civilians.

28
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,520
Israelis say, "Look. You
know, we're targeting military

29
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,800
"installations, Hamas
installations, but they are

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,800
"hiding weapons in
people's homes.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,360
They are enmeshed within
the civilian population."

32
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,880
Who's right here?

33
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,080
Why is CNN even wasting money
having him report on this when

34
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,880
they could just literally
rerun his coverage from 5

35
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,800
years ago and no
one would notice?

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,320
Somehow--somehow, in 5 years,
this situation has not improved,

37
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,520
and his face has lost none
of its virile

38
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,760
yet tender magnetism.

39
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,680
In fact, you can even go
back to 2006, when yet again,

40
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,440
Israel and the Palestinians
were trading rocket strikes,

41
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,880
and guess who was there.

42
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,800
More than about 100 katyusha
rockets and mortars fell

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,920
in and around this one town.

44
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,760
How does he still
look the same?

45
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,880
Look, this was me back in 2006.

46
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,920
Time has ravaged me.

47
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,680
I have been ravaged by time,

48
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,240
and I have spent zero
time in Gaza.

49
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,000
If this week has taught us one
thing, it's that the Middle

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,600
East is truly the Anderson
Cooper's face of geopolitical

51
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,320
disputes in that, in defiance
of all appeals to reason

52
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,000
and human decency,
it never fucking changes.

53
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,520
I actually think that in his
attic, Anderson Cooper has

54
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,400
a painting of himself as
an old man in a peaceful

55
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,360
Middle East.

56
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,640
Now, the Gaza dispute has been
so depressing, it was enough

57
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,040
to make you wish for any
story to distract us.

58
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,240
Unfortunately, on Thursday
we got one when, for unknown

59
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,000
reasons, Ukrainian rebels
apparently used Russian

60
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,880
weapons to shoot
down an airliner.

61
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,280
It was clearly an
international tragedy, and you

62
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,440
would think it might cause
Vladimir Putin to do some

63
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,280
serious soul searching or at
least some soul manufacturing,

64
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,000
but instead, he went
a different way.

65
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,400
MAN: Russian president
Vladimir Putin says Ukraine is

66
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,840
to blame, saying, quote,
"This tragedy would not have

67
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,600
happened if there had
been peace on that land."

68
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,320
Yeah, maybe, but it's also
worth noting this wouldn't

69
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,600
have happened if you, Vladimir
Putin, hadn't given the rebels

70
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,400
those fucking missiles.

71
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,840
What great outcome were
you anticipating from

72
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,160
that, exactly?

73
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,920
Because no story in history
has ever ended, "And then,

74
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,440
"an assortment of angry rebels
were given military-grade

75
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,320
"weapons, they used them
responsibly, and we all lived

76
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,160
happily ever after."

77
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,120
That has never happened ever.

78
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,960
There are so many upsetting
questions surrounding this

79
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,960
tragedy, from "Why did Putin
give them those weapons?"

80
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,480
to "Why did they shoot
down that plane?"

81
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,200
to "Can you please
change the subject?

82
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,160
"This is supposed to
be a comedy show.

83
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,240
The Leftovers was less
depressing than this."

84
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,120
But one of the most baffling
questions of all involves

85
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,800
the airline in question,
Malaysian Airlines.

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,960
The question is, why would
they continue flying over

87
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,120
a known war zone where,
in fact, there have been 3

88
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,840
shoot-downs in the past week?

89
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,520
It's a very simple answer,
I'm afraid: a little bit

90
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,800
of lackadaisical behavior, and
secondly, it's less fuel cost.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,600
Hold on.

92
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,760
If it's true that some
airlines choose to fly over

93
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,880
a war zone to save money, then
I'd like to take a moment to

94
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,360
address the world's airlines
and say, "Don't do that!

95
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,800
"Look, you've already got
us paying surcharges

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,760
"for everything: $25 to check a
bag, $5.00 for headphones, $10

97
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,160
"to watch Katy Perry: Part of
Me with your $5.00 headphones

98
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,320
"that do not work.

99
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,720
"So, please, do feel free
to offer us the option

100
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,360
"at check-in of a 35-dollar
surcharge to steer clear

101
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,920
of any active
fucking war zones."

102
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,920
"What do you think, honey?

103
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,320
Should we do it?"

104
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,720
"Let's treat ourselves.

105
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,760
We're on vacation."

106
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,720
And finally, thankfully, we
turn to some lighter news:

107
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,240
crippling gambling
addiction in Singapore.

108
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,760
At the start of this year's
World Cup, which, of course,

109
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,320
Germany won, Singapore
produced a powerful

110
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,200
anti-gambling commercial.

111
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,920
See if you can spot
its one fatal flaw.

112
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,560
BOY: I really can't wait
for the World Cup.

113
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,960
Who do you think
is gonna win it?

114
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,600
My dad said
Brazil will win.

115
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,720
How about you, Andy?

116
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
I hope Germany
will win.

117
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,400
Why?

118
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:32,920
My dad bet all my
savings on them.

119
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,840
Yeah, but Germany won, kid!

120
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,160
Your dad's the greatest!

121
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,440
He's the best!

122
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,440
Hey, why the long face?

123
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,360
That kid is now the
richest sad person since

124
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,640
Kristen Stewart.

125
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,040
Now clearly, clearly, this was
a little awkward, so Singapore

126
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,840
actually created a second ad,
where the boy is asked, "Your

127
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,400
"dad's team won.

128
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,240
Did you get your
savings back?"

129
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,240
to which he responds,
"No. Dad never stops.

130
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,320
He wants to bet
one more time."

131
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,920
But, yeah, of course he does.

132
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,120
The guy's on a hot streak,
kid, and you know what?

133
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,400
The only thing that can
stop that is your negative

134
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,080
attitude, you ungrateful
little shit.

135
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,200
Now, interestingly, Singapore
actually has a long history

136
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,040
of blowing it with their
anti-gambling advertisements.

137
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,160
Just take a look.

138
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,800
I hope the Sea Hawks
win the Super Bowl.

139
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,640
My dad bet all our
savings on them.

140
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,880
Good luck.

141
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
There's no way a second-year
quarterback can beat future

142
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,120
Hall-of-Famer Peyton Manning.

143
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,360
Your dad's
a complete zero.

144
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,600
I'm gonna
be homeless

145
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:52,880
and die in
a shopping cart.

146
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,680
What's the matter, Andy?

147
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,240
My dad bet all our savings again
on California Chrome.

148
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,920
To win this year's Triple Crown?

149
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,880
No. He has to win the Kentucky Derby
and the Preakness

150
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,920
but then get fourth place in
the Belmont Stakes.

151
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,880
Wow. That's
a very specific bet.

152
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,080
I know. It's never
gonna happen.

153
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,160
Fabricio, can you move my hot-stone
massage to 3:30?

154
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,760
Thank you, Fabricio.

155
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:30,640
Ciao.

156
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,800
Guys, my dad's
out of control.

157
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,800
Shut up, Andy.

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,160
Yeah, shut up.

159
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,200
Wait, this time my dad bet everything
we have that

160
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,800
in the first half of the second week of July,
news will

161
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,240
break that Ryan Gosling will have impregnated
Eva Mendes

162
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:53,600
and that they're expecting a baby
in October.

163
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,920
Your dad is the best!

164
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,800
BOY: Gambling is awesome!

165
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,320
Look.

166
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,920
The big lesson from Singapore
is, gambling is terrible

167
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,560
unless Dad is
really feeling it.

168
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,320
And now this.

169
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,840
ANNOUNCER: And now, "Last Week
Tonight" asks, how is this

170
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,200
still a thing?

171
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,040
This week, the
Commonwealth Games.

172
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,080
How is this still a thing?

173
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,800
If you live in certain parts
of the world, this week you're

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,920
looking forward to one thing.

175
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,560
WOMAN: We've got the
Commonwealth Games coming up.

176
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,800
The Commonwealth Games.

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,320
WOMAN: Commonwealth Games.
MAN: Commonwealth Games.

178
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,760
DIFFERENT MAN: Welcome to
the friendly games.

179
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,160
ANNOUNCER: In America, we not
only don't know what the hell

180
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,600
they're talking about, we
couldn't tell you if you

181
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,360
offered us $2,000.

182
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,800
That would be the
Commonwealth Games.

183
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,240
ANNOUNCER: Here's a question.

184
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,800
What the fuck are the
Commonwealth Games, other than

185
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,760
the winner of the Creepiest
Mascot on Earth competition?

186
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,120
Well, imagine the Olympics
without the United States,

187
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,720
China, and Russia.

188
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,160
Then imagine a track meet

189
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,400
dominated by sprinters
from Wales.

190
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,160
MAN: Wales!

191
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,640
ANNOUNCER: And you have
the Commonwealth Games,

192
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,600
a competition that's only
open to members

193
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,280
of the British Commonwealth.

194
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,120
The Games began in the
1930s, just as the British

195
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,640
Empire was falling flat on
its face, and for some reason

196
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,840
continue to this day.

197
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Once every 4 years, the world
is treated to the spectacle

198
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,200
of the Queen showing her
full emotional range, from

199
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,920
irritated in Victoria to
damp in Manchester to bored

200
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,600
in Melbourne.

201
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,520
But why would she be bored?

202
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,800
The Commonwealth Games feature
all the world's top sports,

203
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,520
such as squash, lawn bowls,
competitive mountain biking,

204
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,280
and netball, which is
basically what basketball

205
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,160
would be if you didn't have
the rights to play basketball.

206
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,920
As many of these games are
British-derived, it's no

207
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,920
wonder that England has soared all the way to the top

208
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,000
of second place of

209
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,600
the medal count.

210
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,680
And for non sports fans,
the Games also offer opening

211
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,880
and closing ceremonies that
speak to our sense of wonder,

212
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,560
specifically the wonder of
what an off-Broadway version

213
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,760
of the Olympic ceremonies
would look like.

214
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,080
So tonight we salute this
week's Commonwealth Games,

215
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,320
the historic display of a
once-mighty nation gathering

216
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,840
together the countries it lost
and finding a way to lose to

217
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,600
them once more.

218
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,600
So the next time

219
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,960
you're on "Jeopardy!"

220
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,000
and the answer is

221
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,840
"the Commonwealth Games,"

222
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,480
the only possible question is,
how is this still a thing?

223
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,560
OK, moving on.

224
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,040
Moving on.

225
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,360
Our main story tonight
concerns something Americans

226
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,480
simply can't get
enough of: prison.

227
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,520
We love to be entertained by
it, from "Orange is the New

228
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,760
Black" to seemingly MSNBC's
entire weekend programming to

229
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,560
the TNT classic "Tim Robbins Stands Shirtless in the Rain:

230
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,040
the Movie."

231
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,320
We love prison so much, a
shocking number of Americans

232
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,040
are currently inside one, as
we learned last week during

233
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,680
a House Judiciary
Committee hearing.

234
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,520
Our nation now has the
greatest number of prisoners

235
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,000
of any country in the world.

236
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,080
Nearly one in every 100
adults in America is

237
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,680
in prison or jail.

238
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,280
That's true.

239
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,800
We have over two million
people behind bars right now.

240
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,320
We have more prisoners at the
moment than China--than China.

241
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,880
We don't have more of anything
than China, other than,

242
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,920
of course, debt to China.

243
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,920
And it didn't always
used to be this way.

244
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,920
Our prison population has
expanded eightfold since 1970.

245
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,920
The only other thing that's
grown at that rate since

246
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,400
the seventies is
varieties of Cheerios.

247
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,560
Fuck you, fruity Cheerios!

248
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,800
You're trumped-up Froot
Loops, and you know it.

249
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,880
And look, look.

250
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,960
Our prison population
has exploded for a number

251
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,760
of reasons, from the dismantling of our

252
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,680
mental-health system to
mandatory minimum sentence

253
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,480
laws which help explain why
97% of people plead guilty to

254
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,840
federal crimes rather than
risk going to trial to,

255
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,720
of course, drugs.

256
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,600
Because half the people in
federal prison are there

257
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,160
on drug charges, and it
accounts for a quarter

258
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,920
of admissions to
state prisons.

259
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,880
And of course it's tricky to
know how to feel about all

260
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,000
this because on the one
hand, the war on drugs has

261
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,800
completely solved our nation's
drug problem, so that's good.

262
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,080
But on the other hand, our
drug laws do seem to be

263
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,200
a little draconian and a lot
racist, because while white

264
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,640
people and African Americans
use drugs about the same

265
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,520
amount, a study has found that
African Americans have been

266
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,880
sent to prison for drug
offenses at up to 10 times

267
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,360
the rate for some utterly
known reason.

268
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,120
It reminds me--it
reminds me of a joke.

269
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,800
You know, black people who
commit drug offenses, they go

270
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,240
to jail like this, whereas white people don't go to

271
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,960
jail at all.

272
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,760
In fact, so many people--so
many people are incarcerated

273
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,200
in America right now that it's
become one of the things that

274
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,600
"Sesame Street" has to
explain to children.

275
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,760
My dad is...

276
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,080
my dad is in jail.

277
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,960
When I was about your age,
my dad was incarcerated, too.

278
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,480
Incarcerated is when someone
breaks the law, a grown-up

279
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,680
rule, and then they have to
go to jail or prison.

280
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,760
We will be your friend

281
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,560
We'll help you through

282
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,840
You're not alone

283
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,640
Just think about that.

284
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,920
We now need adorable singing
puppets to explain prison to

285
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,280
children in the same way that
they explain the number 7 or

286
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,960
what the moon is.

287
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,840
And at least "Sesame Street"
is actually talking

288
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,200
about prison.

289
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,200
The rest of us are much
happier completely ignoring it,

290
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,720
perhaps because it's
so easy not to care

291
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,800
about prisoners.

292
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,800
They are by definition
convicted criminals.

293
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,800
In fact, it's so easy not
to care that we are really

294
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,160
comfortable making jokes about
one of the most horrifying

295
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,960
things that can
potentially happen to them.

296
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,480
Go directly to jail.

297
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,840
Do not pass go.

298
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,280
Do not collect $200, and
do not, I repeat, do not

299
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,240
drop the soap.

300
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,560
Help!

301
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,280
No!

302
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,320
Look.

303
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,960
Doubloons.

304
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,840
Don't drop 'em.

305
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,240
You know what?

306
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,520
If we were in prison, you guys
would be, like, my bitches.

307
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,880
We're going to federal
pound-me-in-the-ass prison.

308
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,200
Puss, you got any idea
what they do to eggs

309
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,080
in San Ricardo Prison?

310
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,800
It ain't over easy.

311
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,960
Oh.

312
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,960
Ohh.

313
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,880
Do you get it?
Do you get it?

314
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,200
The egg is gonna get
fucked against its will.

315
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,640
That's why it's funny.

316
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,360
Wake up your children and
explain that joke to them.

317
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,480
They'll love it.

318
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,160
Dooh.

319
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,520
We are somehow collectively
able to laugh about references

320
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,720
to the fact that 4% of
prisoners reported being

321
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,120
sexually victimized
in the past year.

322
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,720
One in 25.

323
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,600
Now, that might not sound
like a lot, but think of it

324
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,960
like this.

325
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,960
If every time you bought two
dozen doughnuts, one of them

326
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,080
had been raped, you'd be
pretty upset, and those

327
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,160
are pastries.

328
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,320
Prisoners are people.

329
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,160
If you don't know a prisoner,
though, or think that you're

330
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,040
ever likely to become one,
then their safety and health

331
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,400
is not gonna be high on
your list of priorities.

332
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,320
You don't need to know
anything about the conditions

333
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,600
that they live in.

334
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,920
But you know who should know?

335
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,960
Maybe the Director of Federal
Prisons, and yet, watch him

336
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,960
almost comically struggle
to recall a basic detail

337
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,560
about one of the most mentally
excruciating things prisoners

338
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,640
can be subjected to:
solitary confinement.

339
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,520
How big is a cell?

340
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,440
How big is the average
cell in solitary?

341
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,880
You say the average size?

342
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,720
FRANKEN: Cell. Yeah,
the size of the cell.

343
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,960
How big is it?

344
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,880
What is--I'm trying to
get--this is a human thing

345
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,080
we're talking about.

346
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,400
We've got a lot of statistics.

347
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,040
How big is the cell?

348
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,960
The average size of
a cell is...

349
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,960
I guess I'm trying to--you're
looking for the space

350
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,880
of what the--

351
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:37,480
FRANKEN: Yes, the dimensions
in feet and inches, the size

352
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,800
of the cell that a
person is kept in.

353
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I want to get some
idea of--I don't know.

354
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,640
Am I asking this wrong?

355
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,520
No. No, you're not.

356
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,600
You are not asking it wrong.

357
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
As far as I can remember,
you're just asking him what

358
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,200
the size of the
fucking cell is.

359
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,920
But it was a long time ago, and to be fair, he did

360
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,280
eventually get an answer.

361
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:11,880
The average size should
be equivalent to 6 x 4.

362
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,360
What? 6 x 4?

363
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,400
A couple of things there.

364
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,640
One, that was clearly a guess.

365
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,080
And two, 6 x 4 is
barely an elevator.

366
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,400
That is the length of a
6-foot party sub by the length

367
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,720
of the amount of that party
sub that's left over

368
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,240
the following day because
nobody wants party subs.

369
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,600
People put their
hands all over them.

370
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,640
They're disgusting.

371
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,920
No, that's not the point.

372
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,920
That's not the point.

373
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,920
But thankfully, a few
minutes later, the record

374
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,760
was corrected.

375
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,720
MAN: For the--actually it's
10 x 7 for the cell size.

376
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,840
Ooh. 10 x 7.

377
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,800
Step this way, your highness.

378
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,920
Plenty of room for a ping-pong
table and an imaginary

379
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,440
opponent as your mind
slowly becomes untethered.

380
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,960
What is clear so far is that
we are doing a terrible job

381
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,520
of taking care of people that
it is very easy for all of us

382
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,960
not to care about,
but here's the thing.

383
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,600
Increasingly, we aren't
taking care of them at all.

384
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,760
Private subcontractors have
steadily been taking over

385
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,880
certain services, like the
Aramark Corporation, who

386
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,720
provide food to prisons and
a promise that "With Aramack,

387
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,240
you can expect
more--more savings."

388
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,880
And hey, look.

389
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,880
When you're being thrifty with
food costs, what's the worst

390
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,120
that can happen?

391
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,840
WOMAN: Records show 65
instances where Aramark

392
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,920
employees failed to
provide food or ran out.

393
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,200
DIFFERENT WOMAN: The private
vendor Aramark changed recipes

394
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,840
to include cheaper, sometimes
substandard ingredients.

395
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,160
Aramark Correctional Services
made headlines recently after

396
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,400
maggots were found in food
served at prisons here

397
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
in Michigan.

398
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,120
That is not good.

399
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,640
The only time when you are
happy to hear the words

400
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,000
"maggots were found" is when
you are a maggot whose family

401
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,480
was lost at sea.

402
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,040
"We floated 3 days on a
piece of bread, but we never

403
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,360
lost hope."

404
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,640
And it's not just
food being privatized.

405
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,160
It's prison health care, too.

406
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,920
Arizona tried that.

407
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,360
Guess how it turned out.

408
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,320
MAN: Medical spending in prisons

409
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,920
dropped by $30 million,

410
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,000
and staffing levels plummeted.

411
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,080
50 people died in Arizona

412
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,280
Department of Corrections

413
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,960
custody in just the first

414
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,520
8 months of this year.

415
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,680
Compare that to 37 deaths in

416
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,160
the previous 2 years combined.

417
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,520
50 deaths?

418
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,320
At this point, you could hire
the people who pretend to be

419
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,160
doctors on "Grey's Anatomy,"
and you would probably have

420
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,280
a lower mortality rate
and a lot more intrigue.

421
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,960
Hmm. Cutting costs has led
to some incredible things

422
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,440
happening in Arizona.

423
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,080
One prisoner had a C-section
in jail, and this is how she

424
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,120
says they treated her.

425
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,960
They decided to use
sugar, kitchen sugar.

426
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,240
What do you mean, they
used kitchen sugar?

427
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,400
The packets, like
McDonald's, the sugar.

428
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,800
They would open it,
pour it inside,

429
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,560
and put gauze over it
and tape it up,

430
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,520
and they had to do
that for, like, 3 weeks.

431
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,000
And they poured them
in your C-section.

432
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,120
Yeah.

433
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,200
Did they tell you why
they were doing that?

434
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,200
One of the doctors
learned it from--

435
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,760
I don't even know.

436
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,760
I don't know.

437
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,560
Basically it's
a home remedy.

438
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,720
MAN: Sugar was used to treat
wounds before the advent

439
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,840
of antibiotics back
in the early 1900s.

440
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,800
Yeah, but then we all decided
it was no longer an acceptable

441
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,440
medical practice, like curing
a child's cough with heroin.

442
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,920
"But look. He's not
coughing anymore."

443
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,800
"Yeah, he's not really doing
much of anything anymore,

444
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,960
and I can't find any
of the good silver."

445
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,920
But look, look.

446
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,360
You will never pay a political
price for treating prisoners

447
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,920
like this woman badly.

448
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,320
You don't even need
to pretend to care.

449
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,920
Here is how one Arizona
lawmaker responded to

450
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,440
her story.

451
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,920
That doesn't sound like
a true allegation.

452
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,960
That sounds ridiculous.

453
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,320
You know, prisoners have
24/7 to think up allegations

454
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,680
and write letters.

455
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,480
I'm not saying that some
of them can't have a basis

456
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,360
in fact, but you've got
to take them with a grain

457
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,120
of salt, or in the case
of the hospital, maybe

458
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,120
a grain of sugar.

459
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,080
AUDIENCE: Oh!

460
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,400
Somewhere in hell, Satan
just sharpened his pitchfork

461
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,840
and said to his secretary, "Do
me a favor, Janice, and let me

462
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,280
"know when that guy
gets here, OK?

463
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,440
I just want to be ready."

464
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,240
Many states are
even contracting out

465
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,880
entire prisons.

466
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,360
Nearly 9% of prisons are
currently run by private

467
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,880
firms, like GEO Group and
Corrections Corporation

468
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,680
of America, who had combined
revenues of over $3 billion

469
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,840
last year.

470
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,920
They're publicly traded,
and while their marketing

471
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,000
materials emphasize how much they do to help their

472
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,440
prisoners rebuild their lives,
their pitch to investors has

473
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,840
been a little bit different.

474
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,160
WOMAN: In a recent investor
presentation, CCA pitches its

475
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,520
unique investment opportunity.

476
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,200
Another reason investing in
the jailing of people makes

477
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,880
good financial sense?

478
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,880
High recidivism.

479
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,760
Oh, that's--that is
a great way to reassure

480
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,840
your investors.

481
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,760
"Look, look, look.
We see your concerns.

482
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,640
"You know, what if we fully
rehabilitate the prisoners

483
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,840
"and they become fully
functional members of society?

484
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,280
"Well, don't worry.

485
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,880
"That's not the kind of
company we're running here.

486
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,240
"Don't worry.

487
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,120
"Once we're done with these
prisoners, they're like human

488
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,360
"boomerangs: they're broken
right in the middle, and they

489
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,760
keep coming back."

490
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,880
The key problem with running
prisons as businesses is that

491
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,880
prisons are then
run as businesses.

492
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,440
Pay and staffing ratios are
so much lower that a GEO Group

493
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,880
youth facility in Mississippi
sometimes had just two

494
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,720
officers overseeing as
many as 256 prisoners.

495
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,960
That facility eventually
closed, but only after

496
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,200
a federal judge wrote that
physical and sexual abuse was

497
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,800
rampant there because its
operators had "allowed

498
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,720
"a cesspool of unconstitutional
and inhuman acts

499
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,600
and conditions to germinate."

500
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,640
Now, I know that GEO will say
that presents an unbalanced

501
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,120
picture of their company, so
in the interest of balance, I

502
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,960
will point out that they
got an award from the state

503
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,240
of Florida citing their "bold
and innovative cost saving

504
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,840
business practices."

505
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,600
Although I think we all know,
when the state of Florida

506
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,920
gives you an award, that
award is basically sarcastic.

507
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,560
In fact, a quick side note,
the award was signed by

508
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,040
Florida governor Rick
Scott, who has led the drive

509
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,320
for prison privatization
in his state, but

510
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,520
on one condition.

511
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,440
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

512
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,520
Listen, if you think Rick
Scott is going to look the

513
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,840
other way for a company with a
history of the physical abuse

514
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,280
of minors for savings of a
mere 6%, you don't know Rick

515
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,760
Scott, OK?

516
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,360
Ricky needs 7.
Ricky wants 7.

517
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,840
Ricky likes 7, OK?

518
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,400
Now, if you happen, at all, to
be interested in asking Rick

519
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,960
Scott about the conduct of the
GEO Group, for goodness sake,

520
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,840
don't do it tomorrow night.

521
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,120
He's busy.

522
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,240
We actually checked, and he's
going to be at a fundraiser

523
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,160
at the home of--and this is
true--the CEO of GEO Group.

524
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,240
I believe the theme of that
fundraiser is "a cesspool

525
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,160
of unconstitutional
and inhumane acts."

526
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:49,800
Look, this is--this is
all so depressing.

527
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,840
Private prisons are bad, yes,
but the whole system just

528
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,320
seems fundamentally broken.

529
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,520
You know what?

530
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,320
I think, if you don't
mind, I need a minute.

531
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,240
I actually need some help
understanding this, if you

532
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:09,240
don't mind.

533
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,960
Hey, John.
You seem sad.

534
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,800
Yeah.

535
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,280
I am sad, Timmy.

536
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,800
It's just I've been looking
at the prison conditions

537
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,440
in America, and the
whole system is just

538
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,440
so horribly broken.

539
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,440
Mmm.

540
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,040
Yeah. I know
what you mean.

541
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,520
My daddy's in jail
right now

542
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,040
for a low-level
drug offense.

543
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,960
You see, that's exactly what
I'm talking about, Timmy.

544
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,000
That's crazy.

545
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,960
Well, my daddy's
in jail

546
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,680
because he killed
4 people.

547
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,080
Yeah, well, OK.

548
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,320
He's actually a dangerous
individual who needs to be

549
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,240
in jail, so that's not
really the same thing.

550
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,920
My daddy's in jail, and
people pay money to see him.

551
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,360
Yeah, that's
actually a zoo.

552
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,920
That's different.

553
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,880
He's in a zoo, OK?

554
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,120
It looks the same
to him.

555
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,280
Well, let's not
conflate the two.

556
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,360
Oh, he's gone. OK.

557
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,640
Hey, John, how
badly broken

558
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,640
is the prison
system?

559
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,840
Yeah.

560
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,160
Well, I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

561
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,480
but one prison actually put sugar in
a woman's C-section.

562
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,880
Oh!

563
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,880
Wait a second.

564
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,880
What's
a C-section?

565
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,640
Oh, boy. Um...
Yeah.

566
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,800
Oh, wait, wait.
You mean, like,

567
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,960
the letter C?

568
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,960
OLIVER: Yes. Yes, yes,
that's what I mean.

569
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,080
That's exactly
what I mean. Yeah.

570
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,840
Mr. Oliver, would it make
you feel better if we

571
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,160
sing about it?

572
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,920
Well, it can't hurt,
can it?

573
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,920
Yeah!

574
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,960
OLIVER: Let's do that.
Yeah, why not?

575
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,840
We're singing
about issues.

576
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,960
OK.
Yeah.

577
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,840
It's a fact that needs
to be spoken

578
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,000
America's prisons
are broken

579
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,840
It's a hard truth
about incarceration

580
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,240
Prisons are needed
for a civilization

581
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,440
But mandatory minimums
for heroin and crack

582
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,040
Stack the system against
Hispanics and blacks

583
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,800
Our prison population
is bigger than Slovenia

584
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,040
Have we put
people in jail

585
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,040
Instead of treating
schizophrenia?

586
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,040
OLIVER: It's true.

587
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,240
I know. They put
my dad in jail

588
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,360
because they say he's a monster.

589
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,520
Oh, what did he do?

590
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,560
Nothing.

591
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,200
They just said he
looked like a monster.

592
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,960
Well, that's
racial profiling,

593
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,400
and that's
wrong, too, OK?

594
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,560
Yeah.
Ooh.

595
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,480
It's a fact that needs
to be spoken

596
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,960
America's prisons
are broken

597
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,320
Prison conditions are
a national disgrace

598
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,400
With violence

599
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,520
And maggots

600
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,800
And possibly rapes

601
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,880
And we shouldn't lock up
reptiles just to look

602
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,040
At their face

603
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,400
Those are zoos.
Those are zoos.

604
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,640
Your dad is an
alligator in a zoo.

605
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,840
I'm a crocodile.
I'm a crocodile.

606
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,280
Oh, Jesus,
here we go.

607
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,840
Oh, boy.

608
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,120
Oh, we all look
alike, right?

609
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,800
No, no, that's not
what I'm saying.

610
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,360
That's not what I'm saying.

611
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,040
No, no. You can't
put that on me.

612
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,920
That is clearly not what
I was saying.

613
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,560
That's
so ignorant.

614
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,640
Oh, come on.

615
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,040
As we were
saying...

616
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,800
It's a fact that
needs to be spoken

617
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,480
America's prisons
are broken

618
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,320
America's broken
prison system

619
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,920
is brought to you
by decades of neglect...

620
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,800
a lack of political
courage...

621
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,680
and a generous donation
by the GEO Group...

622
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,600
as well as viewers like you.

623
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,760
Yes! Yay!
Whoo hoo!

624
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,840
We did it.

625
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,960
That's our show.

626
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,640
Thank you so much
for watching.

627
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,400
Thank you to all of my
friends on the stoop.

628
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,560
We'll be back next Sunday.

629
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,960
Please have a happier week.

630
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,920
Good night!

631
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,960
We did it!
We did it!

632
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,920
Let's dance the show out, OK?

633
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:37,640
Let's dance.

634
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,640
Well done. I'm sorry.

635
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,800
I'm sorry about the...
