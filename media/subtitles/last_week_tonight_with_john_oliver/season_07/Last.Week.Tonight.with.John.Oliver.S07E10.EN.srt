00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,190
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,350
SEASON VII
EPISODE 10

3
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,990
Hello there !
Welcome again to this white void,

4
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,070
which I've just realized,
I've never given you a proper tour of !

5
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,630
Let me quickly show you around.
This is the white. This is the void.

6
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,630
And this is where I keep
my generalized anxiety

7
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,950
about society's uncertain future
and my own unavoidable mortality.

8
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,790
It's hard to believe a space could
simultaneously feel so empty

9
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,670
and yet so crushingly full.

10
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,510
It's been another grim week,
with news of the global pandemic

11
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,550
broken up only by further developments
surrounding Tara Reade,

12
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,030
the former Senate aide who's accused
Joe Biden of sexual assault.

13
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,030
Now, he's denied that claim,

14
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,950
but there are clearly big questions
still to be answered here.

15
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,150
Tara Reade deserves to be heard,

16
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:07,030
the way that anyone does
when they make the difficult choice

17
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,070
to come forward
with allegations of this kind

18
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,670
allegations which should
be fully investigated.

19
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,550
And I am sure that we will talk
more about this as the story unfolds.

20
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,510
But for now, let's move on
to our main story tonight,

21
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,070
which yet again
concerns the coronavirus.

22
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,990
Very much
the Timothee Chalamet of viruses,

23
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,510
in that you barely
had time to learn its name

24
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,150
before, suddenly,
it was fucking everywhere.

25
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,470
It's been another tough week.
Everyone is desperate to get outside

26
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,470
perhaps no one more than Alex Jones,
who's gone from leading protests

27
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,910
against stay-at-home orders
at the Texas capitol, to this.

28
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,710
I'll admit it,
I will eat my neighbors.

29
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,870
I'm not letting my kids die.
My superpower is being honest.

30
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,750
I have extrapolated this out

31
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,270
and I won't have to for a few years
'cause I got food and stuff,

32
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,470
but I'm literally looking
at my neighbors now and going,

33
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,590
I'm ready to hang them up and gut
'em and skin 'em and chop 'em up.

34
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,950
I'm ready.
My daughters aren't starving to death.

35
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,350
I'll eat my neighbors.

36
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:08,150
See, my superpower is being honest.
I'll eat your ass.

37
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,270
There is a lot to unpack there.

38
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,910
Obviously,
there's the ass-eating promise.

39
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,710
But even before that, he's threatening
to feed his neighbors to his daughters

40
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,310
which is weird enough before
you consider he also has a son.

41
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,390
What about him, A.J. ?

42
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,110
Why doesn't he get to eat
any human flesh ?

43
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,990
And finally, Alex Jones is making plans
to desperately devour his neighbors

44
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,590
several years out
while also wearing an $8,000 watch.

45
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,430
I'd maybe at least consider selling that
or, I don't know-planting a garden,

46
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,830
before stooping to actual cannibalism.

47
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,750
But look,
things are clearly dire right now.

48
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,270
The coronavirus death toll
is currently over 60,000 in the U.S.

49
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,830
In three months, it's killed more
Americans than the Vietnam War.

50
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,030
Which is a truly grim milestone.

51
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,670
And that is what made it
so jarring to see Jared Kushner

52
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,310
and his resting
"Do you know who my father is ?" face

53
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,550
basically declare victory
over the virus on Wednesday.

54
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,950
The government rose to the challenge
and this is a great success story.

55
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,950
And I think that that's really
what needs to be told.

56
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,550
I think you'll see by June a lot of the
country should be back to normal

57
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,310
and the hope is, is that by July,
the country is really rocking again.

58
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,150
It'll be "really rocking again",
will it, Jared ?

59
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,270
It's incredible to see someone

60
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,110
with the skin of a newborn baby
birthed in a tub of Neutrogena

61
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,190
talk like a middle-aged dad desperately
trying to connect with his teenage son.

62
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,070
But before we can celebrate
Jared's "great success story"

63
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,270
and get back to our rockin' selves,

64
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,990
we badly need to work out how
we can reopen parts of society safely.

65
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,550
And experts say
that really means one thing.

66
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,550
Every public health official
says testing, testing, testing.

67
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,110
Testing, testing, testing.

68
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,870
Testing, testing, testing.

69
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:59,510
Testing, testing, testing, testing.

70
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,390
Testing, testing, testing !

71
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,470
Yeah, good point, Patrick.

72
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,030
SpongeBob shouldn't be taking joy
rides in his open-water convertible

73
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,150
while wearing a cowboy hat
and no mask

74
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,590
until we have adequate testing
in place.

75
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,110
Absorbent and yellow
and porous is he !

76
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,310
Two out of three of those
are extremely high-risk categories.

77
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,270
So, get back in your fucking
pineapple, SpongeBob.

78
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,670
But those experts are right.
In managing a pandemic,

79
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,510
there is almost nothing more important
than widespread, effective testing.

80
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:36,270
It is your only chance of tracking and
containing the spread from the start.

81
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,190
Unfortunately, tests have been
alarmingly scarce in this country

82
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,710
despite the fact the president
has repeatedly claimed

83
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,150
that that is not the case,
even declaring in early March that,

84
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,750
"Anyone who wants a test
can get a test."

85
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,390
But that wasn't true then
and it still isn't true now,

86
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,350
as you probably know from seeing
countless stories like this.

87
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,910
Dawn Clements in Largo, Florida,
has been sick since Friday.

88
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,310
Her daughter went through it
two weeks ago.

89
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:06,430
She has all the symptoms,
no flu, and can't get tested.

90
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,590
I'm immunosuppressed
with some health conditions,

91
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,230
and I live at an A.L.F.

92
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,470
And I don't know what virus I have.

93
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,550
I'm running a fever
and I have chest congestion.

94
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,270
And nobody can test us here.

95
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:28,030
That is terrible. A woman who is
symptomatic, immunosuppressed,

96
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,270
and living in an A.L.F.

97
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,670
sounds like exactly the kind of person
that you would want to have tested.

98
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,590
Now, A.L.F., incidentally,

99
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:40,310
refers to "assisted living facility"
and not the Eighties sitcom alien.

100
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:44,110
Although, if she were living in ALF,
she should probably still get tested

101
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,510
since I've heard rumors

102
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:49,150
that this whole thing started
when someone ate a bowl of ALF soup.

103
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,550
And she's frankly far from alone,
testing has only recently,

104
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,510
months into the spread of this virus,
become more widely available.

105
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,710
Our testing failure
has been called

106
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,190
"the original sin
of America's pandemic failure".

107
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,710
Because, had testing caught
the cases in this country early,

108
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,030
we could have managed
the virus through contact tracing

109
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,830
and targeted quarantines.

110
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:14,790
But that did not happen,
so the virus spread widely,

111
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,870
forcing us to use the blunt instrument
of making everyone stay at home.

112
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,430
A lack of testing goes to the heart
of how we got into this situation.

113
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,830
And the truth is, broad testing
is our only safe way out of it.

114
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,750
While experts disagree
on the exact number of tests

115
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,070
that we need to be doing
to safely reopen,

116
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,310
the lowest estimate
is 500,000 a day,

117
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,270
with others saying a good target
would actually be 35 million a day.

118
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:44,910
And at present, we've only been
performing around 200,000 a day.

119
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,310
So, we're not even hitting
the lowest target here.

120
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,750
Think of it like this: if our goal
were to eat an Italian dinner,

121
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,110
we're currently stuck in traffic
on our way to an Olive Garden.

122
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,470
We're not halfway to arriving at the
worst place that technically qualifies.

123
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,950
So, if our testing shortage
has caused this much damage,

124
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,390
this much disruption,
and is still not fully resolved,

125
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,670
we thought tonight might be a good
time to ask: what the fuck happened ?

126
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,070
And to do that, we're gonna be looking
at two major types of tests:

127
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,830
diagnostic tests, which tell you
if you have the virus right now

128
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,270
and antibody tests, which tell you
if you've previously had it.

129
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,750
And let's start
with diagnostic tests.

130
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,430
The most common form involve having
a giant swab shoved up your nose

131
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,510
and I don't think anyone's described
the experience better than this woman.

132
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,950
My God. They just pulled my brain
out through my nostril.

133
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,630
I can taste blood.

134
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,270
That woman took my soul
out of my head with that Q-tip.

135
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,950
She actually grabbed the back
of my head, like we were lovers,

136
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,550
but instead of kissing me,
she was impaling my brain.

137
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,670
That sounds pretty unpleasant.

138
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,390
Unless your brain is being pulled out
through your nostril by Adam Driver.

139
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,310
Pull my heart out through my ear,
you meaty oak tree.

140
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,190
Impale my brain,
you unacceptable monstrosity.

141
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:16,430
Diagnostic tests are key, especially
at the beginning of an outbreak.

142
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,350
But unfortunately, the U.S. committed
some critical errors early on.

143
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,630
Because in mid-January, shortly
after this virus was discovered,

144
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,230
the World Health Organization

145
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,790
recommended
a diagnostic testing protocol.

146
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:32,030
But, rather than follow it,
the CDC decided to develop its own,

147
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:36,390
more complicated test
which wasn't inherently a bad idea.

148
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:40,470
Unfortunately, though, they chose
to manufacture testing kits themselves.

149
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:44,270
And as those kits were shipped
around the country in early February,

150
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,830
it became clear that, due to chemical
contamination during manufacturing,

151
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,950
the tests didn't work properly.

152
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,150
And that was already bad.

153
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,710
But, what made it worse
was the CDC then took weeks

154
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,230
to come up with a workaround
that would make them usable.

155
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:03,950
And just losing days in a pandemic,
when a virus can spread exponentially,

156
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,390
is a huge problem.

157
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:09,750
Losing an entire month
is absolutely catastrophic.

158
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:14,150
And what's particularly frustrating here
is that some private sector labs

159
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,510
were willing to jump in
and develop their own tests.

160
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,310
But throughout February,
they were slowed down

161
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,750
by having to jump through
bureaucratic hoops like this.

162
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:25,110
One of the things is they needed
a document FedExed across the country

163
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,270
before they could look
at the document.

164
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,950
You couldn't electronically
transmit it ?

165
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,190
I could, but they couldn't
look at it until it was FedExed.

166
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,630
Then they changed that regulation.
From a couple days after February 4th

167
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,670
all the way to February 26th,
they didn't have a test.

168
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,910
They were completely blind, too.

169
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,750
- It had to be incredibly frustrating.
- It was frustrating. It was.

170
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:47,190
Yeah, I bet it was.
In fact, the FDA suggested to him

171
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,430
that he send a printed paper
hard copy of the submission,

172
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:54,430
and a CD or thumb drive
with an electronic copy.

173
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,550
And where would you even find
a blank CD ?

174
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,990
At a Walgreens 20 years ago ?

175
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:05,590
Or, does the FDA really expect everyone
to burn over "Road Jamz 2005" ?

176
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:09,510
Because no fucking way, FDA !
That's a classic mix right there !

177
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,630
It's got all the songs
from "American Idiot",

178
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,470
in the order that they appeared
on "American Idiot",

179
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,750
but better because they were
stolen off LimeWire.

180
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,510
And while that requirement
was quickly lifted,

181
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,390
it was just one of many logistical
and bureaucratic challenges

182
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,750
that slowed things down
at the worst possible time.

183
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,070
In fact, it wasn't
until the last day of February

184
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:33,670
that the FDA did something that private
labs have been begging them to do

185
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,710
and allowed those labs to develop
and use their own tests

186
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,790
without waiting for authorization.

187
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,550
But by that point,
a whole month had gone by

188
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,470
and, incredibly,
we'd only tested-in the whole country

189
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,030
472 people, in total.

190
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,550
That is it. Even as,
as we've since learned,

191
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:56,350
the virus was spreading undetected
in multiple major cities.

192
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,030
Now, by contrast,
on the exact same date, South Korea,

193
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:05,350
which has 1/6 our population,
had completed 55,000 tests.

194
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,350
Alex Azar, the Secretary
of Health and Human Services,

195
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,390
didn't seem too concerned
about that disparity,

196
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,150
because watch how he responded
when he was asked about it.

197
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,590
My question is why was South Korea
able to do this in a week

198
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,110
and it seems to be such a struggle
for the United States ?

199
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:24,430
It's not about ability,
it's about what they needed to do.

200
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,150
They had an explosive,
immediate outburst and cluster

201
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,030
becoming one of the world's
epicenters of the disease.

202
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,350
We are not that.

203
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,310
Yeah, we're not South Korea !

204
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,910
South Korea has tested a bunch
of people for coronavirus

205
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,990
and found a bunch of people
with coronavirus.

206
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,430
We've tested
almost no one for coronavirus

207
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,830
and found almost
no one with coronavirus.

208
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,510
To the best of our knowledge, the
situations could not be more different.

209
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,070
Although, again, the best of our
knowledge is essentially no knowledge.

210
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,510
For too long the U.S.
response seemed to be characterized

211
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,950
by an arrogant belief
that, for some reason,

212
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,630
coronavirus virus was never gonna
come to America

213
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,950
because, I guess,
it just wouldn't dare.

214
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,910
Unfortunately, we're living in the
consequences of those early failures.

215
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,070
Because by moving so slowly,
we now find ourselves

216
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:15,030
in the midst of serious global
shortages of testing components.

217
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,590
Just listen to the scientist
that you saw earlier

218
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,870
explain the lengths
that he's had to go to

219
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,550
in order to get what he needed
from the test manufacturer, Roche.

220
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,790
One of the hardest things to find:
the single-use plastic tips

221
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,590
that contain the chemicals
and the specimens.

222
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,550
This is what we're looking for.

223
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,830
We tweeted at Roche
and the world to get these things in,

224
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,150
like Delta had lost your bags
or something like that, right ?

225
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,950
Holy shit !

226
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,910
You should not have to tweet

227
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,990
at a company to get parts
for essential lab equipment.

228
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,470
Not only should there be
a better process for that

229
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,230
but, also,
that's just not what Twitter is for.

230
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,150
As we all know, Twitter
is for exactly three things:

231
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,270
Possum Every Hour, Chrissy Teigen,
and the official account for beef.

232
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,750
And if you don't follow that,
you absolutely should.

233
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,710
Because that's where you can
find tweets like "Nicely done, beef."

234
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,510
Which is beef tweeting
encouragement at beef

235
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:11,110
and a level of unconditional self-love
that more of us should aspire to.

236
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,670
And you can also find
their actual Mother's Day tweet,

237
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,710
"To the moms who wrangled
us, fed us and cared for us,

238
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,430
we wish you a hashtag
#HappyMothersDay !"

239
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,830
with a picture
of a mother cow and a baby cow

240
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,590
who will both presumably
one day become beef,

241
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,950
at which point, I'm pretty sure the
account will tweet, "Nicely done, beef."

242
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,230
And it's not just lab equipment, here.

243
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,030
Even the chemical reagents
needed to run the tests

244
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:39,070
or the swabs that impale people's brains
have to be specially manufactured,

245
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,670
something that the president
seemed absolutely fascinated by.

246
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,830
It's a swab.

247
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,790
It looks innocent.
Not very complicated.

248
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:52,510
Does it remind you of something ?
It reminds you of this, right ?

249
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,190
One's a swab, one's a Q-tip.
It's actually different.

250
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,070
It's very sophisticated, actually.

251
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,990
But it's a little bit like,
so this is the swab.

252
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,630
Yeah, that's the swab. Obviously.

253
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,910
And the back story to him
deciding to personally bring a Q-tip

254
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,910
to that briefing to proudly show
everyone is so painfully obvious.

255
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,590
Someone showed him the long swab
and he said, "Isn't that a Q-tip ?"

256
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,430
And they said, "No, they're different."
And he said, "But they look the same."

257
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,070
They said, "No, they don't."

258
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,390
He said, "But they're both tall, thin,
and white, like all my girlfriends."

259
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,830
They said, "Good one, Mr. President."
He said, "So, what's the problem ?"

260
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,430
They said, "They're not the same."

261
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,630
He said, "But they're both tall, thin,
and white, like all my girlfriends."

262
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,790
They said, "Good one again."
He said, "So, what gives ?"

263
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,550
They said, "Here's a Q-tip."
And he said, "That one is short,"

264
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,870
"thin, and white, like my girlfriends
when they were children."

265
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,030
They said: "Exactly."
He said: "I have to tell America."

266
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,230
And then he did.

267
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,190
But second,
and much more importantly,

268
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,790
for months, things like swabs
were very hard to find

269
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:57,310
and multiple governors expressed
distress that the federal government

270
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,470
was not stepping in to help
smooth out the supply chain.

271
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,870
There are shortages on swabs,
that we don't have anywhere in America.

272
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,750
Can't do the tests
without them.

273
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,710
We need assistance
from the federal government

274
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,550
when it comes
to swabs and reagents.

275
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:15,110
We've been fighting for testing.
It's not a straightforward test.

276
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:18,070
We don't even have enough
swabs, believe it or not.

277
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,710
To do the testing
you need testing equipment.

278
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:26,550
You need swabs, you need vials.
And you need all of these things

279
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,750
at a capacity
that does not now exist.

280
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,270
Yeah, it's pretty straightforward.

281
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,190
To do proper testing,
you need proper equipment.

282
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,030
It's why, generally, you prefer
a doctor with a thermometer

283
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,550
over one who just thinks he has
a real natural knack

284
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,710
for guessing
a person's temperature.

285
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,350
In response to those concerns,
Trump initially claimed

286
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,310
that the problems those governors
were experiencing simply didn't exist.

287
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,870
We're in great shape.
It's so easy to get.

288
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,030
Reagents and swabs
are so easy to get.

289
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,470
Mr. President, you said:
"Swabs are easy".

290
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,710
This has been something that hospitals
and the states have been saying

291
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,550
there are shortages
for more than a month now.

292
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,110
We have millions of 'em
coming in very soon.

293
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,190
Many already
have been ordered

294
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,470
and the governors don't know
quite where they are,

295
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,990
they'll be finding 'em
fairly soon.

296
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,550
They'll be finding them
fairly soon ?

297
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:19,190
These are crucial medical supplies
in the midst of a pandemic,

298
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,110
not a fucking scavenger hunt.

299
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:24,150
"The swabs are on me,
where imaginations run wild."

300
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,190
"Each level I have,
the pages are piled."

301
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,750
Where imaginations run wild
and the pages are piled...

302
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,670
A bookshelf ! The swabs for nationwide
diagnostic testing are on a bookshelf !

303
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,590
I did it ! Wait !
Why is this a fucking game ?

304
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,790
Trump did eventually invoke
the Defense Production Act

305
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,830
to ramp up manufacturing of swabs,
but he did it late.

306
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,670
Again, timing
is absolutely everything here.

307
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:50,070
From the start,
the story of diagnostic testing

308
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,950
is of us making mistakes and
wasting valuable time in fixing them,

309
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,430
meaning tests were heavily rationed
and often only given to people

310
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,390
who met extremely narrow criteria.

311
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:03,590
Which makes it especially frustrating
that, in his victory lap this week,

312
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,510
Jared Kushner said this.

313
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,710
Somebody asked me
why it took so long.

314
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,510
I said: "You should look at how
did we do this so quickly."

315
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:13,190
And what's happened
is truly extraordinary.

316
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:17,030
No, it fucking isn't, Jared.
Taking months to do

317
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,350
what other countries did in weeks
is not extraordinary.

318
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,270
The only thing
that's extraordinary here

319
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:25,270
is that the most punchable face
in America somehow looks

320
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,670
like it's never been touched
by human hands.

321
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,630
Does it just absorb fists
like a bowl of heavy cream ?

322
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,630
What's your secret,
you translucent sociopath ?

323
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,510
The failures in diagnostic testing
have led us to our current situation,

324
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,590
where we still don't know
how many people in this country

325
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,350
have or have had the coronavirus.

326
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,310
You may have even
found yourself wondering:

327
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,630
"Did I have it earlier this year ?
I had that cough."

328
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,070
"I did feel a bit sick.
Was that it ?"

329
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,990
That brings us to antibody tests,
which detect whether your body

330
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,830
produced the antibodies
that fight the coronavirus.

331
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,590
Finding out if people have those
is helpful for public health officials,

332
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,510
as it gives them a better sense
of where the virus has traveled

333
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,550
and how many people
have recovered.

334
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,350
On an individual level,

335
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,630
you have to be very careful
when talking about antibodies.

336
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,670
Because too often,
the shorthand is:

337
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,750
"If you have them,
you're immune."

338
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,470
Here is Governor Cuomo
doing exactly that.

339
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,470
That would mean
that you're no longer contagious

340
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,030
and you can't catch the virus

341
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,990
because you have the antibodies
in your system.

342
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,230
Which means
you can get to work,

343
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,350
you can go back to school,
you can do whatever you want.

344
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,070
I can do whatever I want ?
That sounds great, governor !

345
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,510
I, for one, would absolutely love
the opportunity

346
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,030
to have my current panic attacks
outdoors.

347
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,590
Sometimes you want the walls
to close in on you only figuratively

348
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,830
and that's okay.

349
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,030
It would obviously be great

350
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:55,310
if the presence of antibodies meant
that you were immune from reinfection.

351
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,910
There is a good chance
that it does mean that,

352
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,150
but we don't know that yet.

353
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:04,350
Because Covid-19 is still so new,
we're still not sure exactly

354
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:08,190
what antibody levels might be needed
to make you hypothetically immune,

355
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,270
how strong that immunity would be
or how long it might even last.

356
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,390
And to his credit, Anthony Fauci
is constantly trying to point this out.

357
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,550
We do not know exactly
what an antibody titer means.

358
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,630
There's an assumption,
a reasonable assumption,

359
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:28,070
that when you have an antibody, that
you are protected against reinfection.

360
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,390
But that has not been proven
for this particular virus.

361
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,710
Yeah. And just because
something is probably true

362
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,910
doesn't mean you can automatically
assume that it is.

363
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,110
Did Nintendo create
and release Covid-19 as part of a plan

364
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:44,350
to boost sales of Animal Crossing
to a newly-captive audience ?

365
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:48,030
We don't know for sure, do we ?
We all basically agree,

366
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,990
but we can't say it
with any certainty... yet.

367
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,270
Antibody tests could actually
mean significantly less right now

368
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,430
than people
understandably want them to.

369
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,630
And that is assuming
that they're even accurate,

370
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,310
which is not necessarily the case.

371
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,190
Because while the FDA clearly

372
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:08,030
slowed things down far too much
when it came to diagnostic tests,

373
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,870
they overcorrected hard
when it came to antibody tests,

374
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:16,110
giving a green light to make tests
with essentially no oversight.

375
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,910
As a result, there are now
over 150 of them on the market,

376
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,430
none of which
are FDA approved.

377
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,550
Only 10 are even FDA "authorized",

378
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,550
which means little more than
that some forms have been submitted.

379
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,750
Researchers who've looked
at tests have found that,

380
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:37,430
while a few are reliable,
many, many more just are not.

381
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,910
We have the Wild Wild West
for testing right now.

382
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,550
The FDA has all but given up

383
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:44,870
its oversight responsibility
for the tests we have on the market.

384
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,590
Many of 'em are nothing short
of a disaster.

385
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:51,310
If you were to test for antibody
in most places in the United States,

386
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,550
over half the tests
would be false positives.

387
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:57,910
Think about what he just said there.
Many of the tests are garbage

388
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,950
and over half of the positive
test results would be wrong.

389
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,590
At that point,
why not just have people go

390
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:07,310
to a "Guess Your Coronavirus
Antibody Level" booth ?

391
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,870
Just five bucks and Jim,
here, will guess yours.

392
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,350
If he's wrong, and there's
basically no way of knowing if he is,

393
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,350
then you get a stuffed giraffe !

394
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,110
Here we are,
months into this crisis,

395
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:22,550
still badly in need of more testing,
both diagnostic and antibody,

396
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:27,110
and yet, without any clear, coordinated
strategy for how to best achieve that.

397
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:31,790
Not only has the president repeatedly
lied about the availability of tests,

398
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,910
he's still fucking doing it.

399
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:38,070
He's saying that our testing capacity
is sufficient to reopen the country.

400
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,990
Which, remember,
according to experts, it isn't.

401
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:45,630
We're doing around 200 000 tests a day
when we likely need millions.

402
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,310
And yet, on Tuesday, the president
insisted that we're just about there.

403
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,150
Some health experts say

404
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:58,750
the U.S. needs five million tests per
day by June in order to safely reopen.

405
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:02,030
You unveiled a plan yesterday
that will increase testing,

406
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,390
but not by that much.

407
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,710
Why not ? And can
you get to that benchmark ?

408
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:09,790
It will increase it by much more
than that in the very near future.

409
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,950
You say you're confident you can
surpass five million tests per day ?

410
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,350
We're gonna be there very soon.

411
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:21,070
If you look at the numbers, it could
be that we're getting very close.

412
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:26,110
But the thing is, we're not very close.
In fact, we're not close at all.

413
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:29,390
And that is a lie that
he's gonna get instantly caught on.

414
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,270
It's like someone claiming that
they have a 10-inch penis

415
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,790
immediately before
taking off their underwear.

416
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,310
That's an undeniably impressive claim.
But if you're lying,

417
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,670
I'm gonna be very disappointed and
angry you thought I wouldn't notice.

418
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,230
And sure enough,
that very day,

419
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:48,110
Trump's assistant
secretary of health told reporters:

420
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:52,470
"There is absolutely no way on Earth,
on this planet or any other planet,"

421
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:57,110
"that we can do 20 million tests
a day, or even 5 million tests a day."

422
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,630
Some confusion is inevitable

423
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,270
when a new disease starts
spreading its way around the world.

424
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,550
It's not like rolling out
testing on this kind of a scale

425
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:08,230
was ever gonna be easy,
but again and again,

426
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:12,310
the people in charge failed to prepare
for the worst-case scenario

427
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,350
and have been slow
in fixing mistakes.

428
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,110
All of which means, in May,

429
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,670
we are still playing catch-up
in the middle of a pandemic,

430
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,910
which in turn, means thousands
upon thousands of people

431
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,630
dying preventable deaths.

432
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,030
If this is a "great success story"
for anyone,

433
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,230
it's for the fucking coronavirus.

434
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,990
We need to scale up tests
massively and right away.

435
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,750
If we want to return to the world
that we're used to, one with sports,

436
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:42,270
restaurants, hugs, and
turning down party invitations

437
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,710
because it's raining
and not because you might die,

438
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,670
testing is how we get there.

439
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,430
And that is a message

440
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,470
that should really unite
everyone in this country.

441
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,790
From the people at home, worried
about the potential loss of life,

442
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,070
to the people out protesting
social distancing

443
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,190
because they think
it's too high a price to pay,

444
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,270
to Alex Jones preparing
to barbecue his neighbors.

445
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,710
We could all stand to listen
to the advice of one of our bravest,

446
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,230
brightest stars.

447
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,110
Testing !

448
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:17,590
That guy was really ahead
of his time. And now, this.

449
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:24,150
Even During a Pandemic, Florida
Just Can't Help But Be Florida.

450
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:28,670
A judge in Florida published a letter
expressing his frustrations

451
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,990
with recent attorney appearances,
including a shirtless male lawyer

452
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:37,790
and a female showing up to virtual
court from under her covers in bed.

453
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:42,470
Only in Florida, protective
masks made from python skin.

454
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,150
Only in Florida do you see
a manatee and an alligator

455
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,870
swimming together during quarantine.

456
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:50,150
The public service announcement
one Florida county is putting out.

457
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:55,150
The state of Florida declared that
the WWE was an essential business.

458
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:59,150
Only in Florida would a man
pretend to have coronavirus

459
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,270
to try and get out of an arrest.

460
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,630
Why does this
always happen in Florida ?

461
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:08,630
I know, right ? Always Florida.
Florida man...

462
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:13,390
A Florida man showing up to court...
A lawyer ! Put your shirt on !

463
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,190
Come on, Florida. Put your shirt on.

464
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,190
Moving on.
Before we go tonight,

465
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,710
I just wanted to say
a quick word about pets.

466
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,190
As you may remember, a couple
of weeks ago we discussed the fact

467
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,550
that Wendy Williams has cats
that never come when she calls them.

468
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,630
I mentioned that I actually
have 28 cats who ignore me, too.

469
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,950
I'll show you. Gibson !
Smooches ! Henry ! Monk !

470
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,910
Daisy ! Salt ! Pepper !
Salt-n-Pepa !

471
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:41,470
Anastasia ! Butternut !
Gambit ! Bilbo ! JCPenney !

472
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:45,510
David Meowie !
Gazpacho ! Scratchy Boy !

473
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:49,790
Will ! Grace ! Franklin !
Bash ! Rizolli !

474
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,510
Isles ! Halt !
Catch Fire ! Magellan !

475
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:57,430
Tumbles ! Ayatollah Cat-Meini !
Frank !

476
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:02,550
See ? Nothing.
We love animals on this show

477
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,870
and it recently came to our attention
that some of your cats, in particular,

478
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,310
reciprocate our interest.

479
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:10,190
Look at one that was
watching our show a few weeks ago.

480
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,990
Take an intimate boat trip
with their two best friends

481
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,590
to kill their third best friend.

482
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:18,470
I just hope Tony washed his hands
for two "Happy Birthdays".

483
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,710
And if you are worried that
you might be running out of content

484
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:25,350
that can help you mentally escape,
then you're actually in luck.

485
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,870
I'm not sure
what's more remarkable there,

486
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:31,230
that that cat is so fixated on me
or that that cat is watching this show

487
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,710
on an actual television and
not, like everyone else,

488
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,790
on YouTube
in the middle of a work day.

489
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:40,270
That cat is not an outlier,
many of them watch our show.

490
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,110
Here is a cat pawing at my face

491
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,550
like it's trying to get a stubborn
stain off the screen.

492
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,030
Here's a cat chasing my hands

493
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:49,110
like they're a pair of delicious,
highly-caffeinated spiders.

494
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,510
Here's another
doing the exact same thing.

495
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:54,550
Here's another cat starting
at our show on an iPhone

496
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,310
with a level of interest that,
let's be honest,

497
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,430
no human
has ever been able to muster.

498
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,950
And then, there is this.

499
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,870
It was an example of the warning
system working well.

500
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,910
Because while, yes,
AccuWeather did inform their...

501
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,030
I don't know why cats
are so obsessed with me.

502
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,750
I don't know if it's my furtive,
prey-like movements

503
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:15,710
or the fact that my general demeanor
is of a large, easily subdued bird.

504
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,030
Whatever the reason,

505
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,790
cats seem to be picking up
what we're putting down here.

506
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,910
If you're thinking: "Hold on John.
Maybe this isn't just a cat thing !"

507
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,750
"What about
all the dogs out there ?"

508
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,230
We actually looked into videos
of dogs watching this show

509
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:30,070
and it turns out they've got
a slightly different reaction.

510
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:45,110
Who would have thought that
aside from thunder and fireworks,

511
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,830
the things that dogs
hate to hear most

512
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:50,510
are 20-minute-long deep dives
into systemic issues plaguing society ?

513
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,110
And you know what ?
As usual, dogs aren't wrong.

514
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:57,110
Still, that started us wondering
if cats love this show so much,

515
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,550
why not make this more appealing
to them

516
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,750
and fully pander
to their every interest ?

517
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,270
So, without further ado,

518
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,750
please enjoy this brief installment
of our new spin-off show.

519
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,710
Welcome to Cat Week Tonight !

520
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,870
I'm John Oliver,
thank you so much for joining us.

521
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:31,630
It's been a busy week, so we don't
even have time to discuss these hands.

522
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,230
Can you catch 'em ?

523
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,670
They're over here now !
Now, they're over here !

524
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,750
You almost got 'em !

525
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:41,110
But let's get right to our main
story tonight, which is boxes.

526
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,510
What's inside them ? Something ?
That's good.

527
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,630
Nothing ? Even better,
that's more room for you.

528
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:50,390
Still, boxes do have their issues,
as this goldfish will tell you.

529
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,630
I think I speak for everyone
watching this show when I say:

530
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,590
"How the fuck is that goldfish
not in my mouth right now ?"

531
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,710
But the big problem with boxes is,
they're not always available.

532
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,310
But that is where
paper bags come into the picture.

533
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:09,390
Paper bags are obviously great,
you can sit in them for hours.

534
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,990
But are they better than boxes ?

535
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,870
I'd argue no, because a box
is simply more durable.

536
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:17,350
Although, not as durable
as my love for Cat Adam Driver.

537
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,590
Scratch my sofa,
you purring mountain.

538
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:24,350
Eat my toilet paper,
you fuzzy landslide.

539
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,990
Usually we like
to try and end our show

540
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,750
with some sort of produced video
starring a celebrity.

541
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,030
We would love to do that
for you tonight, cats.

542
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,590
But sadly, due to this pandemic,
we can't shoot anything new.

543
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,670
But, we actually realized
that a few years back,

544
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,190
we produced a doomsday video
that required Martin Sheen to deliver

545
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:45,750
a heartfelt reading of the word
"cats" in front of a green screen.

546
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:49,350
And like any good actor, he gave
us a lot of excellent options.

547
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,670
So cats, we've put together
a little salute to you.

548
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,390
Please enjoy.

549
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,910
Cats.

550
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,790
Cats.

551
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,030
Cats.

552
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,990
Cats.

553
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:13,910
Cats.

554
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,150
Cats.

555
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,670
Cats.

556
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,870
Cats.

557
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,510
Cats...

558
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,270
Cats.

559
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,190
That's our show, thanks
so much for watching, cats !

560
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,110
See you next week, goodnight !
Here you go, cats.

561
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,470
Get it, cats ! Have a listen
to this ! Do you like this, cats ?

562
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:05,150
Do you like rabbits ?
Do you like this ?

563
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:08,310
Do you like a little parrot, cats ?
Can you get it ?

564
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:11,590
Can you get it ?
Can you get this little thing ?

565
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,190
Can you get this, cats ?

566
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,630
Cats.

567
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,830
