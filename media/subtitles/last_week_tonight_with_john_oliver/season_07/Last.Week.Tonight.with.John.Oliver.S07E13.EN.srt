00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,450
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,110
Welcome again to the show,
where I'm still stuck in this void.

3
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,510
I don't mean my body. I mention it,
scratch that, make it two white voids.

4
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,710
It's been a truly brutal week,
with protests across the country

5
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,390
in response to the horrific killing
of George Floyd

6
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,550
at the hands
of the Minneapolis Police.

7
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,310
There is a lot to discuss here:

8
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,350
how these protests are a response
to a legacy of police misconduct

9
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,950
both in Minneapolis
and in the nation at large,

10
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,350
and how that misconduct
is built on a legacy

11
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,230
of white supremacy that prioritizes
the comfort of white Americans

12
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,190
over the safety of people of color.

13
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,390
There is so much to say, some of it
complicated, much of it all too clear.

14
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,830
Or you could go on TV, open up
your mouth, and let this shit fall out.

15
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,350
Rioting is the one thing
you don't want.

16
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,790
Ugly opinions, police brutality,
officious bird watchers,

17
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,150
rude entitled ladies
walking their dogs in big city parks.

18
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:25,630
All of that is bad but none of it
is nearly as bad as what you saw.

19
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,950
Okay, first: fuck you, Tucker.
That's just a general point.

20
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,510
Second: saying "officious bird watcher"
is deeply offensive.

21
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,430
You're either trying to both-sides
that Central Park incident,

22
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,430
or insulting fans of this show,

23
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,910
who proudly call themselves
"officious bird watchers".

24
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,310
I am the officious bird.
They are the watchers.

25
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,070
Keep their name
out of your mouth !

26
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,070
But for the larger point here:

27
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,910
people like Tucker love to venerate
order at moments like this.

28
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,950
And that's easy to do when order,
in its current form,

29
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,550
is designed to benefit
and protect you.

30
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,150
But it's hard to overstate how
clearly we've been reminded lately

31
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,550
of the hostility of our existing
order toward black people,

32
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,190
who have been killed
by police on the street,

33
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,510
killed by police in their own home,
killed by wannabe police in the street,

34
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,790
and threatened with state
violence while literally birding.

35
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,950
Collectively, that has got to be some
sort of brutality bingo right there.

36
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,870
And when order results
in you lying face down on a lawn

37
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,270
while your grandma
stands between you and the police

38
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,950
who've pulled their guns on you
after you allegedly rolled a stop sign,

39
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:31,110
being lectured about the importance
of order at the expense of all else,

40
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,350
is just not what you want
to fucking hear right now.

41
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,230
And in the initial aftermath
of the killing of George Floyd,

42
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,430
the president tweeted condolences, but
you knew something worse was coming.

43
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,670
True enough, it soon did.

44
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,990
The president tweeted,
"These THUGS," all caps,

45
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,590
"are dishonoring
the memory of George Floyd,

46
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,310
and I won't let that happen.

47
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,150
Any difficulty and we will
assume control

48
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,590
but, when the looting starts,
the shooting starts."

49
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,990
Set aside that when a man like
Donald Trump uses the word "thugs"

50
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,310
you know exactly what it's code for.

51
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,350
"When the looting starts,
the shooting starts,"

52
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,430
is actually a quote from a notoriously
racist 1960s Miami Police chief.

53
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,030
And it is truly astounding

54
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,950
how Donald Trump
has managed to live nearly 74 years

55
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,950
with a remedial understanding
of spelling, grammar, geography,

56
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,670
science, civics, nutrition,
and child development,

57
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,790
and yet, he's the fucking
Library of Alexandria

58
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,830
when it comes to racist maxims
of the 20th century.

59
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,270
But for our main story tonight,
I'd like to talk

60
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,430
about how the president
spent the first half of his week.

61
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,750
Because in the midst of 40 million
Americans unemployed,

62
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,710
100 000 Americans dead,
and racial tensions boiling over,

63
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,190
he chose to spend his days
focusing on this.

64
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,310
President Trump overnight
taking to Twitter to take on Twitter,

65
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:53,270
along with other social media giants
for what he calls political bias.

66
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,390
It comes after Twitter,
for the first time,

67
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,470
added a fact check footnote
on two of his tweets

68
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,710
that called mail-in ballots
substantially fraudulent.

69
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,750
Twitter fact-checked
the president's tweets.

70
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,750
They're also apparently fact-checking
other tweets, but not all of them.

71
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,390
Because we just tweeted
"Luke is the best Hemsworth."

72
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,390
and so far, that has not been
flagged as a damaging lie.

73
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,590
Come on, Twitter ! Either your system
works or it doesn't !

74
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,630
It is a known
fact that the order goes

75
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:23,470
Chris Hemsworth, Liam Hemsworth,
no Hemsworths, then, Luke.

76
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,150
It is worth taking a look at the
statement that caused Twitter to act.

77
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,110
Trump's claim that voting by mail
in this year's elections

78
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,150
will be "substantially fraudulent."

79
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:38,630
He's tweeted about it a ridiculous
number of times in the last two months,

80
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,630
and he brings it up constantly.

81
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,070
Mail ballots are a very dangerous thing
for this country. They're cheaters.

82
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,150
They go and collect them.
They're fraudulent in many cases.

83
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,350
The mail ballots are corrupt,
in my opinion.

84
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,910
And they collect 'em, and they
get people to go in and sign 'em.

85
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,710
They're forgeries in many cases.
It's a horrible thing.

86
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,110
What he just said
there was complete bullshit

87
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,070
and actively harmful
to the democratic process.

88
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,270
But in a weird way, it's almost
comforting to hear him busting out

89
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,750
his classic 2016 hits about voter fraud
and rigged elections.

90
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,990
It brings you back to a simpler time,
doesn't it ?

91
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,990
When we could go to restaurants freely,
we had no idea what Zoom was,

92
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,830
and we were sure that an obviously
unqualified presidential candidate

93
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,950
was gonna lose in a historic landslide.

94
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:26,790
2016, you truly were the good old,
only-less-horrifying-in-context days.

95
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,670
And the thing is,
voting by mail is a popular idea.

96
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,350
70% of us are in favor of allowing any
voter to vote by mail if they want to.

97
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,990
And if this pandemic continues into
the fall, as it almost certainly will,

98
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,950
many voters
will want to do exactly that.

99
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,750
Because think about it: holding
an in-person election during a pandemic

100
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,870
is an absolute nightmare.

101
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,110
Elections involve
hundreds of people

102
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,670
cycling in and out
of an enclosed location.

103
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,630
Plus, polling places are often
located in communal buildings,

104
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,870
like schools and nursing homes, and
many of those are out of the question.

105
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,590
Even keeping poll workers safe
can be difficult.

106
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,510
According to one estimate,
while the typical voter

107
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,830
may encounter only about 20 other
people when they go to the polls,

108
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,990
the typical poll worker
will encounter about 700.

109
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,830
And many are understandably
concerned about that.

110
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:18,710
I never thought I'd say this in my time
but this scares me, this kind of thing.

111
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,790
For McGhee and a majority of poll
workers, they're in their 60s or 70s.

112
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,870
Health experts say this age group
is among some of the most vulnerable.

113
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,750
Even if we have a line of 10 people,

114
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,790
how are we gonna keep everybody
safe from the germs ?

115
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,390
We have a touch screen. We'll have
to wipe that down every time.

116
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,150
Are we supposed to have people
bring their own pencil ?

117
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,830
No, of course not !

118
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,910
And not just because
they shouldn't have to,

119
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,230
but also, who the hell
owns a fully functioning pencil ?

120
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,030
You might have one with a usable
eraser, but an unusable tip.

121
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,590
Or, maybe you have one with
a sharpened tip, but the eraser's gone.

122
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,390
Or maybe you've got
one with a functioning tip,

123
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,110
but the eraser's all hard
and leaves a brown streak on the paper.

124
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,310
And yeah, you could sharpen
any of these pencils, but with what ?

125
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,590
A pencil sharpener ?
You don't own one of those !

126
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:09,190
Unless you do, in which case,
just answer me this: where is it ?

127
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,910
If you think you're prepared to bring
a working pencil to a polling station,

128
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,670
then you are living
in a fucking fantasy world !

129
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,390
That woman decided
not to work her state's primary

130
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,670
out of fear for her safety,
and many voters share her concerns.

131
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,990
Not all state officials are addressing
those concerns especially well.

132
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,070
Just listen to Missouri's governor
Mike Parson

133
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,990
offer advice ahead
of next week's local elections there.

134
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,550
I hope people feel safe
but to go out and vote,

135
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,670
but if they don't,
the number one thing is their safety

136
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,990
should be number one.

137
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,950
So, if they don't,
then don't go out and vote.

138
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,910
I don't know
I've ever heard myself say that,

139
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,870
but if you didn't feel safe,
then I wouldn't do that.

140
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,950
Hold on there !
Voting is a right !

141
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,910
It has to be easy to understand
and accessible to everyone,

142
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,150
unlike, say, HBO Max.

143
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,950
What the fuck is that, by the way ?
Does anyone actually know ?

144
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,870
How do I get it ?
I'm on it and I don't know.

145
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,630
And why is it so purple ?

146
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,310
It's like I'm watching television
from inside Grimace's asshole.

147
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,710
And not in a good way.

148
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,710
There are a lot of ways
to mitigate the dangers here,

149
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,270
but perhaps the biggest is expanding
the option to vote by mail.

150
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,950
The thing that Trump lies about often,
Twitter finally decided to step in.

151
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,510
So let's take a look at why the option
of voting by mail is so necessary,

152
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,950
why concerns
about it are often overblown,

153
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,270
and why talking about it right now
is actually really important.

154
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,550
And let's start with the fact that we
actually have a pretty good lesson

155
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,630
for just how badly an election
during a pandemic can be bungled,

156
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,470
thanks to Wisconsin.

157
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,230
They held their primary last month,

158
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,550
and it was absolute chaos partly
because their Democratic governor

159
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,750
had tried to delay it,
only to be thwarted

160
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,030
by the Republican-controlled
state legislature and Supreme Court.

161
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,790
And the Republican assembly speaker,
Robin Vos, tried to reassure people

162
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,830
that everything was safe
while volunteering at a polling place.

163
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,510
But something about how he delivered
that message was a little unconvincing.

164
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,150
You think voting in person
is putting people at risk today ?

165
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:12,990
I don't. I say to myself that we have
every single opportunity to be safe.

166
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,110
Do you, Robin ?

167
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,190
Because you're sending
two very different messages there.

168
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,590
Your mouth is saying, "Don't worry,
everything's safe and cool,"

169
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:25,910
but it's being slightly undercut by the fact
your dress code is Chernobyl casual.

170
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,270
And unsurprisingly,
many didn't buy his assurances.

171
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,830
Due to safety concerns,

172
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,030
there was a massive reduction
of polling sites in some big cities,

173
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,830
with Milwaukee's 180 polling sites
being reduced down to just five,

174
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,510
resulting in massive lines.

175
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,390
Adding to chaos was the fact a record
number of mail ballots were requested,

176
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,110
hundreds of which
never arrived or arrived late.

177
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,910
All of which resulted in sights like
this immunocompromised woman

178
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,710
casting her ballot
while wearing a garbage bag.

179
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,310
No one should have to wear a garbage
bag because they're trying to vote.

180
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,430
You should only have to wear one

181
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,750
because you're trying to shed excess
water weight so you look extra-jacked.

182
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,390
I haven't stopped my pump routine
just because of the lockdown.

183
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,670
I still catch the diesel
express every day,

184
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,590
the sun don't shine before this
swole-ar eclipse runs its course.

185
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,190
You might as well put me in a tortilla
with some salsa and lime,

186
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,990
because my beef is shredded.

187
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,470
Having been put into this position,

188
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:25,390
you can kind of understand why the
voters in Wisconsin were so pissed.

189
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,870
This is so wrong. This election
should have been called off.

190
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:35,030
They're telling us to stay in the house
and stand six feet from each other.

191
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:41,270
But one of the most important times,
they're forcing us to come in a group,

192
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,550
stop playing politics with our lives.

193
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,830
That must've been frustrating.

194
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:51,430
You can't pretend the virus has stopped
for a day in order to hold an election.

195
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,190
It doesn't give a fuck
about democracy.

196
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,630
It's just one of the many ways

197
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,670
that Covid-19 is the Donald Trump
of infectious diseases.

198
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,230
It's also weirdly shaped

199
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,470
and disproportionately harmful
to minorities.

200
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,670
And remember:
that was just a primary.

201
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,910
November's general election
will have a much higher turnout.

202
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,990
How do we prevent
what happened in Wisconsin

203
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,750
from happening 50 times over ?

204
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,630
One obvious answer
is to make it easier to vote by mail.

205
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,110
But some argue that that's
a dangerously radical proposition.

206
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:24,350
Everyone's afraid.
Everyone's rethinking how we do things.

207
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,790
Should we do it a new way ?
We should be open-minded.

208
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,710
Why haven't we had mail-in ballots
for the last 230 years ?

209
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,510
Maybe the reason
is mail-in ballots

210
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,870
are an invitation
to widespread fraud and manipulation.

211
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:43,190
If you want to rattle people's faith in
the system that we've had for centuries

212
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,390
maybe you would do that,
I don't know.

213
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:50,190
You don't know ? First off, Tucker,
thanks so much for admitting that.

214
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,990
One of the biggest problems
with modern discourse

215
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,710
is that people think
admitting a lack of knowledge

216
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,910
is a sign of weakness,
when it's not ! Is it ?

217
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,710
It's how we learn
and grow as individuals.

218
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,950
So, it's really heartening
to see someone in your position

219
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,630
admit that they don't have
all the facts.

220
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:06,030
Facts like, for instance, that we've
had voting by mail since the Civil War

221
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,510
and that one in four Americans

222
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,070
cast a mail ballot
in the last two federal elections.

223
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,870
Your premise that voting by mail is a
new idea that would shatter democracy

224
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,350
is, in fact, completely wrong
and deeply stupid.

225
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,430
That's not a reflection on you,
though-is it ?

226
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,350
You engaged in a dialogue
in good faith, so thank you.

227
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,910
Unless you weren't doing that,
in which case:

228
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,270
go fuck yourself,
you human boat shoe.

229
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:31,230
So the question isn't, "Should
we have voting by mail at all ?"

230
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,710
because we already do.

231
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,870
It's "How hard
should we make it ?"

232
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,790
Depending on where you live,
the answer can vary widely.

233
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,670
If you live in these five states,
congratulations !

234
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,230
You already have universal,
all-mail voting,

235
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,230
where a ballot is automatically sent
to every eligible voter.

236
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,430
If you live in these 29 states,

237
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,550
you can request
an absentee ballot for any reason.

238
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,710
If you live in these 16 states,

239
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,430
you do have to provide
a reason to vote absentee,

240
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,590
and while these 11 have,
at least in some cases,

241
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,550
allowed the "fear of coronavirus"
to be a valid one,

242
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,110
these five states have not.

243
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,070
Also, almost no states
have decided whether or not

244
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:13,150
it'll be a valid excuse
for the general election this November.

245
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,830
And that's not even getting
into some of the other restrictions,

246
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,230
the most ridiculous
of which is Alabama,

247
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,670
where to vote absentee,

248
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,350
you have to submit
a photocopy of your photo ID,

249
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,510
in addition to signing it
before a notary or two witnesses.

250
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,510
And the argument for putting limits
on voting by mail

251
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,790
is that if you don't do that,
people will just cheat.

252
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,430
Think about the voter
re-the registration records

253
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,990
in states
that have not been purged.

254
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,790
By that, I mean, dead people
have not been removed.

255
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,590
You can request
an absentee ballot in that name,

256
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,190
have it mailed to a different
address saying you moved,

257
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,230
but you know the person's dead,

258
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,230
and then say you're back
at the old address and go and vote.

259
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,910
Okay. Now, while that might
sound plausible to you at first,

260
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,870
think how many steps you'd have to take
to successfully make that happen.

261
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,270
You have to know a dead person,
that's hard to do, they're antisocial.

262
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,670
You have to know they were registered
to vote when they were alive.

263
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,470
You have to fill out a form
to request an absentee ballot

264
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,350
be mailed to your address
instead of theirs.

265
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,550
To do that, you'd likely have to re-do
their entire voter registration.

266
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,430
Which would require you
to know personal information:

267
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,990
address, date of birth, the last
four digits of their Social Security,

268
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,950
and their driver's license number
and date when it was issued.

269
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,350
But let's say that you do all of this
and you get their ballot in the mail.

270
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,870
You have to know what
the dead person's signature looks like

271
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,110
to convincingly forge it
because it could be compared

272
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,910
to their signature
already on file.

273
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,030
You had better hope
that notification of their death

274
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,910
never reaches the elections office
through any of the routes it could,

275
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,670
as, despite what Judge Jeanine
would have you believe,

276
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,030
voter rolls go through periodic
list maintenance,

277
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,550
including cross checking
Social Security death records.

278
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,790
And having done all of this,

279
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,350
and, remember,
told authorities where you live,

280
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,110
if you're caught,
you're risking several felonies,

281
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,830
which in many states
involve prison time,

282
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:04,990
all to gain the grand total
of one vote.

283
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,550
It is a crime that's difficult,
high-risk and low reward.

284
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,350
It's as if at the end of "Ocean's 8",
we learned that Sandra Bullock

285
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:15,590
had gone to all the trouble
to steal a map of state quarters.

286
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:20,910
Sandra, why ?
That's $12.50 worth of quarters.

287
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,830
That's a complete waste of your time,
Cate Blanchett's time,

288
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,110
and, most importantly,
Rihanna's time.

289
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:31,670
Fraud can happen in mail-in voting.
Opponents love to cite

290
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,070
a 2005 bipartisan report
that said absentee ballots

291
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,350
remain the largest source
of potential voter fraud.

292
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,910
But what they don't mention is,
that in practice,

293
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,030
it's still incredibly rare.

294
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:48,030
In Oregon in 2016, out of the more
than two million votes cast by mail,

295
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,550
there were just 54 cases
of suspected voter fraud.

296
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,910
That is 0.002 percent.

297
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,430
And to hear Oregon's
former secretary of state tell it,

298
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,910
there's a pretty good
explanation for that.

299
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:05,670
The vast majority of Oregonians
don't care about politics

300
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:09,190
to the level that they're willing
to risk prison time for it.

301
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,270
Yeah, of course they don't !

302
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,390
The only vote Oregonians would risk
prison over

303
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,150
would be a vote to get
Portland Trail Blazer Damian Lillard

304
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,750
into the MVP conversation.

305
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,630
They'd be right to do that.
Dame D.O.L.L.A for life.

306
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,830
I am not saying
that voting by mail is perfect.

307
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,950
Mailed ballots are rejected at a higher
rate than those cast in person.

308
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,630
And it doesn't work
for all communities.

309
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,150
Some people with disabilities
need to go to an in-person voting place

310
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,630
for help casting a ballot and places
like Native American reservations

311
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,070
and remote Alaskan villages may
have unreliable postal service.

312
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,910
Plus, if you vote by mail,
you probably don't get

313
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,990
one of those "I Voted" stickers,
which, if you live in Louisiana,

314
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,750
means you might not have got
this actual sticker,

315
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,350
featuring a truly excellent pelican.

316
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,070
Look at this absolute king.

317
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,790
It's hard to pick my favorite part
of this: his steely blue gaze,

318
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:02,990
his crown that says: "The state of
Louisiana has a monarch, and I am it"

319
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,950
or his prominently-displayed
earring

320
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,390
despite not having
any ears to speak of.

321
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,790
No question here,
that large water bird fucks.

322
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,070
What an incredible motivator
to get out and vote in Louisiana,

323
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,310
that will backfire when
everyone writes in that pelican

324
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,030
as their choice for governor.

325
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:23,870
But, advocates argue that vote
by mail is still a good idea

326
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,710
that would reduce obstacles
to civic participation.

327
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,030
But that, in and of itself,

328
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,430
may be why it's become
so controversial.

329
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,670
Conservative opponents
often speculate

330
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,710
that any increased participation
would benefit Democrats,

331
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,750
despite the fact researchers
have consistently found

332
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,790
that it hasn't obviously helped
one party or the other.

333
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:46,030
And yet, some are willing to go
to extremes to fight this.

334
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:50,590
Texas's AG threatened to prosecute
anyone who encouraged people

335
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,190
to get an absentee ballot because
they were afraid of the coronavirus.

336
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,710
And the lieutenant governor there

337
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:59,310
has been doing some truly
Trump-caliber level fear mongering.

338
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:02,230
When you have an opportunity
to steal a vote,

339
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,270
the Democrats will take advantage of it
and this is what it's all about.

340
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,310
There is no reason,
capital "N", capital "O",

341
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,750
that anyone
under 65 should be able to say:

342
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,230
"I'm afraid to go vote."
Have they been to a grocery store ?

343
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,510
To Walmart ? To Lowe's ?
To Home Depot ?

344
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,910
Have they
been afraid to go out of their house ?

345
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,670
This is a scam by the Democrats
to steal the election.

346
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,990
Far be it for me to challenge
the wisdom of a well-read guy

347
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,030
whose bookshelf is only
half-occupied by footballs,

348
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,910
but going to the grocery store
doesn't mean people aren't afraid,

349
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,710
it means they need to eat.

350
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,790
At a certain point,
hunger outweighs fear.

351
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:40,070
Which is also, incidentally,
the official slogan of Taco Bell.

352
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,910
But,
even in states that try to fight it,

353
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,350
the odds are that there will be more
people voting by mail come this fall.

354
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:51,070
Which brings us to our final point:
how will states handle that ?

355
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,630
First, they need money, fast.

356
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,950
Some estimate the costs of properly
running the 2020 elections,

357
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,790
during the pandemic,
could reach $4 billion.

358
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,910
Unfortunately, the CARES Act
directed just $400 million to states,

359
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,990
which is just
nowhere near enough.

360
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,270
And this funding
needs to come quickly.

361
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,510
Some jurisdictions
are going to struggle

362
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,670
to handle a high volume
of mail ballots.

363
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,830
Take the swing state
of Pennsylvania,

364
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:19,070
which only had 107 000 absentee
ballots in their 2016 primary,

365
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:23,230
but received applications
for over 1.8 million this year.

366
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,590
And coping with surges
like that won't be easy,

367
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,790
it could require hiring and training
dozens of workers to process ballots

368
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,510
or purchasing machinery costing up
to a million dollars per unit.

369
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,750
If you are going to do that,
you need to decide right now,

370
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,390
because machines like high-speed
scanners and sorters

371
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,110
can take several months
to order and safely install.

372
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,630
All of which makes it more
than a little concerning that some,

373
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:51,470
like Missouri Governor Mike Parson,
the man you saw earlier,

374
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,830
telling voters to stay at home
if they didn't feel safe,

375
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,950
some of them have argued
that everyone should relax,

376
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,550
because there's just no rush
to deal with this.

377
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:04,950
Right now, it's about repair
or being prepared for Covid-19,

378
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,470
doing what we can for that.

379
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,110
It's about getting the economy started,
people going back to work.

380
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:14,030
There'll be time to talk about
the elections in November and August

381
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,190
but now's not the time for that,
there'll be time for that.

382
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,470
But now is absolutely
the time to talk about this.

383
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,670
You can not prepare for an election

384
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,310
the same way you update
your computer's software:

385
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,790
by just putting it off for months
on end and secretly hoping

386
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,590
that maybe you'll be dead before
you have to deal with it.

387
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,030
We need to get this right, now !

388
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,870
And it doesn't stop there. Officials
should also be communicating to voters

389
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,190
how to get a mail-in ballot,
when they need to do it by

390
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,110
and how to properly fill it out.

391
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,110
There's actually one last thing

392
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,470
that we may need to personally
prepare ourselves for,

393
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,230
and that is that in November,
if there is, as seems likely,

394
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,190
a surge in mail-in voting,

395
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,990
it may take much longer
for all the ballots to be counted.

396
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,590
We may not know who's won until
a few days after Election Day

397
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,830
and if it doesn't look good
for Donald Trump,

398
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:05,470
look for him to use that to sow
discord among his supporters.

399
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,070
I'm just kidding, of course,
he'll win in a landslide.

400
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:11,630
His speech will be taking a shit
on the stage to thunderous applause.

401
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,110
That's really in keeping
with the vibe 2020 has set so far.

402
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,230
But regardless, there are a few things
that you can do here.

403
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,710
If your state
does allow voting by mail,

404
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,990
you can request and return
your absentee ballot early.

405
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:28,470
This will help flatten the curve
of vote-tabulating on Election Day.

406
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,230
And as a reminder,
if you need a stamp,

407
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,310
these little beauties are available
for two more weeks.

408
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,110
There's one last problem that
we may be able to help you with here

409
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,670
because if the thing that's stopping
you from voting by mail

410
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,270
is not being able
to get a fun free sticker,

411
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,950
we have you covered there.

412
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,750
We've designed four of them
that you can print out at home,

413
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,990
including one that says:

414
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,470
"I Wanted People To Know I Voted
By Mail So I Printed Out This Sticker",

415
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:55,390
one that says: "I Voted By Male" with
an image of this hamster in a Speedo,

416
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,110
one featuring a ghost with an X
through it and the caption:

417
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,150
"I'm Not Dead And I Voted By Mail !"

418
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,630
Finally, in the spirit of Louisiana,
one featuring this emu

419
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,510
wearing a top hat with a nose ring
for no reason whatsoever.

420
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:10,630
All of these are available for you
at IVotedByMail-dot-com.

421
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,350
I would seriously consider doing it.
Because if you vote by mail,

422
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:17,270
not only will you be exercising
your civic duty,

423
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,510
you'll also be making
Tucker Carlson really fucking mad.

424
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:26,310
What better incentive is there
to do absolutely anything than that ?

425
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,110
And now this.

426
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:33,750
TV Hosts Want To Know:
What's That Behind You ?

427
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,830
What is that behind you, Kenny ?

428
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,550
This is my collage wall that I started
'cause I was a little bored.

429
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,350
Wait ! Is there a cat peeking out
behind you ?

430
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,110
I'm a crazy cat lady, thank you
for announcing that on TV, Mark.

431
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,550
What is that behind you ?

432
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:53,150
My son Alden set that up and I didn't
have it in me right now to move it.

433
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:56,190
What is that behind you ?
I'm trying to figure out what that is.

434
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,710
I got quotations for,
in the plumbing industry

435
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:02,270
for condos
and commercial buildings.

436
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,590
Interesting.
Okay, we got to the bottom of that.

437
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,030
What is that behind you,
the steering wheel ?

438
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,470
Is that a clock or what ?
I'm trying to figure out what that is.

439
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:14,190
It's a clock, it's a steering wheel,
you know I love cars. Right ?

440
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,590
When I saw it, I said:
"That thing is mine."

441
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,710
So, I had to get it. Pier 1 Imports,
it was half price on New Year's Day.

442
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:22,070
Be careful, don't want
your kids or Ginger to fall.

443
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,550
They've got two Hot Wheels
on that platform behind you.

444
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,470
What do we call what's
behind you right now ?

445
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,790
Who is that behind you ?

446
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,750
We interrupt a pool game
behind you there ?

447
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,590
Did you get a flower delivery ?
There's a lot of flowers behind you.

448
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:37,190
I kind of like the idea of seeing
where people live.

449
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:42,310
I don't. People are all in your:
"What's that behind you ?"

450
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:47,470
I didn't ask you to come into my home.
This is an extenuating circumstance.

451
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,350
I'm trying to just do my job.

452
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,230
ONE MONTH EARLIER...

453
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,870
Do you have any pictures of me
in your bookcase there ?

454
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,270
You've been looking at my bookcase ?

455
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,350
Who's in the forest shot there ?

456
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,710
Moving on. Finally tonight,
a quick word about the UFC,

457
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,910
the best place to watch grown adults
fight each other in an enclosed space

458
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,470
other than at Thanksgiving.

459
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,870
On our last episode, we covered
how the world of sports is reacting

460
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:18,350
to the coronavirus and we mentioned
that the UFC's president, Dana White,

461
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,630
planned to stage fights on a private
island to skirt travel restrictions.

462
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,590
It wasn't just that idea
that we found ridiculous,

463
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,350
it was the name they chose for it.

464
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,870
The UFC is apparently building
a facility on a private island

465
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,070
that they're calling "Fight Island".

466
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:36,230
Now, is that a clever name ? No.
Is it the perfect name ? Yes.

467
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,870
It's the first thought
an idiot would have

468
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,630
if they wanted to name a private
island where fights happen.

469
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,190
He didn't even go with the obvious name
for an island where you stage fights,

470
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,990
which is simply, UF-SEA.

471
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:52,510
Look at me, Dana. Why didn't you
just call it UF-SEA ? It's perfect.

472
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,070
Yeah,
and I absolutely stand by that.

473
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,950
It looks like I'm not the only one

474
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,270
who thinks that it's a better name
than Fight Island.

475
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,350
Just two days
after our show aired,

476
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:05,350
UFC filed trademark applications
for the term "UF-SEA."

477
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:08,630
Dana White even confirmed
that it wasn't a coincidence.

478
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:13,230
What's his name ?
The guy that came out and said...

479
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:17,550
Yeah. John Oliver
came out and did that piece,

480
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:23,030
with some selective facts
about what we had done in Florida

481
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,830
and all that stuff and UFC.

482
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:29,030
I told my lawyers after that: "See if
the trademarks are there for UFSEA."

483
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,030
Obviously did and obviously
you guys know about it.

484
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,150
Did we get 'em ?

485
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,950
Yeah, I think we got it.
Thanks, John Oliver.

486
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:41,550
Dana White intentionally forgetting
my name is a truly excellent neg.

487
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:44,230
Or, rather, it would be,
if he weren't only number 83

488
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:48,590
on GQ's list of the 100 most powerful
bald men in the world from 2013.

489
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:52,550
Now that is a neg, right there !
You got beat by Jason Alexander.

490
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,310
You got Costanza-ed.

491
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,830
Look, much more importantly:
I'm not remotely mad here.

492
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,670
I want you to use that name.

493
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,390
I think you should let us rename
all of your events,

494
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,790
because frankly,
you're not very good at it.

495
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:08,430
Take UFC 249.
It's just your logo plus a number.

496
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:12,310
Where's the pizzazz there ?
How about this: "UFC: Knuckle Opera ?"

497
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:16,350
Or: "Dust-Up At The Beef Factory ?"
Or: "Large Hamboy Collider ?"

498
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,910
Better, right ? Who doesn't want
to see some hamboys collide now ?

499
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,510
Even the name "Dana White"
could use a little punch-up.

500
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,310
Doesn't sound like the head
of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.

501
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:29,590
It sounds like the third-best
real estate agent in Sacramento

502
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,230
or a video where a white woman

503
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,910
calls the cops on a black family
for smiling too hard.

504
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:37,190
Here are some name
improvements for you, free of charge:

505
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:43,390
Dumps McFightman, Lug Steakface,
Spamiel Musclemilk, Skull Brisket,

506
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,550
Tummybuns Bin Laden,
Rufus T. Namethief,

507
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,470
or my personal favorite: Doug.

508
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,110
Just Doug. No last name
like Cher and Madonna.

509
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:56,310
That's the Dougest Doug I've ever
seen, maximum Dougness right there.

510
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:01,830
I am not mad at Tug Slabmeat
for stealing our idea for "UFSEA".

511
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,430
We may not even be the first person
he's stolen from.

512
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:08,190
He only filed for the "Fight Island"
trademark a week after

513
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:11,950
a TMZ reporter suggested to him
that he call it that.

514
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,350
The only thing that he's done
here that annoyed me

515
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,870
was accusing us
of using "selective facts".

516
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,750
Because facts are to me what other
people's ideas are to Dana White,

517
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,910
something I'm very passionate about.

518
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,590
What apparently upset him
was that in our piece,

519
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:29,190
we pointed out that three people,
a UFC fighter and his two cornermen,

520
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,470
all tested positive for coronavirus
before a recent event,

521
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:36,030
underscoring the fact that it seems
impossible to return to sports

522
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,110
completely without risk right now.

523
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:41,950
White responded on Twitter, saying:
"We had 3 events, NOT 1",

524
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,950
which is completely irrelevant,
and that those three positives

525
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,830
came from 11-hundred tests,

526
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:51,990
which does seem to minimize it
until you learn that all those tests

527
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,190
were administered to just 300 people.

528
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,510
Basically,
Dana was quoting a larger number

529
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:59,310
to make the positive result
look less significant,

530
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:02,590
which seems like,
I dunno, a selective fact.

531
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:06,350
I think Dana White's just
looking for a fight here.

532
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:10,550
I'm almost certain that he is, because
he's literally trademarked the phrase:

533
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,830
"Dana White Lookin' for a Fight."

534
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:16,750
That's real and, as we learned when
looking up his filing for "UFSEA",

535
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,910
it's just one of the many phrases
he's trademarked in the past.

536
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,630
There's "Fight Library",
which is excellent,

537
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,190
"Chicken Monster",
which is somehow even better

538
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,030
and "Baddest Motherfucker",

539
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,190
which I always assumed
was owned by Samuel L. Jackson.

540
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:35,110
Although, UFC's filing for that
cites only a handful of potential uses,

541
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,590
among them "toy figures"
and "action figures".

542
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:41,270
It's the perfect phrase
to have on a child's toy.

543
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,870
That does make you wonder

544
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,910
whether it's legal to put that phrase
onto other objects.

545
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,870
Would Dana White sue you

546
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,350
if you put it on something
not covered by his trademark ?

547
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:53,830
A mug, for instance ?
I guess we'll never know, will we ?

548
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:57,950
Cheers, Dana ! Cheers to you.

549
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,110
When we started looking deeper,

550
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,750
we also realized that there's
a number of trademarks

551
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:06,790
that they've applied for and got
and then let expire.

552
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,550
My favorite of which
is "You Will Submit",

553
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:12,110
which they trademarked
for use on baby booties,

554
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,990
fanny packs and walking canes.

555
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:17,070
Because nothing says I'm gonna
beat you into submission

556
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,870
like a baby with a cane
wearing a fanny pack.

557
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,670
Since Dana took something
that we came up with,

558
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,230
we're going to return the favor.

559
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,470
Guess who is now officially
in the process of owning

560
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,470
the trademark
"You Will Submit" ?

561
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,870
I'll give you a clue:
it's got two thumbs,

562
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:36,790
it's sheltering in a white void and
it's about to sell this baby onesie,

563
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:40,670
which you can find at
"TugSlabmeatsBabyPalace-dot-com."

564
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,510
Who's the baddest
motherfucker now, Dana ?

565
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,670
That's our show, thank you
so much for watching.

566
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:50,590
We'll see you next week,
good night ! Buy a onesie. Do it !

567
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,990
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
