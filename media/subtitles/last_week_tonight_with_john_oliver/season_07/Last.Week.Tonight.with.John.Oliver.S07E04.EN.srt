00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,000
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,080
SEASON VII
EPISODE 4

3
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,360
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,880
I am John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,920
We have just time
for a quick recap of the week,

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,960
which saw Elizabeth Warren
and Michael Bloomberg

7
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,560
ending
their presidential campaigns.

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,600
In Bloomberg's case, after spending
over half a billion dollars.

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,640
It is hard to overstate just how
much money Bloomberg wasted,

10
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,080
although, as Brian Williams' viewers
know, it's not impossible.

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,960
When I read it tonight
on social media,

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,760
it kind of all became clear.

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,480
Bloomberg spent 500 million on ads.
U.S. population, 327 million.

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,120
Don't tell us if you're ahead of us
on the math.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,880
He could have given
each American $1 million

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,040
and have had
lunch money left over.

17
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,880
It's an incredible way
of putting it.

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,800
It's an incredible way of putting it.
It's true. It's disturbing.

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,360
Okay, for the record:
it's not true.

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,080
$500 million divided by
327 million is not a million.

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,760
It's around a dollar fifty.
Which goes to show, two:

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,400
you can't believe
everything you see on Twitter !

23
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,640
Twitter is not
where you go for facts.

24
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,600
It's where you see the official account
for New Jersey tweet: "gabagool",

25
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,600
or Post Malone tweet:
"is meatball an fruit"

26
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,480
or see Henry Winkler posting
photos of him holding fish.

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,240
Seriously:
it's all the man does.

28
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,160
But obviously, the big story
of this week was the coronavirus,

29
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,080
how the common cold
describes itself on its resume.

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,760
Cases continue to rise,
and unfortunately,

31
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,160
the Trump administration's response
has left a lot to be desired.

32
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,720
The president has been
playing fast and loose with the facts,

33
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,760
claiming a coronavirus vaccine
could be ready in months.

34
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't think they know
what the time will be.

35
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,000
I've heard very quick numbers,
a matter of months

36
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,400
and I've heard pretty much a year
would be an outside number.

37
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,720
Only to be contradicted
by the experts.

38
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,520
So he's asking the question:
"When is it gonna be deployable ?"

39
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,840
and that is gonna be,
at the earliest,

40
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,800
a year to a year and a half,
no matter how fast you go.

41
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,600
Every Trump press conference
has to come with an epilogue

42
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,960
from an expert clarifying
all the things he just got wrong.

43
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,160
"The president said a cure would come
quickly, more likely to take a year."

44
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,080
He also said that it's
"the meanest virus he's ever seen".

45
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,800
That's ridiculous, it's a virus,
it has no intent.

46
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,520
You also saw the president
assure us

47
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,880
that you couldn't get the virus
from sucking on deez.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,800
I then mistakenly asked:
'Deez what ?' to which he replied:

49
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,920
'Deez nuts' and
demanded a high five.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,880
"And while I cannot believe
I have to say this,"

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,200
"depending on the nuts,
we cannot say for absolute certain"

52
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:08,480
"you would not get the coronavirus
from sucking on doze nuts."

53
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,680
It is not just that
the Trump administration

54
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,080
is sometimes
doling out bad information,

55
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,200
it's occasionally
no information at all.

56
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,040
On Wednesday,
the vice president gave a briefing

57
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,880
in which he claimed insurance would
cover the coronavirus testing,

58
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,240
but watch as he leaves

59
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,520
before a reporter can ask
a fairly important follow up.

60
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,120
Thank you.

61
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,040
Can the uninsured get tested ?

62
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,280
Gentlemen, ladies,
can the uninsured get tested ?

63
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,560
Screaming for the camera
isn't gonna get you anywhere.

64
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,360
How about answering the question ?
That's a valid question !

65
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,880
Yeah, it is a valid question !

66
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,000
He's asking if nearly 30 million
uninsured Americans will have access

67
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,480
to a test for a deadly,
contagious virus !

68
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,000
That is relevant ! If he was
shouting something pointless out like:

69
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,960
"What's thedifference
between bisque and chowder ?"

70
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,480
Or:
"Are chipmunks just baby squirrels ?"

71
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,400
Or: "Should Nelly be considered
an elite rapper ?"

72
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,920
Ignore him.
Those questions are stupid.

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,880
For the record,
the answers are:

74
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,400
texture, no, and of course
Nelly's an elite rapper !

75
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,280
"Country Grammar", "E.I.",
"Ride Wit Me", "Batter Up",

76
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,040
on a debut album ?

77
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,040
Get the fuck out of here with
this non-elite rapper bullshit !

78
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,160
The event that summed up how chaotic
the president's response has been

79
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,960
was when he visited the CDC
on Friday, and spent 45 minutes,

80
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,520
among other things, saying
the governor of Washington

81
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,160
"is a snake", asking if his town hall
on Fox News got good ratings

82
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,240
and bragging that every one
of the doctors at the CDC said:

83
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,200
"How do you know
so much about this ?"

84
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,440
to which his answer was:
"Maybe I have a natural ability."

85
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,280
Then, there was the subject
of testing kits,

86
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,800
the current shortage of which may be
allowing virus to spread undetected.

87
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,160
Even Mike Pence has said
it could be a matter of weeks

88
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,440
until the tests
are widely available.

89
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,440
So, right now, not everyone who wants
a test can get a test.

90
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,000
That's important to know, yet
for some reason, Trump said this.

91
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,000
Anybody that wants a test
can get a test.

92
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,840
Anybody right now
and yesterday,

93
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,600
anybody that needs a test,
gets a test.

94
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,760
They have the tests.
And the tests are beautiful.

95
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,360
Set aside how weird it is

96
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,080
to call a test
for a deadly disease "beautiful".

97
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,040
The fact is, what he just
said is flagrantly untrue.

98
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,720
There are currently
not enough available tests.

99
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,760
And you can't just
state something as a fact

100
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,240
because you wish it was true,

101
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,240
anymore that I can just declare myself
America's most fuckable John.

102
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,760
I'm not. I'm just not.
I'm the second most fuckable John,

103
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,520
and until he dies,
I have to be fine with that.

104
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,240
It's an uncomfortable fact.
Perhaps even more worrying,

105
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,320
was how clear it became
that to Trump,

106
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,800
managing perceptions
here is a huge priority.

107
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,560
He kept bragging that the U.S.
has seen only 240 confirmed cases

108
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,880
and 11 deaths, far lower
than some affected countries.

109
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,600
Those numbers kept coming up.
He even cited them when explaining

110
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,080
why he was loathe to evacuate the ship
that's docked off San Francisco,

111
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,040
where 21 people aboard
have tested positive for the virus.

112
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,280
I would rather, because I like
the numbers being where they are.

113
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,320
I don't need to have the numbers
double because of one ship.

114
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,240
I would rather have the numbers
stay where they are.

115
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,200
But if they want to take them off,
they'll take them off.

116
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,960
But if that happens, your 240
is gonna be a much higher number

117
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,880
and probably the 11
will be a higher number, too.

118
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,560
Yeah, it will !

119
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,200
But you get that those numbers
are also people, right ?

120
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,680
And that things that happen
on boats still count, right ?

121
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,080
Otherwise that would mean

122
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,880
that Henry Winkler
has never caught a single fish.

123
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,960
And he has. Look at him,
the man's out for trout !

124
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,320
If Trump had gotten his way and we had
left people on board indefinitely,

125
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,480
the infection
would've likely spread more.

126
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,640
I'd say it's impossible to have such
a callous indifference to human life,

127
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,720
but he does seem to have
a natural ability for it.

128
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,600
Let's move on
to a quick update on India.

129
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,160
Or as people with this accent have
historically called it: "Mine".

130
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,280
A couple of weeks ago,
we did a story

131
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,040
about India's prime minister,
Narendra Modi,

132
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,280
which some diehard Modi supporters
like Arnab Goswami,

133
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,880
the Tucker Carlson of India,
did not enjoy.

134
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,600
The first hint I got that he was
not happy with me

135
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
was in a promo
for his upcoming show.

136
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,080
Go look at yourself in the mirror
and tell yourself

137
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,960
whether you're a motivated fool,
consciously or unconsciously a fool,

138
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,560
or whether
you are just malicious.

139
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,200
I don't know if you noticed
there, but when he said:

140
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,120
"Look in the mirror",
this is what was in the mirror.

141
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,800
That might not be me.
That could be Steve Mnuchin

142
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,880
or Milhouse from "The Simpsons",
or this one owl.

143
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,360
Ya know, any number of hotties.
But in case you were thinking

144
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,320
that it could've been someone else,
his show cleared any confusion up.

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,440
An ignoramus of exceedingly
global proportions...

146
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:14,160
A man whose only job
is as a comedian,

147
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,600
he's not even smart
enough to be a satirist.

148
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,160
A person with absolutely
no knowledge and who, I'm told,

149
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,000
even has his "good morning"
and "good evening" written out to him

150
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,680
by his team of researchers.

151
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,560
A British-American
late-night third-rate TV host.

152
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,240
John Oliver,
you embarrassed yourself.

153
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,960
Listen, I'll give you "ignoramus".

154
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,160
I'll even give you
"third-rate TV host".

155
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,840
My researchers assure me
that's actually a compliment.

156
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,000
But I "embarrassed" myself ?
Who do you think you're talking to ?

157
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,440
I used HBO's money
to purchase and wear jeans

158
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,240
designed to give me
a sweet peach on television,

159
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,040
and not only did I publicly
release this photo to the world,

160
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,800
I put it on billboards
to promote this show.

161
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,520
That's in Times Square right now.
I am beyond the capacity for shame !

162
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,440
You can't hurt me.

163
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,320
The interesting thing about him
scolding me about our Modi show

164
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,960
is that that episode
didn't actually air in India.

165
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,000
A lot of our viewers over there
alerted us to the fact that Hotstar,

166
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,280
the streaming service
that broadcasts us in India,

167
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,200
never uploaded that episode.

168
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,680
There is no evidence that the Indian
government made them do that.

169
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,240
As best as we can tell,
Hotstar just decided to self-censor,

170
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,080
which is still not good.

171
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,320
And what's worse is, it's not the first
time that they have censored us.

172
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,520
They've been
quietly doing it for a while now,

173
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,480
not for the reason
you might expect.

174
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,440
Watch this clip from our show
about the census last year.

175
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,320
They made a small splice right after
we showed an ad from the 1980s.

176
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,880
It's subtle,
but just see if you can spot it.

177
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,640
- Can we count on you ?
- You can count on me !

178
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,240
Okay, first, I'll say this,
that is a beautiful song.

179
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,480
It's no "Eat Shit, Bob",
but frankly, what is ?

180
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,800
The concept
of the census is very simple.

181
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,880
Did you catch that ?
That barely noticeable moment

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,080
when they smashed
to an unflattering close-up of my face ?

183
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,520
You probably didn't,
because it fits so seamlessly

184
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,280
into the familiar rhythms
and consistent visual style

185
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,960
of this television show.

186
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,640
For the record, here is
what they actually cut out there.

187
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,000
Can we actually count on you,
Mickey ?

188
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,840
It's 1980, you're in a tuxedo
in the middle of the day

189
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,760
and your pupils are the size
of personal pan pizzas.

190
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,440
We all know what that means, Mick:
you've been baking with booger sugar,

191
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,160
horking the rawdilla, riding
the white rail express to Blowmaha.

192
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,800
What I'm trying to say here is:

193
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,440
Mickey Mouse has a really
serious cocaine problem.

194
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,720
I'm just stating a fact.
A Disney fact.

195
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,480
Yeah, they cut out a joke about
Mickey Mouse being a cocaine addict.

196
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,440
Why did they do that ?
It's hard to say.

197
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,200
But it might be because Hotstar
is actually owned by Disney.

198
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,480
And they seem extra-sensitive
about Disney references,

199
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,080
because we also spotted this edit in
our piece on China's one-child policy.

200
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,640
In the sixties and seventies,
overpopulation was a global concern,

201
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,400
with alarmists
making apocalyptic prediction.

202
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,800
The overpopulation hysteria was
global. And China was no exception.

203
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,760
Again: totally seamless and
barely noticeable as an edit.

204
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,080
Well done to everyone involved.

205
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,640
The joke they cut out of that
was about Donald Duck

206
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,880
and how his penis, this is true,
is shaped like a corkscrew.

207
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,720
And that's not even a joke,
by the way.

208
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,000
All ducks have corkscrew-shaped
dicks. Look at this one !

209
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,640
It looks like a freshly boiled
piece of al dente fusilli.

210
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,680
I resent that factually accurate
joke being cut out,

211
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,840
almost more than I resent
our Modi episode being pulled.

212
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,360
Let me say this to Hotstar now:
if you think that you have to remove

213
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,080
anything that reflects poorly
on Disney from this show,

214
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,440
I have some bad news for you,
my friends:

215
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,520
I'm fucking Zazu right here.

216
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,240
Everything that comes out
of this beak is a Disney fact.

217
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,640
If I say that Cogsworth collects
Nazi memorabilia, guess what ?

218
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,080
That's canon, baby, that's
a Disney fucking fact right there.

219
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,360
And for the foreseeable future,
Hotstar, you can look forward

220
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,640
to learning a lot more
of them on this show.

221
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,080
'Cause we're gonna be
sliding them into our stories

222
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,520
like Chip and Dale
slid into Richard Gere.

223
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,600
That's a Disney fact, motherfuckers.
And now this.

224
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,120
Larry Kudlow's Many Buts.

225
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,000
What he's saying is we're gonna
give you a respite here.

226
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,680
He's not going to take immediate
action to close the border

227
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,160
or the ports of entry and so forth,
but...

228
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,320
But, but, but, but.

229
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,920
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns law enforcement,

230
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,120
and specifically,
the job of sheriff.

231
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,120
That's not to be confused
with Cheriff,

232
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,080
the proper way to describe Cher
dressed liked a cowgirl.

233
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,000
That's a sheriff.
This is a Cheriff.

234
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,080
It's a key difference
you need to learn.

235
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,920
When you hear
the word "sheriff",

236
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,040
most of us
have two immediate associations.

237
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,640
One: western lawmen
who handle cattlerustlin',

238
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,640
and other livestock-related crimes.

239
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,520
And two: Joe Arpaio, the infamously
anti-immigrant sheriff.

240
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,840
This next clip actually includes both,

241
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,200
as Sheriff Joe gives
an update on a suspect

242
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,920
nabbed through
an interesting investigation.

243
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,720
Finally he decided that
he wanted to travel to Phoenix

244
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,560
to meet our undercover agent

245
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,720
and to have sex with his horse.

246
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,840
Yeah, now.
That sounds truly bizarre

247
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,080
until you realize that the horse
in question was this one.

248
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,680
So, you get it, right ?
I'm not saying I want to fuck a horse.

249
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,560
But if you are gonna fuck a horse,
it should definitely be this one.

250
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,960
Would I travel to Phoenix
to fuck that horse ? It depends.

251
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,160
How much are flights ? If it's
a $300 round trip, of course not.

252
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,240
But if it's $170 and the hot daddy
horse seemed open to it ?

253
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,880
Definitely.
My wife and I have a list

254
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,320
of five people that we're allowed
to have sex with.

255
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,440
Hers are all completely
understandable handsome, kind men

256
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,080
and mine are that horse,
five times.

257
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,200
So, it seems kind of ideal
as a situation. Anyway: sheriffs.

258
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,000
There are actually more than
3 000 of them around the country

259
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,560
and generally speaking, they run
law enforcement at a county level.

260
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,440
Cities or towns might have
their own police departments,

261
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,160
but in many areas, sheriffs are
the only law enforcement around.

262
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,200
And they oversee a lot of officers.

263
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,920
Around 25 percent of local officers
work for sheriffs.

264
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,080
That's one in four cops !
And depending on where you live,

265
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,040
your sheriff might be good, bad
or a total weirdo.

266
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,560
And I will not say which ones
are the weirdos

267
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,720
because that would be unfair
to Kenney Boone,

268
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,400
who until recently was sheriff
in Florence County, South Carolina,

269
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,840
where he made this incredible PSA.

270
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,560
They said one hit wouldn't hurt.

271
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,680
They said one hit wouldn't hurt.

272
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,920
They lied.
I'm Sheriff Kenney Boone.

273
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,120
Please, talk to
your kids about drugs.

274
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,120
Talk to your kids about drugs !

275
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,320
What are you doing ?
That is so magnificently weird.

276
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,160
I want 900 more versions of that
PSA where Kenney Boone implores us

277
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,160
to talk to our kids
about other things.

278
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,600
Talk to your kids about slugs.
Please, talk to your kids about rugs.

279
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,920
People, I'm begging you,
talk to your kids about pugs.

280
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,720
They said one lick wouldn't hurt.
They lied.

281
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,760
The role of sheriff is unique
because sheriffs are actually elected.

282
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,360
Which means
they often produce campaign ads.

283
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,040
A candidate in South Carolina
produced a frankly unforgettable ad.

284
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,760
You're about to think
that you know where this is going,

285
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,960
but you're gonna need to brace
yourself for a hard turn.

286
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,920
I want to tell you
at the start of my campaign

287
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,720
some things that politicians
would try to hide.

288
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,760
Things my opponents may try
to use to tarnish my integrity.

289
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,440
As a 16-year-old,
I received a ticket

290
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,280
for not having my driver's license
in my possession.

291
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,920
I've been in fender benders
that were my fault.

292
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,400
And about 10 years ago,
as a young police officer,

293
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,840
I attended a law-enforcement
Halloween party

294
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,080
dressed as ruthless drug kingpin,
Big Meech Flenory.

295
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,040
I did it to disparage a criminal whose
actions hurt our community and country.

296
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,320
That was a different time.

297
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,080
For the record,
the "different time" he's talking about

298
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,360
was 10 years ago,

299
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,560
when blackface was still widely
considered, and this is true, bad.

300
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,880
Once in office, sheriffs hold much
more power than you may realize.

301
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,720
With over a thousand
sheriff elections this year,

302
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,040
possibly where you live, we thought
tonight might be a good time

303
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,640
to take a look at this job.

304
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,000
And let's start with the fact
that in most states,

305
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,920
sheriffs' duties are enshrined
in the state constitution,

306
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,920
meaning that their job description
can have a certain old-timey flavor.

307
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,920
In many places, sheriffs can still
technically form a posse,

308
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,120
meaning that they can enlist volunteers
to help with tasks

309
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,400
ranging from providing security
to pursuing fugitives.

310
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,160
And those posse members
can be basically anyone,

311
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,840
which is how this actual
school shooting drill

312
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,480
came to include
an arguably famous face.

313
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,560
This is every parent's
worst nightmare.

314
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,600
Face down. Get on the ground.

315
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,120
These men are learning
how to fight the next school shooter.

316
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,760
You can't wait that long !

317
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:14,080
And oddly enough their coach is 1990s
action film legend Steven Seagal.

318
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,600
For every second that goes by,
you could have dead children.

319
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,640
Yeah !
That's Deputy Steven Seagal !

320
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,240
Watching Steven Seagal
conduct an active shooter drill

321
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,960
while discussing dead children

322
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,200
is a lot like looking at a picture
of Steven Seagal's current hair.

323
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,400
You immediately think to yourself:
"Highly unusual and upsettingly dark".

324
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,040
Still, one of the greatest powers
that sheriffs have

325
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,280
is to set law-enforcement
priorities in their county.

326
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,320
That in and of itself
is not entirely a bad thing.

327
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,600
Some sheriffs have advanced
genuinely progressive ideas,

328
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,400
like deprioritizing
low-level drug offenses,

329
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,240
or, in the case of one Texas sheriff,
fighting hard for bail reform.

330
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,120
75 percent of our population,
of the 83-hundred that we have

331
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,160
is there simply because
they're pre-trial detainees

332
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,000
and many are too poor to pay,
many non-violent offenders.

333
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,320
We need to find a way to make sure
they can stay with their families,

334
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,320
be held accountable still.

335
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,200
But no one can be held in jail
simply because they're too poor to pay.

336
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,640
He's right. That's fantastic,
he's absolutely right.

337
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,120
And hearing someone in uniform
say that is genuinely weird.

338
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,440
A good weird,
like eating a bacon doughnut,

339
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,000
or seeing how dogs walk when they
wear shoes for the first time.

340
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,520
Go get the ball !

341
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,520
Milo, come on !

342
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,160
Yeah, exactly:
weird, but good.

343
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,760
And by the way:
that sheriff is not just talk.

344
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,440
He implemented a cite and
release program for low-level offenses,

345
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,480
rather than booking people into jails,
which is great.

346
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,400
But obviously, sheriffs can
also go hard the other way.

347
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,240
Sheriff Joe prioritized immigration
enforcement to the detriment

348
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,320
of other concerns, like
investigating sexual assault.

349
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,960
Sheriff Richard Jones,
in Butler County, Ohio,

350
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,760
has refused to allow his deputies
to carry Narcan

351
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,480
to rescue people mid-overdose,
which is an incredible policy to adopt

352
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,920
in a place where, at one point,
overdoses were killing more people

353
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,560
than all other causes
of death combined.

354
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,080
Jones has argued that it is unsafe
for his officers to help revive people,

355
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,840
but the more he talks,
the less it seems that he thinks

356
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,600
those people are actually
worth reviving at all.

357
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,880
I'm not advocating
that people die

358
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,160
but I'm not advocating that
the police, this is their job.

359
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,840
I understand people that say
it's a disease,

360
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,600
I don't know that I believe
it's a disease.

361
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,160
Some people will equate it
like people that have cancer.

362
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,040
And I say, it's not.
People don't choose to have cancer.

363
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,440
The people with cancer
aren't stealing my air conditions,

364
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,960
the copper out of people's houses
and ripping the wires out.

365
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,000
That is clearly offensive. Not just
to those dealing with addiction,

366
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,720
but to people with cancer.

367
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,880
You think that they don't have
the ability to steal copper ?

368
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,800
People with cancer can grip it,
rip it and strip it

369
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,000
with the best metal
thieves out there.

370
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,800
Cancer patients have been

371
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,040
some of the best five-finger
copper shoppers that I know.

372
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,280
But the most significant duty
of a sheriff is that in most places,

373
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,680
they are the ones
operating the local jail.

374
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,080
They can have a ton of leeway
over how to do that.

375
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,200
Up until just last year, in Alabama,
sheriffs were legally allowed

376
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,760
to personally pocket any leftover
money designated to feed prisoners,

377
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,600
giving them a strong incentive to
skimp on inmate food, which happened.

378
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,480
The most spectacular example

379
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,080
was Sheriff Todd Entrekin
of Etowah County.

380
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,600
There had been accusations
of problems

381
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,400
with the quality and quantity
of food in his jails.

382
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,400
While he denied those allegations,
two years ago, it emerged

383
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,560
that he'd bought
a $740 000 beach house.

384
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,000
If that seems like a suspiciously large
purchase for someone with his salary,

385
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,960
this probably won't surprise you.

386
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,040
Over the last three years,

387
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,760
the sheriff's food program
has run under budget,

388
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,800
letting him pocket the leftovers.

389
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,160
$750 000,
all of it taxpayer money.

390
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,600
Do you agree that
the optics of this are terrible ?

391
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,240
The optics, yes.
But I can't change the optics.

392
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,360
I'd love for the optics to change.
I want to keep doing what I'm doing.

393
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,000
I just wish it would look better
when I did it.

394
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,760
Try and picture me
with sunglasses and a cool jacket.

395
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,640
Are the optics better, now ?
I like these better.

396
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,440
And bad jail conditions
obviously don't stop at food.

397
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,840
Take Sheriff Greg Ahern
of Alameda County, California.

398
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,160
More than 40 inmates have died
in his jails in the past five years.

399
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,280
29 female inmates have sued Ahern
over conditions and treatment,

400
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,800
with allegations ranging

401
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,600
from being put in a cell
with feces and blood on the walls,

402
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,640
to a woman
who says she screamed for hours

403
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,240
as she gave birth alone
in an isolation cell.

404
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,360
The sheriff has defended his facilities
and disputed those allegations,

405
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,080
though not
in a particularly convincing way.

406
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,640
When you hear people say:
"There was feces on the wall,"

407
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,560
"blood everywhere, and
tampons stuck everywhere",

408
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,160
does that make you angry ?

409
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,960
You mean the people
that are in custody for murder, rape,

410
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,240
robbery, who lied their entire life
and they make things up habitually ?

411
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,800
Okay, hold on.

412
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,520
The two women who made those
claims were not murderers or robbers,

413
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,600
they were in there on minor charges,
all of which were dropped.

414
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,400
Even if they were murderers, they
should still be treated humanely.

415
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,840
And third,
how do you whiff on the question:

416
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,360
"There was feces on the wall, blood,
does that make you angry ?"

417
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,680
That is one of the easier questions
to answer well, like:

418
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,400
"Is cake good ?"
or "Is this a fuckable horse ?"

419
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,520
The answer is yes.
It's obviously yes. Right ?

420
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,400
Look at me, yes. And at this point,
you may be wondering:

421
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,880
"How can sheriffs be reined in ?"

422
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,200
The problem there is that
that is actually very difficult.

423
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,280
While police chiefs
can be hired or fired,

424
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,720
removing a sheriff between
elections is almost impossible.

425
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,680
It requires a criminal conviction,
intervention from state government

426
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,800
or a recall vote, and those
are very rarely successful.

427
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,360
So, sheriffs operate
with a lot of impunity

428
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,720
and they can get pretty belligerent
if anyone questions them.

429
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,440
Remember Kenney Boone,
the sheriff who hated drugs

430
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,880
but loved yelling
at fake child funerals ?

431
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,080
When the county finance director
started asking about his spending,

432
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,040
Boone did not take it well.

433
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,040
Kevin, Kenney Boone again.
I don't know what your deal is

434
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,760
putting your nose
in other people's business...

435
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,480
Now all of a sudden you want
to question things that I do ?

436
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,400
You little nerdy,
intelligent bastard...

437
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,640
Payback's gonna be hell,
I promise you. Thank you.

438
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:47,560
Yes, Kenney, that's fantastic !
I would give anything to hear

439
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,040
the next voicemail
he left for that guy.

440
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,600
Kenney again,
ignore that last message,

441
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,080
I just wanted to say,
you're a bastard,

442
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,880
I don't think you're intelligent,
I think you're a nerdy, dorky...

443
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,040
Insightful individual. Damn it !
I blew it again, ignore this call too,

444
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,480
speak to you soon, talk to your kids
about drugs, love you, bye !

445
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,800
God dammit, Kenney.

446
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,280
You should know we reached
out to Kenney Boone's lawyer

447
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,120
and they said that they dispute
the authenticity of that voicemail.

448
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,800
The one where he says
he's Kenney Boone

449
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,600
while sounding exactly
like Kenney Boone.

450
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,080
We'd have discussed this difference
of opinion with Kenney Boone

451
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,560
but he wasn't available because,
fun fact, he's in jail right now.

452
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,680
He recently pleaded guilty
to felony embezzlement.

453
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,280
Which actually reminds me:

454
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,520
talk to your kids about
felony embezzlement !

455
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:46,280
The point here is, too often, sheriffs
are the law wherever they live.

456
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,600
If you're wondering:

457
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,680
"I don't even know who my sheriff
is, do I have a bad one ?"

458
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,040
The very fact that you're asking that
is kind of the problem here.

459
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,080
Sheriff elections,
like most down-ballot elections,

460
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,240
do not receive enough attention
and often they aren't even competitive.

461
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,440
In 2018, 59 percent of all sheriff
races were unopposed.

462
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,080
Remember Sheriff Ahern, with
the nightmarish-sounding jail ?

463
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,200
He's been unopposed for
the last four election cycles.

464
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,880
As for Sheriff "No Narcan", unless
someone steps up to challenge him,

465
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,240
he will be unopposed when
he runs for re-election this year.

466
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,640
Running against
an incumbent sheriff is not easy.

467
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,840
Their own employees are often loathe
to take them on, fearing retributions.

468
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,080
Because, as you have seen
tonight, they're very powerful.

469
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,160
But that cannot be allowed
to continue.

470
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,520
The same criminal justice reform
movement that's been putting

471
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,800
a spotlight
on district attorneys' races

472
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,840
is now increasingly focusing
on sheriffs' races, too.

473
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,640
And that is not
a moment too soon.

474
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,520
Right now, we have a position that
has a tremendous amount of authority

475
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,960
with low accountability, which is
an inevitable recipe for disaster.

476
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,600
So, if there is a sheriff's race
in your area this year,

477
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,320
now would be an excellent
time to start Googling

478
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,680
"Who the fuck is my sheriff ?"
and learning about them.

479
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,480
Otherwise, you might well wind up
seeing a campaign ad like this.

480
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Hi ! I'm Scott Wilkerson,
candidate for sheriff.

481
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,320
It's been my honor to serve
the people of this county

482
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,920
and I hope you'll re-elect me
as your sheriff.

483
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,080
But before my campaign begins,

484
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,400
I'd like to tell you some things
other politicians might try to hide.

485
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,840
I drink a lot.
I often drive while drunk.

486
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,080
I have what my therapist
calls a "hair trigger temper".

487
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,760
I don't like your attitude !

488
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,080
And as a younger man,

489
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,280
I did work as a Hitler
impersonator at birthday parties,

490
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,440
quinceaneras
and one disastrous bar mitzvah.

491
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,160
It was a different time.
But that's not all.

492
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,120
I spent much of the nineties
trying without success

493
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,800
to assassinate that little dog
from "Fraiser".

494
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,280
I have dabbled in what
you'd call light cannibalism.

495
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,120
I have never seen a frog
and not killed it.

496
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,360
In 2009, I contracted
the H1N1 virus,

497
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,960
better known as swine flu

498
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,320
and then drove to every Sizzler
Steak House in the state,

499
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,120
licked my fingers and dipped
them in the salad bar.

500
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,360
Why did I do this ?
Well, I love Sizzler

501
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,400
but beyond that, I do not know,
cannot tell you why.

502
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,560
Whenever there's a computer
in front of me,

503
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,680
I go to the Wikipedia page
for the Armenian Genocide

504
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,120
and just sort of tone it
down a bit.

505
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,760
I don't think it didn't happen,
I just think people are exaggerating.

506
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,320
I came up with the idea
for zucchini noodles.

507
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,160
In every single hotel room I have ever
stayed in, I have licked the phone,

508
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,720
ear part and mouth part,
that's both parts.

509
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,200
I give black people different
handshakes than I do white people,

510
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,960
whether they want it or not.

511
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,560
What else ?
Yeah ! I also fucked this horse.

512
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,200
I think it's okay, 'cause I traveled
out of state to do it.

513
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,280
Wasn't like a local horse
or anything.

514
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,240
I hope that with these confessions,
I have earned your trust.

515
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,680
It's been an honor to serve you
as sheriff for the past 42 years.

516
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,040
So, vote Sheriff Wilkerson
when you go to the polls

517
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,640
on November 3rd, 2020.

518
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,560
It's not like you have a choice,
because I'm running unopposed.

519
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,320
So, see you on the streets,
shitheads ! I'm dangerous !

520
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,640
That's our show, thanks for watching.
See you next week, goodnight !

521
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,360
Get them fish drunk.

522
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,440
Enjoy yourselves,
my fine finned friends.

523
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,840
I might try and catch
a duck today.

524
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,360
Fuck you, frog !

525
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,800
I also like strangling frogs.

526
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,800
Not just shooting at 'em.
I like killing them any ways.

527
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,120
LAST WEEK TONIGHT

528
