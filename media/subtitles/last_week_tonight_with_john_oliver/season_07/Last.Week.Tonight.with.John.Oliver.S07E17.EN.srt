00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,160
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,560
SEASON VII
EPISODE 17

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,040
Hi, welcome to the show, still
coming to you from this blank void.

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,120
It's been another eventful week, with
elections in New York and Kentucky,

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,680
plagued by long lines,
and the Trump administration

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,400
trying again to dismantle
the Affordable Care Act.

7
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,360
Because if there's one thing we have
too much of right now, it's healthcare.

8
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,040
And yet, the news has been dominated
by the coronavirus,

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,800
among other things, the worst thing
to happen to weddings since flash mobs.

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,680
U.S. is setting records for new cases
as the virus surges around the country.

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,760
Which makes it both startling
and frankly infuriating

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,720
that on Friday, the vice president
made this declaration.

13
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,000
We did slow the spread.
We flattened the curve,

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,240
we were able
to stand up the resources

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,840
and the capacities
in our healthcare system

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,240
to be able to meet
this coronavirus

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,800
in a way that would put the health
of all of our country first.

18
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,360
What ? That is just
such an open and stupid lie.

19
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,440
It's like, instead of saying, "Your dog
is on a farm upstate," your dad said,

20
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,520
"Your dog owns a farm upstate
that has the market cornered in

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,840
wholesale wheat and grain supplies
for the entirety of Saratoga County."

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,160
That's not true. The dog is dead
and so are over 120,000 Americans.

23
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,520
On top of that, Pence conspicuously
omitted "wearing a mask"

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,360
from advice that he gave for slowing
the spread of the virus.

25
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,120
And I will just never understand
why, or even how,

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,400
Republicans have made "not spreading
disease" into a culture war issue.

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,920
Honestly, this was a missed
opportunity for them.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,520
You could've printed "Make America
Great Again" on a billion red masks

29
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,600
and dropped them out of helicopters.

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,200
People would've worn them !

31
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,280
You're not capitalizing on a national
disaster correctly, you idiots.

32
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,280
The most aggressive states
about reopening for business,

33
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,680
like Texas and Florida,

34
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,400
are now seeing
some of the worst spikes in cases,

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,160
making their governors'
early proclamations of success

36
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,760
seem pretty ill-advised,

37
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,720
perhaps none more so than this,
from Ron DeSantis, just last month.

38
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,360
You've got
a lot of people in your profession

39
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,160
who waxed poetically
for weeks and weeks

40
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,880
about how Florida
was gonna be just like New York.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,640
"Wait two weeks, Florida's gonna be
next. Just like Italy, wait two weeks."

42
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,920
We're eight weeks away
from that and it hasn't happened.

43
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,280
Really ? As a general thought here:

44
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,720
I so badly want Ron DeSantis
to go on a lengthy tirade

45
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,200
about how he has never been hit
by lightning and never will be.

46
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,640
C'mon Ron-please. You show
that liberal lightning hoax who's boss.

47
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,560
The continuing spread of the virus
brings us to our main story tonight,

48
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,280
because we have a huge Covid-related
catastrophe that is around the corner.

49
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,360
Hundreds of tenants rallying this week
demanding rent relief.

50
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,200
The next few months could see the
largest number of eviction cases ever.

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,120
Yeah. As if things weren't already bad
enough, in the middle of a pandemic,

52
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,840
we may be about to see
evictions on the rise.

53
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,960
And on the list of things
you hope never to see on the rise,

54
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,080
evictions have to be right
up at the top-tied, of course,

55
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,800
with Larry King's penis.

56
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,040
That thing going up is not
what our current situation requires.

57
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,640
While evictions rising is shocking,
it was also completely foreseeable.

58
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,360
Coronavirus has played havoc
with employment,

59
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,160
making it difficult
for many to make rent,

60
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,000
which was always going
to have significant consequences,

61
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,280
given that about one-third
of U.S. households are renters,

62
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,000
and renters tend to have lower incomes
than homeowners in the first place.

63
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,160
And while stimulus checks,
expanded unemployment insurance,

64
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,440
and state and federal
moratoriums on evictions

65
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,080
undoubtedly helped
hold back the tide,

66
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,640
those mechanisms
are now starting to run out or expire.

67
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,560
And if we do nothing, experts
are predicting horrific outcomes,

68
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,880
with millions of people
left vulnerable.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is the worst economic crisis the
United States has seen in generations.

70
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,720
If nothing else changes
and evictions continue as normal,

71
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,560
this public health crisis will turn
into a full-blown homelessness crisis.

72
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,200
It's true-the coronavirus crisis

73
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,120
could also soon turn into a fullblown
homelessness crisis.

74
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,480
And it's hard to even fathom
something already so bad

75
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,440
transforming into something else
so appalling.

76
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,360
It's like finding out that Magikarp,

77
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,600
the worst PokÃ©mon for obvious reasons,
is set to evolve into Kevin Spacey.

78
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,240
I should've traded you for Psyduck
when I had the chance.

79
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,480
And it says something about the utter
absurdity of what's about to happen

80
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,480
that this is how some eviction hearings
will be taking place.

81
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,840
Starting with tomorrow's docket, Judge
Lopez will start hearing eviction cases

82
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,000
either in the court using webcams

83
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,720
with the defendant and the plaintiff
in separate rooms, over Zoom,

84
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,040
or even on the phone.

85
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,640
What are you doing ?

86
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,080
It might be worth thinking twice
about what you're taking part in,

87
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,120
if you're throwing people
out of their homes via Zoom,

88
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,920
a platform you're only using

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,880
because it's not safe for people
to leave their homes.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,120
Zoom shouldn't be where you find out
that you're getting evicted.

91
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,680
It should be where you find out
in a virtual happy hour

92
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,840
which one of your coworkers
has been secretly rich the whole time.

93
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,680
I'm sorry, Joanna has a chandelier ?
Where did she get chandelier money ?

94
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,320
Why don't I have chandelier money ?

95
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,480
Look, the fact is,
we're about to go out of our way

96
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,160
to throw people out of their homes
at the worst possible time.

97
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,880
And even in normal times,
evictions are incredibly damaging,

98
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,440
with long, long-term effects.

99
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,240
They've been linked
to heightened residential instability,

100
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,800
substandard housing, declines
in neighborhood quality, and job loss.

101
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,560
And on the individual level,
they can be completely devastating

102
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,720
in ways that you may not even realize,

103
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,600
from families losing their possessions
and having to start over,

104
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,800
to significant difficulties
in obtaining new housing,

105
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,160
something that can be hard to do
with an eviction on your record.

106
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,960
Evictions have consequences that can
haunt you for the rest of your life.

107
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,480
So tonight,
with rent due in just three days,

108
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,800
we thought it might be a good time
to talk about evictions.

109
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,760
Let's start with the fact
that the lack of affordable housing

110
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,880
is another problem that the coronavirus
has thrown into harsh relief.

111
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:33,000
Because it was a crisis in this country
long before the pandemic struck,

112
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,680
with rents so high
and renters so burdened

113
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,720
that stories like these
became a staple on local news.

114
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,680
A chaotic scene as hundreds
make a run for the door

115
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,520
and a chance
at Dallas County housing vouchers.

116
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,040
At least 8 people suffered injuries
while trying to line up this morning.

117
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,920
I saw people run,
so I started running

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,080
and I slipped and fell,
all over the pavement.

119
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,240
Jordan Spivey's all scuffed up after
taking quite a tumble this morning

120
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,520
but grateful
she wasn't trampled, too.

121
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,200
Holy shit !
No one should ever be trampled

122
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,920
by a crowd of people out of desperation
to get rental assistance.

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,520
There are only two times when trampling
is remotely acceptable:

124
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,120
the day after Thanksgiving,
America's national trampling holiday,

125
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,000
and whatever day in the future
the PS5 comes out.

126
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,640
I don't care that it looks
like an alien's waffle maker,

127
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,520
or a penguin designed by Apple.

128
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,400
It's gonna have "Horizon Forbidden
West" as an exclusive release,

129
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,320
and I will stomp anyone
who stands between me and that game.

130
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,240
I want to murder now dinosaur robots
with flaming arrows.

131
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,000
Now, that particular stampede
was nearly a decade ago,

132
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,800
but unfortunately, the problem
has only gotten worse since then.

133
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,480
Rents have risen significantly faster
than incomes,

134
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,720
to the point where,
for renters below the poverty line,

135
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,280
the majority are spending more than
half of their income on housing,

136
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,200
and a quarter
are paying 70 percent or more,

137
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,320
which is not remotely sustainable.

138
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,880
Meanwhile,
around a million households

139
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,480
have been evicted each year
for over a decade.

140
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,360
And all of this disproportionately
impacts people of color,

141
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,040
as Black households, for instance,

142
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,920
are twice as likely
as White households to face eviction,

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,400
and women of color particularly Black
women, are especially vulnerable to it.

144
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,320
So, things have clearly been bad
for a long time,

145
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,200
but once the pandemic hit, like
everything else, they got even worse.

146
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,000
And yet, you might have assumed that
there was a freeze on rent payments

147
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,520
if you listened to decomposing
melon Larry Kudlow,

148
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,360
laying out the Trump administration's
plans back in March.

149
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,160
Don't forget also, please:

150
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:33,560
regarding things like rent payments
or rental home loans,

151
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:39,200
all that will-evictions, let me add
that, all that will be put on hold.

152
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,560
There will be no evictions
during this period.

153
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,760
Now, that sounds great,

154
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,840
especially if what you took from it
was, "no rent, no evictions".

155
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,560
But that's not
actually what he's saying there.

156
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,080
The policy he's describing
only paused evictions, not rent.

157
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,080
Meaning that for those unable to pay,

158
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,920
the bills they owe have
just been piling up this whole time.

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,880
Also, the policy only applied
to certain properties,

160
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,000
like those with federallybacked
mortgages,

161
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,080
which account
for just a quarter of all rental units.

162
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,200
So, as far as comprehensive plans
to stem this crisis, it leaves a lot out.

163
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,920
Much the same way, in fact,
that Larry Kudlow's wife

164
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,960
leaves a lot out of her many paintings
of her husband's clothes.

165
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,800
Specifically,
what she leaves out is her husband.

166
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,920
Because, as we've mentioned
before on this show,

167
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,360
there is simply nothing
that she likes to do more

168
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,200
than paint her husband's ties over
and over and over and over again,

169
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,720
in a joyous celebration
of the absence of Larry Kudlow.

170
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,920
When we first brought this up,
months ago, we offered anyone

171
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,320
10 U.S. dollars, plus a $20,000
donation to their local food bank,

172
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,120
if they were willing to sell us
one of these Larry-less masterpieces.

173
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,480
Everything's been so busy

174
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,240
that we haven't had the chance to
reveal something to you, and that is...

175
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,520
We actually got one.

176
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:02,000
And the absence of Larry
is even more striking in person.

177
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,360
The federal moratorium on evictions
left a lot of people unprotected.

178
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,160
And while several dozen states
put in place their own moratoriums,

179
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,040
many of those protections
have already expired,

180
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,400
leaving renters in 23 states with no
state-level protection from eviction,

181
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,000
meaning many tenants are forced
to rely on the kindness of landlords.

182
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,000
Some of whom, to their credit,
have worked with their tenants

183
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,400
and reduced the rent owed

184
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,400
or have stepped up in even bigger ways,
like this guy.

185
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,800
Mario Salerno owns 80 apartments
in his hometown of Williamsburg.

186
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,640
He knows the pain
so many are going through.

187
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,680
So, he decided this month
to waive rent for everyone, everyone.

188
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,040
200 tenants
and he is not collecting.

189
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,560
For me, it was more important
for people's health,

190
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,960
and worrying about
who could put food on whose table.

191
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,640
Some tenants that said they can't work,
they didn't have money to pay me.

192
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,920
I says, "Don't worry about paying me.
Worry about your neighbor."

193
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,600
That's great ! That's very generous !
But unfortunately,

194
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,600
the solution clearly can't be to count
on everyone being like that guy.

195
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,320
If for no other reason
than if everyone was like that guy

196
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,520
we'd be forced
to make a "Sopranos" reboot

197
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,280
that was essentially
just "Oops! All Silvios."

198
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,600
And nobody wants that,
not even Silvio.

199
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,960
He balked at his brief tenure being the
skipper, he couldn't handle the crown.

200
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,000
Let's let him stay
where he's comfortable !

201
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,200
And the truth is,
rather than emulating that guy,

202
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,760
some landlords
have gone the opposite way,

203
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,200
even trying to threaten tenants
despite the protections in place.

204
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,440
Cortney is still in disbelief

205
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,120
as she reads through the most recent
emails from her landlord.

206
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,440
She says on March 31st she told
the landlord, who lives in Canada,

207
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,640
that April rent would be late;
days later...

208
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,480
"Just pay the rent or move out."

209
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,840
The emails started.

210
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,480
"You lying... "

211
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,800
"Both you and your grandmother
can go online and ... yourselves."

212
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,520
That isn't just horrifying,
it also effectively demolishes

213
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,440
every Canadian stereotype
I've previously held.

214
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,280
'Cause it seems
there is a new type of Canadian

215
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,600
that none of us have known about
and it's the hard-hearted bad boy

216
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,200
who tells you and your grandma
to go fuck yourselves.

217
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,320
Now, luckily, that woman's governor
had ordered a freeze on evictions

218
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,760
for those affected by Covid,
which covered her situation.

219
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,720
And when that local news reporter
pointed that out to her landlord,

220
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,840
his response was pretty remarkable.

221
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,880
He sent us a colorful email.
In it, he apologized for the profanity

222
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,200
and said he's willing to waive
her late fees plus half the April rent

223
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,880
which he would lose anyway
if he had to find a new tenant.

224
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,840
And, they can both get on with, quote,
"our miserable lives."

225
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,400
Whatever you think of that landlord's
behavior, I will say this:

226
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,560
that is objectively the correct way
to end any email in 2020.

227
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,640
"Happy virtual graduation !
Let's get on with our miserable lives."

228
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,160
"Congrats on the new baby !
Let's get on with our miserable lives."

229
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,480
"My deepest condolences
on the loss of your grandmother.

230
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,640
She lived a long and miserable life.
She'd want us to get on with ours."

231
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,000
Even when landlords and property
managers obeyed the moratoriums,

232
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,040
they often made it painfully clear

233
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,040
that tenants were gonna be evicted
at the first available opportunity.

234
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,640
I'm notoriously a landlord that doesn't
let tenants get by with any exception.

235
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,200
Even as court hearings
are temporarily on hold,

236
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,240
he's moving forward with filing
evictions and attempting to collect.

237
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,880
It's never fun throwing
throwing a single mother

238
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,520
and their three kids out
on the streets.

239
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,800
But it's business.

240
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,400
Okay, first of all: never say never.
What if the three kids in question

241
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,640
were Baby Hitler, Baby Stalin,
and Donald Trump Jr,

242
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,160
and their single mom
was Ghislaine Maxwell ?

243
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,600
That's a pretty fun eviction
right there.

244
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,520
That foursome could frankly use
a little time on the street.

245
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,840
But what is happening in that example
is actually really important.

246
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,200
Because many of those moratoriums
prevent the physical act of eviction,

247
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,240
but they don't stop the legal process
that leads up to it.

248
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,440
Many landlords
and property managers

249
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,200
have been able to file for evictions
in court this whole time.

250
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,680
Meaning, cases have just been
piling and piling and piling up.

251
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,240
And as soon as moratoriums are lifted,
which is happening in many places,

252
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,520
evictions could come fast.

253
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,880
Some landlords will tell you that the
current situation isn't their fault,

254
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,800
and that their tenants should've
somehow prepared better.

255
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,200
One property management company

256
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,000
made that argument
to a local Denver news crew,

257
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,040
who then played the audio
to one of the company's tenants,

258
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,440
and just wait
until you see his response.

259
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,240
I understand that everybody is in
a state of fear and panic right now,

260
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,160
but it's not the property
owners' responsibility.

261
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,520
We have to plan for a rainy day.

262
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,640
Everybody should be planning
for a rainy day.

263
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,160
Maybe you should've saved
for the rainy day. Just saying.

264
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,240
Yeah !
That's a fair point !

265
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,840
Why are renters consistently
the only ones being told

266
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,000
that they should've planned better ?

267
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,080
It's important to remember everyone
is in this crisis together right now.

268
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,800
And this isn't just a rainy day,
it's the great flood,

269
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,920
and one reason
no one has an umbrella

270
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,720
is 'cause it's not safe to reopen
the fucking umbrella factory yet.

271
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,040
In the face of an extreme crisis,

272
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:31,160
tenants are understandably calling for
drastic measures, like rent strikes.

273
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,120
We are out here today
to demand that the city, the state

274
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,680
and the federal government
cancel the rents.

275
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,960
We need rent cancellation.

276
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,280
Every month we're accumulating
more and more debt.

277
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,680
So, there's no way we're gonna
be able to repay that back.

278
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,760
A lot of us are already choosing
between food and rent.

279
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,400
We're saying to choose food.

280
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,120
The same way they bail out banks,

281
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,720
they should bail out
working families like mine.

282
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,120
Yeah, of course.
We should absolutely treat families

283
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,240
at least as well as we treat banks,
who can apparently, like Wells Fargo,

284
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,480
just re-establish themselves
whenever they get in trouble.

285
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,360
Next time your landlord asks you
for your last three months of rent,

286
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,040
why not tell them
that they're mistaken,

287
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,320
that rent was owed
by the previous you.

288
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,800
The current you was re-established
on July 1st of 2020

289
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,800
and you're ready for a fresh start.

290
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,960
Rent strikes are a risk.

291
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,000
Ultimately, you could end up
being evicted for non-payment,

292
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,280
which could make it harder
to get housing in the future.

293
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,320
Depending on your landlord's situation,
they might be unable to meet

294
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,640
property taxes that go toward
funding essential city services.

295
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,800
They are not
without consequences.

296
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,520
But, you can see why many
have been pushing for them,

297
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,640
or, indeed, for rent cancellation,
because people are desperate.

298
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,920
Strikes have been an effective way

299
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,680
of calling attention
to how dire things are now.

300
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,000
While, long-term, we need a plan
to fix our affordable housing crisis,

301
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,320
in the short term, we have to find
a way to keep people in their homes.

302
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,760
Although some cities are trying
to provide rental assistance,

303
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,320
the limited funds make it difficult
to address the scope of the problem.

304
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,120
Take Houston: they established
a $15 million rental relief fund.

305
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,600
This is what happened.

306
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,640
$15 million,
gone in just 90 minutes,

307
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,800
money dedicated to help families
pay their rent during this pandemic.

308
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,920
"We are not able to accept
your application..."

309
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,800
Rita and Trevor had applied for
18-hundred bucks in rental assistance.

310
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,320
They won't be getting that help,
though,

311
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,880
because by the time they applied
online this morning,

312
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,680
the money was already gone.

313
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,600
$15 million gone within an hour ?
Come on now.

314
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:47,000
Yeah, it's shocking to watch
$15 million disappear in 90 minutes.

315
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,480
Not quite as shocking
as watching $175 million disappear

316
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,600
in around the same time,
but still, you know, shocking.

317
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,760
The city of Houston knew going in
that this was gonna be an issue.

318
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,520
They even tweeted after the fact:

319
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,080
"We understand this is nowhere
near enough"

320
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,280
"to meet the need
of all Houstonians."

321
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,120
The city directly encouraged people
to reach out to their representatives

322
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,080
to advocate for greater funding.

323
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,240
The truth is, cities can only do
so much without federal intervention,

324
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,480
they have the same amount of power
as the servants of Downton Abbey.

325
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,320
Sure, they'll do what they can,
but at a certain point,

326
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,280
when things get really bad, they're
gonna have to take this shit upstairs.

327
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,160
Now, in a much bolder move,
the City of Ithaca, New York,

328
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,800
is currently in the process
of trying to cancel rent

329
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,120
for those affected by this pandemic
and is calling on the state

330
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,160
to provide funding
for landlords who need relief.

331
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,480
And that is an interesting idea.
Although, again, it requires

332
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,600
the people upstairs, like the state
and federal government, to act.

333
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,320
Unfortunately, they have dragged their
feet on offering solutions for renters

334
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,240
that remotely meet
the scale of this crisis.

335
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,080
Back in May, to its credit,
the House passed the Heroes Act,

336
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,560
which provided $100 billion in rental
assistance for the most vulnerable.

337
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,360
Unfortunately, since then,
the bill has stalled out in the Senate,

338
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,640
which is frankly no surprise,
as multiple high-level Republicans

339
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,080
have expressed their reticence
to pass another relief package.

340
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,880
I think that many people
would like to just pause for a moment

341
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:24,840
and take a look at the economic impact
of this massive assistance program.

342
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,960
If the economy continues the momentum
that we're beginning to see,

343
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:34,160
that might conclude that the stimulus
that we've already passed is enough.

344
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,960
We need to assess
what we've already done,

345
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,200
take a look at what worked
and what didn't

346
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:47,000
and we'll discuss the way forward
in the next couple weeks.

347
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,440
In a couple of weeks ? Really ?

348
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,960
Well, here's the thing:
that was back in May.

349
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,640
We're now at the end of June,
nothing has been passed

350
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,920
and rent is due
on fucking Wednesday.

351
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,440
I do know that time
simply does not function the same way

352
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,600
for Mitch McConnell
as it does for everyone else.

353
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,280
For us, today is June 28th,
but for him,

354
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,160
based on the way that he thinks,
speaks and behaves,

355
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,360
the current date is somewhere
around May 12th, 1853.

356
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,840
And look: the sad truth is,
we've already waited too long here.

357
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,560
There is absolutely no excuse
for not attacking this problem

358
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,880
with real urgency.

359
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,080
While we wait for Congress to act,

360
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,640
people like this woman are having
to deal with the consequences.

361
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,480
Kianah Ashley is being evicted
and a nightmare is unfolding

362
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,000
for her and her five-year-old son,
Nazir.

363
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,080
That's something I wouldn't wish
on my worst enemy

364
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,200
because not knowing where you're going
to rest your head at for the next day,

365
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,880
that's not good.

366
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,440
Yeah, of course it's not good.

367
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,840
Everyone deserves
the basic stability of shelter.

368
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,720
If you've begun to despise

369
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,680
the house that you've been shut inside
for the past three and a half months,

370
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,320
it is worth remembering,
the only thing worse

371
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,440
than knowing you'll spend another
day stuck under the same roof

372
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,760
is not knowing that.

373
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,160
While there are clearly
no perfect options here,

374
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,560
the very worst thing that we could do
right now is nothing.

375
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,320
Because every day we fail to act
is a day that we're compounding

376
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,800
another future crisis for millions
of vulnerable renters and communities.

377
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,320
We need to stop
this before it gets even worse,

378
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,800
and in the long term, we badly need
to solve our affordable housing crisis.

379
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,200
Because then, and only then, if I may
quote the world's rudest Canadian,

380
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,000
can we all get on
with our miserable lives.

381
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,560
And now, this.

382
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,440
The Citizens Of Palm Beach County,
Florida,

383
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,680
Have Some Thoughts
On Mandatory Face Masks.

384
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,800
My name is Butch
and I'm an American patriot.

385
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,720
See that flag ?
I would die for that flag.

386
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,200
Now, there is so much evidence.
CDC itself said they made a mistake.

387
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,200
There's not enough to make this
a pandemic. This is a planned-demic.

388
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,600
You can not mandate somebody
to wear a mask

389
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,720
knowing that that mask
is killing people.

390
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,360
Our Amazon Prime driver
was so weak from wearing his mask,

391
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,720
he begged my husband for Advil
and water.

392
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,560
He said: "This mask is killing me".

393
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,120
They want to throw God's wonderful
breathing system out the door.

394
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,600
We've been harassed, defamed,
humiliated, discriminated.

395
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,120
I'll get discriminated
against everywhere I go,

396
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,520
even more than I already am.

397
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,320
I'm also the daughter of somebody
who lived through Germany.

398
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,320
I know a lot of stories. And this
is sounding very familiar to me.

399
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,960
How will young children be able to know
who the dangerous deviants are

400
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,600
like pedophiles and people
into human sex trafficking ?

401
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,760
This is our right to not wear anything
to cover our faces or hold our breath.

402
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,760
I would die for that country.
I would die for the Constitution.

403
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,480
You know what ? You disgrace me !
'Cause I would die for that flag.

404
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,520
I'm not wearing it today. Besides,
despite what you guys do up here today,

405
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,880
I'm not wearing one tomorrow.

406
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,840
I was born free, I will stay free.
My rights come from God, not from you.

407
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,000
You're gonna have to hold me down
and put it on me.

408
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,600
I don't wear a mask for the same
reason I don't wear underwear.

409
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,120
Things gotta breathe.

410
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,600
Moving on. Finally tonight,
another quick look at social media,

411
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,800
that place where Zac Efron
once tweeted:

412
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,640
"I'm thankful
for a couple things today:"

413
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,160
"Martin Luther King Jr
and 10 million followers on Instagram."

414
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,240
It is a mixed bag.
You might remember last week,

415
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,920
we talked about how K-pop fans
have been using social media

416
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,920
to drown out racists online
and do some good in the world.

417
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
This week, we're gonna talk
about the exact opposite of that.

418
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,560
Because it turns out,
TikTok has a brand-new star

419
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,720
and it is the last person you want.

420
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,280
Yeah, that is John Schnatter,
otherwise known as "Papa John",

421
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,600
riding a tiny tricycle around
to a Megan Thee Stallion song

422
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,680
and asking:
"Am I doing this right ?"

423
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,360
And obviously,
no, you're not.

424
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,440
But also, you do know
what that means, teens:

425
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,480
TikTok is officially shitty now.

426
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,720
Shitty now !

427
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,200
You always knew
that it was just a matter of time

428
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,280
before some middle-aged white guy
ruined your favorite online thing,

429
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,480
but I'm guessing that you didn't know
it was gonna happen like this.

430
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,280
That's honestly just one of many posts
that Papa John has shared

431
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,800
since significantly boosting his
social media presence late last year.

432
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,760
He's used TikTok
and Instagram to do things

433
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,560
like give people a tour of his house,
which, by the way, is something.

434
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,440
Howdy. Papa John.
Welcome to my crib.

435
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,960
Start off with the clock.
Eagles go up several thousand feet.

436
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,800
They mate all the way down.
Right before they hit the earth,

437
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,400
they separate so they
don't get hurt or killed.

438
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:58,160
Perfect timing, eagles mating clock,
spins four times an hour.

439
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,760
Setting aside the neo-classical
ejaculation that is his home,

440
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,600
that is one hell of a statement
entryway piece.

441
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,320
Not to be pedantic, but we looked
into it and that's not how eagles mate.

442
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,880
Courtship displays take place in flight
but eagles do not mate in the air.

443
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,720
What you're thinking of
is Cirque du Soleil performers.

444
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,880
They're the ones who trapeze-fuck
the shit out of each other way up high.

445
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,040
Eagles, however, have sex in a nest
or on a tree branch.

446
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,160
Not saying the man
behind a pizza empire

447
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,840
should have a nuanced
understanding of eagle fucking.

448
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,480
By making that the first thing
that greets visitors into your house,

449
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,240
you kind of are presenting
yourself as an expert.

450
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,280
But wait, because part two of his tour
was a glimpse into his office.

451
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,160
This is the bishop's chair
out of a church in Italy.

452
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,400
We think that it's about
500 years old.

453
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,280
It's one of my favorite sayings:

454
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,800
"All the best have something
in common, a regard for reality."

455
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,400
Hold on. It seems Papa John
printed out his favorite saying,

456
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,880
framed it, and then placed it
in the middle of a desk,

457
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,040
where it looks less like words
of inspiration

458
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,760
and more like the WiFi password
at a coffee shop.

459
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:12,080
That quote is by Polish Nobel Prize
winner Wislawa Szymborska

460
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,160
who was commenting on the excesses
of postmodern literature.

461
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,040
The incongruity of reading
a 20th-century Polish poet's quote

462
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,440
about the value of staying grounded
while standing in front

463
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,720
of a five-century-old bishop's chair
in your 40 000 square foot pizza castle

464
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,320
is matched only by the incongruity
of thinking

465
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,560
that showing people this in the midst
of a historic economic collapse

466
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,200
would be good PR for you.

467
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,040
Because to be clear: Papa John's
sudden social media presence

468
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,600
is part of a concerted PR campaign
to repair his image.

469
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,800
An image, by the way,
that needs quite a lot of repairing.

470
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,400
Just to refresh your memory here:
Papa John had to leave his company

471
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,720
following a series
of controversies and scandals,

472
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,120
from his 2017 comments that his
company's sales had been hurt

473
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,840
by NFL leadership not clamping
down hard enough

474
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,000
on players protesting
police brutality, to this.

475
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,440
Founder and face of Papa John's Pizza
is apologizing and admitting

476
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:09,080
that a report he used the n-word
on a conference call in May is true.

477
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,040
Yeah, he apparently used
the n-word on a conference call.

478
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,960
And not just any conference call,
either,

479
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,640
during a role-playing exercise focused
on averting public relations crises.

480
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,680
Which, in terms of contexts
in which to say that word,

481
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,360
is far and away the worst, tied only
with every other context.

482
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,240
Ever since, Papa John has tried
to offer explanations for his behavior,

483
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,080
arguing that the conference call
was leaked

484
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,360
as a part of a conspiracy
to remove him from his company

485
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,160
and that he only used that slur

486
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,000
in the course of explaining
that he doesn't use it.

487
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,200
An argument
he's tried to make repeatedly,

488
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,200
like in this interview,
where he attempts to prove

489
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,800
that he's not a fan of the n-word,
in the weirdest imaginable way.

490
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,120
If I go to dinner and somebody
uses that word, one time,

491
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,640
and I'll get up and leave dinner.

492
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,080
I've done that, more than once.
But, it's just not a good word.

493
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah, nothing says:
"I'm not a racist"

494
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,520
like repeatedly making dinner plans
with people who might say the n-word

495
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,120
and then leaving
once they do in fact say it.

496
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,720
I didn't realize there was a more
repulsive type of Papa John's dinner

497
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,400
than this kind, but it turns out
that I was wrong.

498
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,880
And now, by his own admission,
Papa John is posting on social media

499
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,760
at the suggestion
of his brand new PR team.

500
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,680
And one of the things that
he's doing is trying to take ownership

501
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,640
of the jokes made at his expense.

502
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,280
That interview you just saw
was him appearing on a podcast

503
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,560
whose host has made fun of him
for years,

504
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,960
mocking him
with the phrase "Papa Bless",

505
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,080
which he is now trying to reclaim,
selling t-shirts with the phrase on it

506
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,480
and also releasing
thirsty online content like this.

507
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,840
Papa Bless ? Or Papa Flex ?

508
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,760
I hate that so much.

509
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,720
There is something frankly insulting
about him thinking

510
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,640
that everyone's gonna be happy
to simply forget his past

511
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,440
just because he's doing
wacky things on the internet.

512
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,920
That is why it's been reassuring to see
how some people have responded.

513
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,160
If you click to see if anyone
reacted to that TikTok,

514
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,560
you will see plenty of people making
disapproving faces or mocking him.

515
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,480
Or, in my favorite example, this man
captioning his disapproval with:

516
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,240
"Get off my feed
little racist pizza man."

517
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,000
"Your home is ugly
and you have bad taste."

518
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,800
Which is absolutely excellent.
And to that man, I say:

519
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,360
kudos for doing in 10 seconds what
has taken me five minutes to do.

520
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,560
That is our show.
We'll be back on July 19th.

521
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,080
Until then, good night !

522
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,640
No. No, absolutely not.

523
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,000
No, this isn't fun.
You're not being fun right now.

524
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,840
Papa stop.
Papa stop right now.

525
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,440
This is grotesque.
That doesn't even look heavy.

526
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,800
