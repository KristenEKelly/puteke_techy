LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,280
SEASON VII
EPISODE 16

3
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,200
Hi, there.
Welcome to the show.

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,960
Still taking place in this
empty, blank void.

5
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,760
There's no one in the room
with me right now.

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,760
Although, interestingly, that's still
somehow only slightly fewer people

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,760
than were at President Trump's
Oklahoma rally last night,

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,160
which was half empty despite
his campaign claiming

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,800
a million people had requested tickets
and even building an outdoor stage

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,560
so he'd be able to do a second speech
to the thousands that couldn't get in.

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,680
That speech turned out
to be very much unnecessary.

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,560
So few people turned up, in fact,
that even Pink was tweeting:

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,000
"I think I sold that place out in five
minutes hashtag #donkeyshow".

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,200
And it's never a great sign
when, as president,

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,240
you're getting dunked on by Pink.

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,520
As for the rest of this week, large,

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,360
peaceful Black Lives Matter protests
continued around the country,

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,360
John Bolton tried to sell the things he
should've said freely before Congress

19
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,520
and on Friday,
it was Juneteenth,

20
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,640
which a large segment
of white America both celebrated

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,160
and learned about
for the very first time.

22
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,200
Now, not all of the Juneteenth
commemorations were appropriate.

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,720
SnapChat chose the day
to release their brand-new filter

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,480
that enabled people to break chains
simply by smiling,

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,680
which is not ideal
and which they quickly pulled.

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,400
And then,
there was whatever the fuck this is.

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,960
As our country works through the racial
issues that we still face today,

28
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,000
it is important to remember
we are one global community.

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,440
Let's all agree that any differences
we have

30
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,960
should be celebrated
and learned from.

31
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,120
Yes, that is Melania Trump giving her
version of a Juneteenth address

32
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,680
yes, she is doing it between
two 20-foot golden candelabras,

33
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,360
no, the camera doesn't punch in
for a closer shot

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,240
and yes, I'm pretty sure this does
qualify as a hate crime in 12 states.

35
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,880
But instead of focusing on that,
let's move on.

36
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,200
Because our main story tonight
concerns the coronavirus.

37
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,760
The thing you have to regularly
convince your parents still exists.

38
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,440
You went to a Shoney's, did you ?
Who else was there ?

39
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,480
The whole town ? Please stay
inside, you extremely fragile maniacs.

40
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,040
In recent weeks, there's been
alarming spikes all over the country.

41
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,000
But one particular kind of place
has been getting hit especially hard.

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,520
Prisons are seeing
an alarming spike.

43
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,680
Data collected by "The New York Times"

44
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,960
shows the number of inmates infected
is above 68 000.

45
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,040
That's doubled over the last month.

46
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,000
Prison deaths tied to the virus have
risen by 73 percent since mid-May.

47
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,280
The five largest clusters of the virus
are in correctional institutions.

48
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,560
Yeah, it's true. The five largest
clusters of coronavirus

49
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,560
are correctional institutions.

50
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,200
Which is so terrible, it sounds
like an announcement produced

51
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,800
by some sort of bad news generator
that spits out random sentences like:

52
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,880
"Confederate statue inks
10 episode deal with Quibi"

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,400
or "TikTok hamster charged with four
counts of vehicular manslaughter",

54
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,040
or "Sean Hannity
dating Ainsley Earhardt."

55
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,120
One of those is real
and it's the worst one.

56
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,640
And the fact that coronavirus
is rampaging through prisons and jails

57
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,840
is especially alarming given that
there are 2.2 million people

58
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,800
being held in them
across the country.

59
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,720
Inmates are generally a group
with higher health risks.

60
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,760
Between 1999 and 2016, the number
of people 55 or older in prison

61
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,560
has increased 280 percent.

62
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,120
And people inside jails are more likely
to be immuno-compromised

63
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,440
with chronic health issues like
diabetes and hypertension.

64
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,960
This is an immensely
vulnerable population

65
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,840
and inmates very much know that,
as this advocate explains.

66
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,080
I am in contact with more than
300 people who are incarcerated.

67
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,520
They report to me
day in and night out.

68
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:10,560
"Louis, this is like me standing
in the middle of I-95 in New York,"

69
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,280
"right in the middle of the road
and cars zipping by me"

70
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,760
"at 117 miles an hour
in both directions."

71
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,240
"And it's just a matter of time
before I'm hit with this thing."

72
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,600
Inmates feel like it's just a matter
of time before they get sick.

73
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,760
Terrible, because we don't punish
people by giving them diseases.

74
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,080
Take me, for instance.
I don't have Lyme disease

75
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,600
because of my 2008
public intoxication charge.

76
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,400
I have it because those deer
knew how to fuckin' party back then.

77
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,720
I gotta be honest,
I miss that crew.

78
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,280
So tonight,
let's talk about a few things:

79
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,200
why the coronavirus
has spread so rapidly behind bars,

80
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,720
the impact that has
on absolutely everyone

81
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,440
and what we can and should
be doing about it.

82
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,960
As a quick refresher:
jails are where people are detained

83
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,680
while awaiting trial
or held for minor sentences,

84
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,600
while prisons typically hold
people who've been convicted

85
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,080
and are serving sentences
of more than a year.

86
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,880
Whether you're in a jail or a prison,
you are probably in a facility

87
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,360
that is in no way built to cope
with a crisis like this,

88
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,520
'cause it's basically impossible
to keep six feet apart in a tiny cell,

89
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,760
as Ted Koppel found out
a few years ago.

90
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,000
Confinement and social distancing
are mostly incompatible.

91
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,240
You don't have a hell of a lot
of room in here, do you ?

92
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,240
One person can only move
at a time.

93
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,240
Like if I'm...
We had to turn sideways.

94
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,280
Right. It's hard to practice
social distancing

95
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,120
when you live in what's basically
a closet with two beds and a toilet.

96
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,680
I'd argue you can't practice
most things under those circumstances

97
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,040
apart from games like "Let's try
not to accidentally hug each other"

98
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,960
and "Who can poop
the quietest ?"

99
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,920
Incidentally, the correct answer to
that last question is Blake Lively.

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,880
She poops the quietest.
That is simply a fact.

101
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,120
And some of the steps authorities have
taken to deal with this problem

102
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,320
are ridiculously small, as this worried
mother of one prisoner explains.

103
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,440
They're being locked down for
like 23 and a half hours a day.

104
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,800
They get to come out for 10 minutes
and use the phone,

105
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,600
take their shower
and then go back in.

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,200
And those small cells, they're telling
them to sleep from head to foot.

107
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,880
Even from head to foot,
if you're in a small cell,

108
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,640
it doesn't make a difference.

109
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,520
Exactly. And that's probably not
comforting for a mother to hear !

110
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,040
Don't worry, Mom. All prisoners
are instructed to sleep head to foot

111
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,200
and when they're awake, we tell them
to breathe in opposite directions.

112
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,600
We're pretty sure
we've got this covered.

113
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,280
Then there's the simple issue
of soap. As everyone knows by now,

114
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,800
a key way to protect against
the coronavirus

115
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,920
is by regularly
washing your hands.

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But in jails and prisons, soap may be
rationed or not available at all.

117
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,120
If inmates need more, they may have
to buy it from the commissary.

118
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,840
As we have covered before
on this show,

119
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,880
despite doing most of the work
to keep prisons and jails running,

120
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,320
inmates only make
pennies for their labor.

121
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,880
Some facilities have even posted signs
about the importance of hand-washing

122
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,200
but continued to charge inmates
for access to soap.

123
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,080
And multiple prisoners have felt they
needed to go out of their way

124
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,120
to try and alert the world
to this dangerous shortage.

125
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,200
This is what they gave us,
this little-ass thing of soap

126
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,840
to stay clean, like, wash
our hands and shit.

127
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,640
And this is for every two weeks.

128
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,560
They are not giving us hand sanitizer.
They are not giving us proper soap.

129
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,600
This is the soap dish
that's in our bathroom.

130
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,080
It's just pieces of soap that everybody
got to wash their hands with.

131
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,080
We have two soap dispensers

132
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,360
but sometimes on a weekend,
the soap runs out.

133
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,880
That is clearly awful. There
should always be enough soap.

134
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,520
If you wanted
to do a decent parody of me,

135
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,040
you wouldn't be too far off
if you slapped on a suit,

136
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,360
faked a British accent
and went around shrieking:

137
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,640
"There should
always be enough soap."

138
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,280
But that doesn't make it
any less true, does it ?

139
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,040
There should always be
enough fucking soap !

140
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,040
Especially at that last facility,
at which, as of April,

141
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,160
about 80 percent of its residents
had contracted the virus.

142
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,000
And it's by no means just cleaning
products that are scarce.

143
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,440
PPE is in such short supply

144
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,280
it's led to prisoners wearing socks
on their hands when they use the phone,

145
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,840
which might be the saddest
sock puppet ever,

146
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,400
and testing has been so lacking
that inmates can't be confident

147
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,600
about who does
and doesn't have the virus.

148
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,280
On top of that,
if someone does show symptoms,

149
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,080
they're often placed
in solitary confinement,

150
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,760
because prisons have nowhere else
to quarantine them.

151
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,600
And it's not a great incentive
for inmates to come forward

152
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,960
if your policy is basically:
"Just tell us that you're sick"

153
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,800
"and we'll put you
in the special punishment hole."

154
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,680
When you take all of this together,

155
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,200
the close quarters,
the lack of basic protections

156
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,640
and the uncertainty about the
spread of a potentially deadly virus,

157
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,160
it's no surprise that tensions
can hit a breaking point.

158
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,000
This is what happens when
the coronavirus is killing...

159
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
After three o'clock
Thursday afternoon,

160
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,160
an inmate took cell phone video

161
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,520
inside the C-block of
the Lansing Correctional Facility.

162
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,320
Property destroyed,
inmates out of their cells.

163
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,160
Inmates complaining
of conditions due to Covid-19.

164
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,360
Don't want to give us no healthcare ?
This is what we do.

165
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,120
All you had to do was give us
some motherfucking healthcare.

166
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,360
Yeah. And if anyone is thinking
that that's an extreme response,

167
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,720
I'd simply ask this: what else
are they supposed to do ?

168
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,360
What other bargaining chip do prisoners
have at their disposal right now ?

169
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,440
This has been a bit of a recurring
theme lately, but I'll say it again:

170
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,760
if it takes the destruction of property
for a system to pay attention

171
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,960
to human lives, then we are
in a dark fucking place.

172
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,680
If you are fortunate to have little to
no familiarity with the prison system,

173
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,280
it can be easy
to ignore this problem.

174
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,000
That attitude is reflected
by some in local government.

175
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,240
In California, when an outbreak
in a Santa Barbara prison

176
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,800
made it difficult to meet the state's
standards for reopening,

177
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,680
local officials proposed simply
not counting the prisoners,

178
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,600
with a spokesman saying the individuals
are not out in the community,

179
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,320
so "it's really
a whole separate population."

180
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,600
Which is the kind of thing
you should only really be saying

181
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,160
if there was a coronavirus
outbreak in Atlantis.

182
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,640
They don't even breathe air
down there !

183
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,280
They're really
a whole separate population.

184
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,920
The director
of the Arkansas Department of Health

185
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,440
tried to put an even more optimistic
spin on the prison outbreaks there.

186
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,680
These are high-risk settings

187
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,360
where Covid-19 can spread
very easily, very rapidly.

188
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
But they're also closed systems

189
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,160
and they don't necessarily represent
the situation in Arkansas in general.

190
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:49,040
A fortunate thing about that setting
is that it's not hard to contain it

191
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,720
because people aren't
going out and about,

192
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,400
they're not leaving the prison.

193
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,040
Even if prisons and jails
were closed systems,

194
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,080
which they are very much not,
for reasons we're about to get into,

195
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,400
it's weird to call outbreaks
of a deadly virus "fortunate"

196
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,800
just because
they're confined to one place.

197
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,240
The news didn't go insane
covering Balloon Boy

198
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,920
because they were stoked it was
just one boy contained

199
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,640
in a homemade balloon
careening through the sky.

200
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,440
No, it was treated
as an emergency

201
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,000
'cause there was a chance
he was gonna fucking die.

202
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,600
Thankfully, of course, there turned
out to be zero boys in that balloon,

203
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,560
as it was later revealed to be
a hoax pulled off by the boy's parents

204
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,600
in order to make the family, who had
appeared on "Wife Swap,"

205
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,320
more marketable to the media.

206
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,520
Remember when Balloon Boy was the
craziest story you had to worry about ?

207
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,440
2009 truly was a simpler time
to be alive.

208
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,040
For the record,

209
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,440
people are absolutely going
"out and about" from prisons.

210
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,080
Because not everyone in a prison
is in prison.

211
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,680
There are around 445 000
non-inmate staff personnel

212
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,680
working in prisons
across the country

213
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,280
and those workers have reported
over 9 000 coronavirus cases.

214
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,080
We might as well be handing them

215
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,920
coronavirus gift bags as
they leave work every day

216
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,880
and head back out
into the community.

217
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,040
And staff bringing the virus
in and out of facilities

218
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,880
isn't the only way
that it can spread.

219
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,400
It can hop from prison to prison
as inmates are transferred around.

220
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,240
It can also get out into the community
when sick prisoners

221
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,960
are treated at local hospitals,
particularly in rural areas,

222
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,240
where hospitals can easily
get overwhelmed.

223
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,640
And that is before we get into jails,

224
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,320
where there is a constant
churn of people moving in and out.

225
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,800
In a typical week,
more than 200 000 people

226
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,000
are booked into jails
across the country

227
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,760
and another 200 000 walk out.

228
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,000
Outbreaks in prisons and jails can
spread to the larger community.

229
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,800
One study suggested that,
as of mid-April,

230
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,400
more than 15 percent of all documented
coronavirus cases in Illinois

231
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,280
could be linked to just one facility,
the Cook County Jail.

232
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,400
While the jail strongly
disputes those findings,

233
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,960
there were activists who saw
the danger signs early on,

234
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,880
like this man, who was
warning people back in March.

235
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,680
As of right now, Cook County Jail
is a virtual petri dish.

236
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,360
Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart, he is
the captain of a death cruise ship.

237
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,320
A "death cruise ship".

238
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,360
Cruise ships are already
comfortably bad enough

239
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,840
without bringing death
into the equation.

240
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,960
Like if our parent company rebranded
themselves as "Genocide AT&T".

241
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,720
Guys, I don't know how you could
possibly make a worse experience

242
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,640
than the one that
you're already providing people.

243
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,800
Coronavirus doesn't stay behind bars.
It travels easily.

244
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,280
Which brings us to our final question:
what can we do ?

245
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,520
Realistically,
we need to be getting

246
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,400
as many people out of prisons
and jails as possible,

247
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,680
which is something
we should be doing anyway.

248
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,600
But right now, we really
don't have much of a choice.

249
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,480
The fewer people in these facilities,

250
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,080
the easier it will be for
those people to socially distance,

251
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,000
the fewer staff you'll need on site
and the lower your demand for PPE.

252
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,600
Whenever anyone suggests
releasing inmates,

253
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,880
this is the inevitable response.

254
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,160
The public just doesn't want
to have a thousand burglars,

255
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,360
thieves and identity forgers
and others out on the street.

256
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,960
We've got enough top-problems
watching our homes and business,

257
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,120
purses and wallets right now,
we don't need any more of this.

258
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:27,120
First off, taxidermied George Lucas,
you seem to be struggling to think

259
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,400
of more than one kind
of criminal there.

260
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,640
Burglar, thief, identity forger,
those are all synonyms for stealing.

261
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,160
What about all
the other criminals in Texas,

262
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,680
like the man who posed
as a Beto O'Rourke volunteer,

263
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,440
broke into someone's home
and took a Popsicle ?

264
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,880
Or the man who was forced
to return $3 000 in prize money

265
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,920
for cheating
in bass fishing contests ?

266
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,520
Or even the woman who drank
wine out of a Pringles can

267
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,160
while driving an electric cart
around a Walmart parking lot ?

268
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,560
Texas has a vibrant crime scene

269
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,120
with a lot more variety than
you're giving it credit for.

270
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,520
There are some people we have no
excuse for not releasing immediately.

271
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,520
Especially those awaiting trial in jail
who pose little risk to public safety

272
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,880
and are only there because
they couldn't afford to post bail.

273
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,880
I am not saying that every person

274
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,280
who's let out due to the coronavirus
will behave perfectly.

275
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,160
No one can say that. I'm sure
that you will see people on TV

276
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,240
citing isolated cases of people who
were released and then did bad things.

277
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,560
You'll see that on "Crime Porn
for Old Whites with Laura Ingraham"

278
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,760
or "They're Coming for You !
with A Human Squash Court."

279
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,200
But on balance, the risks
of carefully letting people out

280
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,840
are vastly outweighed by the risks
of leaving everyone inside.

281
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,880
As for prisons, the bare minimum
we should do is release offenders

282
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,160
who've served the majority
of their sentences,

283
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,640
particularly the immunocompromised
and the elderly.

284
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,840
Those groups are at high-risk
for the virus and the elderly

285
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,200
are also
a very low-risk to reoffend.

286
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,280
You could also place certain
prisoners on furlough,

287
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,560
pausing their sentence and
having them return to finish it

288
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,520
once the pandemic is under control.

289
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,720
Or, you can place them
under house arrest.

290
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,280
At the national level, to his, and
I cannot believe I say this, credit,

291
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,040
Attorney General Barr released
a DOJ memo instructing federal prisons

292
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,760
to reduce their populations.

293
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,640
Which sounds like a great idea,
in theory.

294
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,040
But, to date, they've only done that
by around 3 percent.

295
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,920
Which is even worse
than the typical state prison,

296
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,280
because they've reduced
their population by just 5 percent.

297
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,160
And that's simply not enough.

298
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,680
I know this might put you
in the uncomfortable situation

299
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,240
of having to argue on behalf of people
that you might not find sympathetic.

300
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,440
Take the case of one federal prisoner
who pushed hard to be released.

301
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,800
A judge rejected  pharmaceutical
executive Martin Shkreli's request

302
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,320
to be let out of prison to research
a coronavirus treatment.

303
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,640
The presiding judge noted that
probation officials viewed that claim

304
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,400
as the type of: "delusional behavior
that led to his conviction."

305
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,800
Martin Shkreli, the "Pharma Bro" who
tried to get released to home arrest

306
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,440
so that he could "work on developing
a cure for the coronavirus."

307
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,200
Presumably, so he could
call it "Rona Juice" and then sell it

308
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,400
for 5 000 percent more
than it should cost.

309
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,520
He was denied. When you hear that,
you might think: "Good. Fuck that guy."

310
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,640
Generally, yeah, fuck that guy.
But in this instance,

311
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,600
despite the fact that Martin Shkreli
is an attention starved tree frog

312
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,600
who clearly wasn't held enough
as a tadpole

313
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,080
and despite his reasoning for why
he should be released being bullshit,

314
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,040
I don't want him to contract
the virus and potentially die from it.

315
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,080
I don't want that for anyone.
None of us should.

316
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,640
Yet right now, millions of Americans
are currently stuck

317
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,600
in truly desperate straits and vastly
disproportionately, people of color.

318
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,280
Some prisoners
have become so desperate,

319
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,080
they will risk punishment to try
and get anyone in the outside world

320
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,240
to pay attention to their situation.

321
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,600
Watch this prisoner openly using
a contraband cell phone,

322
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,120
which he knows will lead
to consequences to raise an alarm.

323
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,960
This motherfucker dying from corona.
They got him in my room.

324
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,440
They're literally leaving us
in here to die.

325
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,320
This is Aaron Campbell.
He's an inmate at FCI Elkton,

326
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,720
a lowsecurity federal prison
in Ohio.

327
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,120
He's using a contraband cell phone,

328
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,200
and he knows he's gonna get
in trouble for making this video.

329
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,440
I was like, fuck it, try to keep this,
the phone situation low key.

330
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,920
But this shit's serious as fuck.
Everybody in this bitch is dying,

331
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,640
and, what the fuck y'all want me to do,
die in this bitch ?

332
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,640
No. I absolutely do not want that.
I have to tell you:

333
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,480
the authorities at that prison have
said that the men in that video

334
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,360
were completely fine
and neither were sick.

335
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,200
Although you should also know that
by the government's own count,

336
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,720
at that one low-security institution,
more than 600 inmates

337
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,920
have tested positive for coronavirus
and nine have died.

338
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,240
If you're wondering
how that prisoner is doing,

339
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,680
he's reportedly been in solitary since
that video went viral in early April.

340
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,320
He wrote a letter to reporters
saying that officials told him

341
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,240
he wouldn't face additional discipline

342
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,240
if he issued a statement
saying the video was fake.

343
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,040
A request he then refused,
which is incredibly brave.

344
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,280
That's coming from me, a man who
has never missed an opportunity to say:

345
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,440
"I'm sorry"
for literally anything.

346
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,560
At this point, it's worth asking:
what the fuck are we doing here ?

347
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,160
Particularly during this pandemic,
but also in general.

348
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,200
There's a much larger discussion
to be had about

349
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,120
how millions of people ended up
incarcerated in the first place

350
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,600
and whether or not prisons even work
which I would argue they do,

351
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,920
if your only goal is to have
a lot of people in prison.

352
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,920
We should be depopulating
prisons and jails as quickly as we can.

353
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,080
I know how that sounds
because we were all raised

354
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,640
hearing that you shouldn't do
the crime if you can't do the time.

355
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,520
But in our current system, you're
never just being sentenced to time.

356
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,520
You're being sentenced
to a lifetime of social stigma,

357
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,560
futile job interviews, and roadblocks
to necessities like housing.

358
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,880
All of that is immoral enough,
there is, frankly, no reason

359
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,880
we should now also be sentencing
people to die from a virus.

360
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,920
That's not justice. It's neglect.
And it really matters.

361
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,520
As much as we'd like to pretend
that incarcerated people

362
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,080
are a "separate population",
they're not.

363
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,920
Whatever they've done, they are
still members of our society.

364
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,360
And if this horrific year
has taught us one thing,

365
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,920
it's that we are all on this death
cruise ship together.

366
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,800
And now this.

367
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,880
A Father's Day Tribute
to the World's Greatest Dad.

368
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,160
I figured
with Father's Day coming up,

369
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,000
we have an opportunity to sit with
the most powerful father in the world.

370
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,040
Over the years I've told you things
I didn't like about you

371
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,280
and things
that I didn't like about you.

372
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,240
I've told you things that you had
to straighten out. I was very strong.

373
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,800
I don't want to make that
a big public thing.

374
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,480
We're
talking about the business side.

375
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,040
My father always reminds us
that it's him and then everyone else.

376
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,120
I don't even want to bother him.

377
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,920
I feel it's almost trite to call him
and just to say hello.

378
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,520
What's the favorite thing you have
in common with your father ?

379
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,680
Either real estate or golf.

380
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,800
Donald, with your daughter ?

381
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,920
I was going to say sex
but I can't relate that to her.

382
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,360
What does Tiffany have of yours
and what of Marla's ?

383
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,480
I think
that she's got a lot of Marla.

384
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,760
She's a really beautiful baby and
she's got Marla's legs.

385
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,280
We don't know whether or
not she's got this part yet.

386
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,120
I'm not gonna be doing the diapers.
I'm not gonna be making the food.

387
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,520
I may never even see the kids.

388
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,840
The one thing I would say for both
of you is you have to keep focused.

389
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,440
You're not always focused,

390
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,920
but a lot of that has to do
with the fact that you're very young.

391
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,120
- Very good, thank you.
- Thank you.

392
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,680
You could stay behind and ask
the questions without me here,

393
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,000
that's something
a lot of the big anchors do.

394
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,040
They'll say:
"Thank you very much"

395
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,200
and then they'll sit in the chair and
they'll re-ask a couple of questions.

396
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,680
Moving on.
Before we go tonight,

397
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,640
we just wanted to say
a quick word about social media.

398
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,560
The service that forces
the question:

399
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,680
"Is this celebrity trending for being
too horny, too racist, or too dead ?"

400
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,920
Sometimes it's two out of three,
but which two might surprise you.

401
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,800
Heathcliff the Cat died refreshingly
not racist but incredibly horny.

402
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,240
Specifically, I'd like to talk
to you about fancams.

403
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,080
And if you are unfamiliar
with what they are,

404
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,760
don't feel bad,
some of my best friends are old.

405
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,560
Basically, fancams are short
montages of a performer that you like,

406
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,680
set to music.

407
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,680
Anyone can be fancammed
and I do mean anyone.

408
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,680
Here is a real one that we found.

409
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,320
Don't know what the right number of
likes for a video of my body is

410
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,160
but I do know that one
feels a little high.

411
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,320
Fancams have been
a source of fun online.

412
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,160
Lately, a particular subset
of social media users

413
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,200
have deployed them for real good.

414
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,320
Across the globe, fans of Korean
pop music, also known as Kpop,

415
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,280
are known for their fierce
loyalty and devotion.

416
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,920
Now they're setting
their sights on racial equality,

417
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,480
bombarding
the hashtag #WhiteLivesMatter,

418
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,280
a social media hashtag with ties
to white supremacy,

419
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,800
with a sea of K-pop music,

420
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,040
memes, and messages
like "#ProtectTheProtesters".

421
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,600
They do it by posting so fast
and feverishly

422
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,800
that they drown out everything else.

423
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,040
That's incredible.
And I have to say:

424
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,920
it is genuinely refreshing to see
racists getting drowned out in America

425
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,960
instead of our policy of letting them
co-star in family Christmas comedies.

426
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,760
Fancams featuring K-pop stars
in particular have repeatedly

427
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,400
managed to drown out
racist hashtags.

428
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,800
I love the idea of someone
searching "white lives matter"

429
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,800
for some racist content and,
instead, finding only stuff like this.

430
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,120
I know I'm stating
the obvious here, but:

431
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,160
Jungkook can just
objectively get it.

432
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,680
And it's frankly shame-inducing
that Kpop has produced him

433
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,000
while American pop fans
are stuck with Adam Levine,

434
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,560
a man who looks like the world's
saddest adult coloring book.

435
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,360
K-pop fans aren't just
trolling racists,

436
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,920
they may be managing
to have real world impact.

437
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,800
Not only are they
claiming responsibility

438
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,920
for many of the no-show ticket requests
at last night's Trump rally,

439
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,280
there's also this.

440
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,680
Police in Dallas are having a hard
time trying to crack down on vandals

441
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,200
because of music fans.

442
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,800
The department tweeted out an app
for reporting people involved

443
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,080
but someone asked people
to submit random other videos

444
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,440
to protect the protestors.

445
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,120
K-pop fans responded with so many
videos from concerts,

446
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,280
they say
the app stopped working.

447
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,480
Dallas Police said the app is down
because of technical difficulties.

448
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,480
"Technical difficulties."
That's an interesting way to say

449
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,480
"Our app watched a thousand videos
of BTS and died of horniness",

450
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,040
but I guess that some programs don't
have an error code for that yet.

451
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,920
But that kind of signal-jamming is not
just limited to the K-pop fandom.

452
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,600
White supremacist hashtags have
also been bombarded

453
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,840
with videos like this gif of Mario
and Sonic the Hedgehog

454
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,280
finally giving
into their carnal desires.

455
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,720
It was only a matter of time.
I, for one, am happy for them.

456
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,400
Even certain members
of the furry community

457
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,560
joined in the fight,
posting things like:

458
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,920
"Hashtag #WhiteLivesMatter racists"

459
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,400
"look at my fursona's knotted
otter cock, thanks, smiley face."

460
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,280
Which is excellent.

461
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,800
Thanks to many contributions
like what you've seen so far,

462
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,680
the #WhiteLivesMatter
and #WhiteOutWednesday protests

463
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,840
became virtually non-functional.

464
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,160
We should thank everyone involved
for undermining them.

465
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,200
I kind of want to get in on this
magnificent mission

466
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,240
but I don't want to disrupt
what everyone else is doing.

467
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,880
If you happen to be a fan of K-pop,
erotic animal art and this show,

468
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,280
and you want to drown out
racist hashtags,

469
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,040
a video that combines all of those
elements might be useful to you.

470
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,440
I've got good news because
we're in a unique position

471
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,640
to provide you
with a video like that.

472
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,080
And here it is.

473
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:09,480
Yes ! That video is now available
on our Twitter, Facebook

474
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,800
and Instagram feeds.

475
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,600
And you can download it from
the website RatEroticaFanCam.com,

476
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,480
which was surprisingly available !

477
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,240
Take it for whatever you need,

478
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
whether you're looking to flood
a racist hashtag

479
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,240
or just as a much-needed
pick-me-up every once in a while.

480
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,040
The point is, it is there for you.
That's our show.

481
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,280
Thanks for watching. We'll see you
next week, good night !

482
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,760
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

483
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,920
END OF EPISODE 16,
SEASON VII
