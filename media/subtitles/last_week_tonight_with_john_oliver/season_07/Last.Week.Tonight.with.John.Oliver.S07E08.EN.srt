LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,500
SEASON VII
EPISODE 8

3
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,180
Hello there !
Welcome, once again, to our show,

4
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,940
still taking place
inside this white void.

5
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,900
I've been calling it a white void.

6
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,980
But it's this zoomed-in picture
of Snoopy's dick.

7
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,580
For 3 weeks now, you've been
staring at a cartoon dog's dong.

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,700
Sorry for not telling you sooner.
I'm telling you now !

9
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,460
It's clearly been a very busy week.

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,260
Bernie Sanders
dropped out of the presidential race.

11
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,340
Boris Johnson dropped in,
then out, of intensive care.

12
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,060
And the coronavirus continued
to cause widespread havoc,

13
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,500
including forcing some of us to deal
with the difficulty of working at home,

14
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,940
as this news reporter learned when his
cat pulled focus during a live shot.

15
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,460
Another Valley business
is making changes

16
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,380
to ensure the customer
and worker safety.

17
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,300
Starting today,
a White House fruit farm in Canfield

18
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,940
is temporarily closing to walk
in traffic due to the pandemic.

19
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,900
I was not paying attention
to a single word that man just said.

20
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,340
Probably because he broke the
cardinal rule of broadcast journalism:

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,820
never report the news
while sitting next to a cat

22
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,900
who's making a five course
meal out of its own asshole.

23
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,020
I hope the story that he was
trying to break there was about

24
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,980
how his cat's butthole
is clean as a whistle,

25
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,860
because that's all the information
I got from that.

26
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,140
That clip actually points to our
main story, though, tonight,

27
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,060
which is how the coronavirus
has impacted workers.

28
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,780
Not so much those who are lucky
enough-like that man, and that cat,

29
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,380
and our staff
to be able to work from home.

30
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,020
It is something only around 1/3 of
people are able to do in this country.

31
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,740
Instead, I'd like to talk
about two groups:

32
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,980
the unemployed and those
having to leave the house

33
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,180
because they work "essential jobs".

34
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,180
Because each is facing
a different set of challenges.

35
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,300
And let's start
with the unemployed.

36
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,940
More than one in 10 workers have lost
their jobs in the past three weeks.

37
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,140
Those are staggering numbers.

38
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,500
And the federal government
has taken some big steps

39
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,420
to protect those people
and to try and slow down job loss.

40
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,860
Unfortunately, the execution
has been less than ideal.

41
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,100
Take the Paycheck Protection Program,

42
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,620
which offers loans of up to $10 million
to small businesses,

43
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,780
loans which don't have to be repaid if
they keep their workers on the payroll.

44
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,180
To hear Trump tell it,
the rollout has been pretty great.

45
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,300
It's really a tribute to government,
really well-run government.

46
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,940
And there are few glitches.
Very few.

47
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,020
Any little glitch, we had worked
out within minutes, within hours.

48
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,540
I just want to congratulate everybody.
This has become so popular.

49
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,660
That is just classic Trump,
to try and brag

50
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,340
about how in-demand
an emergency bailout system is.

51
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,860
If he was captain of the Titanic,
you just know he'd be saying,

52
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,300
"I just want to congratulate everyone.
These lifeboats have become popular !

53
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,340
A few weeks ago-nothing,
now they're moving like hotcakes.

54
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,820
It's really a tribute
to a well-run ship.

55
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,940
And I know this won't shock you,
but the situation

56
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,020
the president just said was going great
and makes him look good,

57
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,580
isn't and doesn't.

58
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,580
The glitches he just tried to brush off
were pretty substantial.

59
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,020
On the day the program
was supposed to launch,

60
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,300
many of the nation's biggest banks
said they weren't yet ready

61
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,300
to take loan applications
because the government didn't release

62
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,340
final versions of the documents
they needed until the night before.

63
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,020
This means many banks
have been playing catch-up,

64
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,660
as this health food store
owner discovered.

65
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,580
Monday morning, I go into my branch
to talk to my, my banker.

66
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,660
He didn't know what was going on.
He wasn't even informed.

67
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,900
He couldn't even inform us to apply,
because he didn't know.

68
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,980
Is it frustrating
for you when you're hearing,

69
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,660
"No, no, no.
The SBA's gonna get involved,"

70
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,300
"and they are going to provide
a safety net" ?

71
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,340
But when ? That's the question.
That's the million-dollar question.

72
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,340
Yeah, of course it is.

73
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,500
Whether you're a small business owner
or a trapeze artist,

74
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,460
the two questions you always want
answered about your safety net are

75
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,460
"When will it be there ?"
and "How big are the holes ?"

76
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,900
And the obvious problem is,
if help takes months to come,

77
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,340
that's not going to save a business
set to go under in weeks.

78
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:36,380
To be fair, no program of this size was
ever going to have a perfect rollout.

79
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,780
But this is yet another area
where this administration

80
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,900
could've been preparing
for this much, much sooner.

81
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,140
And it definitely doesn't help

82
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,100
that the director of the National
Economic Council, Larry Kudlow,

83
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,140
downplayed complaints
like this !

84
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,380
My wife Judy, whom you know,

85
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,580
and she is a self-employed
artist/painter,

86
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,580
a very distinguished one
of some renown,

87
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,060
she could use some help
for her operation

88
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,420
and she went
to a local community bank

89
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,060
up in our place in Connecticut

90
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,980
and apparently it's a one-page form,
that's all it is.

91
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,860
So, couldn't be easier.

92
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,940
His response was basically, "My wife
did it, so what's the problem ?"

93
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,220
There are a few issues there:

94
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,460
one, Judy Kudlow is the wife of a
high-ranking White House official,

95
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,740
which might have had some impact
on her experience at the bank.

96
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,420
Two, I'm not sure the phrase,
"it couldn't be easier",

97
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,420
should apply to anyone whose situation
includes being married to Larry Kudlow.

98
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,940
And three, if your ears perked up
when you heard him say

99
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,060
his wife is an artist of some renown,
you're not alone.

100
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,540
We did look into it, so you might
want to lace up some comfy shoes,

101
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,740
'cause we're about to go
for a brief walk together

102
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,060
through Judith Kudlow's
still life work.

103
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,420
It often seems to be focused
on her husband's clothes.

104
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,620
That's a real painting
titled "Three Shirts",

105
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,380
showcasing what I can only assume
are three of Larry's shirts.

106
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,300
And that's just part of a larger
collection in her closet series,

107
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,820
featuring such pieces
as "Summer Shirt", "Grey and White",

108
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,060
"American Shirts",
and "American Shirts", 2013.

109
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,580
But, I don't want you to think
her art is merely shirt based.

110
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:23,380
She also paints her husband's ties.
Lots, and lots, and lots of his ties.

111
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,940
When you think she couldn't possibly
paint another of Larry Kudlow's ties,

112
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,060
she does it again,
and then somehow does it again,

113
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,060
and then again,
and again, and again.

114
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,740
And crucially, Larry Kudlow himself
appears to be nowhere in her work.

115
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,860
And I don't mean to make any sweeping
judgments about their marriage.

116
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,780
I'm just saying, these aren't
so much portraits of Larry Kudlow

117
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,780
as they are portraits
of the absence of Larry Kudlow.

118
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,380
They showcase the beauty
of where Larry Kudlow isn't.

119
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,500
And sure, that's a beauty
we can all appreciate !

120
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,780
I mean, it's no "Stay Up Late" by
Brian Swords of York, but what is ?

121
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,420
And on that note:
I actually have another proposition.

122
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,860
If you are the owner of a Judith Kudlow
tie painting, I want one.

123
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,980
You may remember, I offered
to pay $1,000 for "Stay Up Late",

124
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,340
which is why I'm willing
to offer $10 for one of these.

125
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,020
Although, that's not all, as this offer
also comes with a $20,000 donation

126
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,860
to the food bank in your area.

127
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,300
So, if you, or someone you know, owns
one of these Larry-less masterpieces,

128
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,340
just email John-at-JohnOliver
WantsYourRatErotica-dotcom.

129
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,820
There was no need to make up
a new email address

130
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,340
when the perfect one
was already available.

131
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,060
Anyway, what were we talking about ?
That's right-mass unemployment.

132
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,220
With the Paycheck Protection Program
experiencing a bumpy rollout

133
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,940
and thousands of businesses
laying off staff,

134
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,460
millions are now in need
of government assistance.

135
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,380
That is why Congress has significantly
expanded unemployment insurance

136
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,540
for the next few months-which is good.

137
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,380
Unfortunately,
the sheer magnitude of demand,

138
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,460
combined with the fact many
states' unemployment systems

139
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,300
have been neglected
and underfunded for decades,

140
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,300
means that, too often, people are
having real difficulty getting through.

141
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,020
All specialists
are busy with other customers.

142
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,100
You must call back this week.

143
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,300
I've done that 50 times,
every day, for two weeks.

144
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,700
Are you a month away from being
broke ? Two months away ?

145
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,100
I'd say about a month.

146
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,180
Yeah.

147
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,900
I'm curious, would you try
the unemployment office again ?

148
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,020
Yeah, absolutely.
Let me pull up the number.

149
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,100
We're sorry.

150
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,740
We are experiencing an extremely
high volume of calls at this time.

151
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,740
Holy shit. With those results,

152
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,340
you might as well call
(719) 266-2837.

153
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,020
It's the Callin' Oates hotline,
an actual number you can dial

154
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,460
to hear one of four possible
Hall & Oates songs in an emergency.

155
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,420
Now, sure, they can't help you
with your healthcare or finances,

156
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,940
but honestly, neither can
the Department of Labor right now

157
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,980
and at least with Callin' Oates,
you get to hear "Maneater".

158
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,180
So, once again,
that's (719) 26-OATES.

159
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,420
Claiming unemployment
is incredibly difficult right now

160
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,940
and that's not even
getting into the fact

161
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,060
that for many people
who lose their jobs,

162
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,940
they then lose
their health insurance.

163
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,940
And this is, to put it mildly, a very
bad time for that to be happening.

164
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,380
So, it's frankly no wonder many who
can work, feel that they have to,

165
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,540
even if that means enduring
a dangerous work environment.

166
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,740
And that brings us to the second group
we're gonna look at tonight:

167
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,540
essential workers.

168
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,260
It's a broad term
that can include any job

169
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,020
from health care professionals
to custodians,

170
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,460
to grocery store clerks
to, I would argue,

171
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,660
TikTok stars
teaching me how to dance.

172
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,180
Carole Baskin.

173
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,740
Killed her husband, whacked 'em.

174
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,060
Can't convince me
that it didn't happen.

175
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,020
Fed 'em to tigers, they snackin'.

176
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,180
What's happening ?
Carole Baskin.

177
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,980
Excellent !

178
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,500
In the Venn diagram of how I'm spending
my time during quarantine,

179
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,180
the absolute dead center
is the overlap of TikTok,

180
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,900
learning a brandnew skill,
and "Tiger King".

181
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,860
I'm gonna be such a good dancer/
slash-Carole-Baskin-truther !

182
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,460
Or, I should say, Carole Baskin !

183
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,460
And companies
who employ essential workers

184
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,020
have openly waxed poetic
about how much they value them,

185
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,500
few in more glowing terms
than Amazon.

186
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,900
To all of our Amazon retail heroes,
on the floor,

187
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,140
in the air, and behind the wheel,
we want to thank you !

188
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,100
We'll continue
to do everything we can

189
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,660
to keep you healthy,
safe, and protected.

190
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,740
The work you are doing
means everything right now.

191
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,420
Thank you.

192
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,580
It's hard to say
what I like least about that:

193
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,820
maybe it's the schmaltzy
piano music,

194
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,780
maybe it's Amazon
patronizingly claiming

195
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,340
they care about
the wellbeing of their "heroes",

196
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,420
or maybe it's just the fact that,
out of context,

197
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,300
the Amazon smile logo is a quick
sketch of a circumcised dick.

198
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,820
It's probably
a combination of all three.

199
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,860
And while the company claims
it's keeping workers safe

200
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,220
by distributing masks and,
and conducting temperature checks,

201
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,420
many Amazon workers
paint a much different picture,

202
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,580
citing concerns like "an inability to
maintain social distancing guidelines,

203
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,060
a lack of protective gear
and hand sanitizer

204
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,220
and lack of time
to clean their hands".

205
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,180
And if you feel you're
not working in safe conditions,

206
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,940
it can be even more infuriating
to know the items you're packing

207
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,380
can sometimes be anything
but essential.

208
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,660
They should not be selling
non-essential items.

209
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,460
If you go on the website, all the
essential items are, are sold out.

210
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,620
Until you restock and until you
close this building, shut it down.

211
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,540
Dildos are not essential items.

212
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,700
Books, for kids, yes.
But, dildos ?

213
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,340
No.

214
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,820
Right.

215
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,220
Risking your life to get someone
a sex toy probably doesn't feel fair.

216
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,140
There's a reason "1917"
wasn't about two soldiers

217
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,340
trying to bring Benedict Cumberbatch
a dildo he wanted.

218
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,580
Although yes, the cinematography
would still have been impressive.

219
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,540
The continuous shot of George MacKay
sprinting through the trenches

220
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,820
followed by Benedict Cumberbatch
masturbating with a dildo to completion

221
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,940
in Dickens' hands
it would have been a masterpiece.

222
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:26,220
And look, determining what
constitutes an essential product

223
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,260
clearly isn't straightforward.

224
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,260
If dildos make it
easier for people to stay inside,

225
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,220
you could argue
they might literally save lives.

226
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,820
But if we're depending on those
workers for both our survival

227
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,420
and, to a certain extent,
our comfort,

228
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,660
we owe them a lot in return.

229
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,220
And companies should be doing
everything they can

230
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,900
to lower the risks to workers

231
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,860
which can mean offering
protective gear,

232
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,980
changing workflow
to allow for more distance,

233
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,020
or putting up Plexiglass shields
in grocery stores.

234
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,460
And one thing every company
should be doing

235
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,340
is offering paid sick leave.

236
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:03,820
Congress actually required employers to
temporarily provide two weeks of that

237
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,500
in the Families First
Coronavirus Response Act,

238
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,220
but, unfortunately,
that requirement only applies

239
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,420
to businesses with fewer
than 500 employees.

240
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,340
The thinking
was that larger companies

241
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,540
were either already offering paid sick
leave or would do it on their own.

242
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,780
Sadly, that has not
always been the case.

243
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,580
Buzzfeed found that all these companies
currently have policies less generous

244
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,180
than the one the government
established for small businesses,

245
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,140
or have set unreasonably
high bars to qualify.

246
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,580
Amazon's initial policy was that it
would give two-weeks paid time off

247
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,940
for anyone who's diagnosed with Covid,
or who's been quarantined.

248
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,900
Which sounds good,
but there's a big problem

249
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,580
with requiring a positive test,
as one worker pointed out.

250
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,620
Good luck getting the test
in New York right now.

251
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,820
It's very hard to make appointments.

252
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,780
The time you get the test,
it's days later.

253
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,340
The time you get the results
is days later.

254
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,060
Exactly ! Testing in New York
is so scarce,

255
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,180
Amazon's plan
may as well have been:

256
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,620
you get double pay and free
healthcare for your whole family

257
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,580
if you can guess
what number Jeff Bezos is thinking.

258
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,820
That man's name is Chris Smalls
and he was fired

259
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,140
just two hours after he helped organize
an employee walkout

260
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,660
in Amazon's Staten Island facility
last week.

261
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,660
According to Amazon,
he was let go

262
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,660
for "putting the health and safety
of others at risk"

263
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,460
by violating social distancing
guidelines and an order to quarantine.

264
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,780
But, leaked notes from
an internal meeting days later,

265
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,740
at which Bezos himself
was present,

266
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,620
show the company's leadership
discussing plans to make Smalls

267
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,620
"the face of the entire
union/organizing movement"

268
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,660
since he is
"not smart, or articulate".

269
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,980
Which, holy shit !

270
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,740
That is so racist,
I can't even point out

271
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,940
how smart and articulate Smalls is
without also sounding racist.

272
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,700
Amazon will say that they've now
made their sick leave policy

273
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,860
more lenient for their "heroes",
which is true.

274
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:05,580
That only came after they got a letter
from 14 state attorneys general,

275
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,260
saying their initial policy was
inadequate to protect public health.

276
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,500
And this clearly
isn't just about Amazon.

277
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,540
Many companies have chosen
not to offer paid sick leave,

278
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,300
possibly because the U.S. is one
of the few wealthy democracies

279
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,900
that does not mandate
that they do that.

280
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,380
And that does a disservice not just
to workers, but also to customers,

281
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,020
as this McDonald's employee
will tell you.

282
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,660
I've worked at McDonald's
for over 10 years.

283
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,340
I'm that face you see that serves you
your hash browns for breakfast,

284
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,340
maybe a Quarter Pounder
for lunch

285
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,980
and even gave you a McFlurry
to top off your dinner menu.

286
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,820
So, I ask you,
if I caught the coronavirus,

287
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,180
would you want me making
your next meal ?

288
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:52,100
No, of course not ! I wouldn't want
anyone with the coronavirus serving me,

289
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,900
unless, of course,
that person was Adam Driver.

290
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,860
Because, infecting me with dessert
is very much on my running list

291
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,100
of "Things Adam Driver
Can Do to Me".

292
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,340
I'm sorry.

293
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,500
You thought I'd stop the Adam Driver
bit 'cause I'm stuck at home now ?

294
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,820
You were wrong about that.

295
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,980
Yes, I know my wife can hear me,
that's part of it.

296
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,380
Sneeze in my McFlurry,
you pensive bison.

297
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,420
Ravage my lungs,
you relentless hillock.

298
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:22,380
Congress absolutely needs
to mandate all businesses provide

299
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,540
paid sick leave in the next coronavirus
aid bill on a permanent basis,

300
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,900
as well as require
they provide significant hazard pay

301
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,500
for any worker
being asked to risk their lives.

302
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,380
Because that risk is very real.

303
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,260
Grocery store workers are
dying of this disease right now.

304
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,020
And so far, we've lost 41 transit
workers in New York City alone.

305
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,460
This is the least
of what essential workers

306
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,780
and, indeed, all workers,
need right now.

307
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,940
They need protection, financially,
physically and otherwise.

308
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,860
Because there are some truly
indefensible situations

309
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,300
being thrown into plain view.

310
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,860
Take this EMT in New York State,

311
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,380
who is doing incredible,
dangerous work,

312
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,300
without something
you might assume he has.

313
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:10,140
Right now, I'm doing all of this
with no health insurance.

314
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,580
How is that possible ?
It doesn't come through the job.

315
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,740
The job doesn't offer it.

316
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:21,380
And our affordable marketplaces
aren't very affordable.

317
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:26,140
If I get sick and, okay,
I go get tested positive,

318
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,700
I can't go to the hospital.

319
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,740
People come out, and they
show us their support. And I love it.

320
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,940
I have eaten so much pizza in the last
two weeks. It's been great.

321
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,500
I don't need pizza.
I need to be able to pay my bills.

322
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,380
I need to be able to work
a 40-hour workweek,

323
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,180
and live
like a normal human being.

324
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,900
Yeah, it's like that old saying
about pizza and sex:

325
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,380
even when they're bad,
they're still pretty good

326
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,860
and even when they're really good,
you still need fucking healthcare.

327
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,820
And obviously, his work
should give him health insurance.

328
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,340
But more broadly,
we need to seriously think

329
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,900
about whether having our health
insurance system so tied to employment

330
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,980
is a good idea.

331
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,540
I would argue
it emphatically isn't.

332
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,460
While many of the problems we're being
forced to confront right now

333
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,860
weren't created
by the coronavirus,

334
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,020
it has thrown a spotlight
on some of the biggest flaws

335
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,500
in how our system operates.

336
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,740
Things like paid sick leave and
hazard pay are essentially Band-Aids

337
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,780
and we absolutely need them
right now because we're bleeding.

338
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,820
But, when this is over, this country's
gonna need more than Band-Aids.

339
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,860
It's gonna need
fucking surgery.

340
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,740
Things need to change
and not go "back to normal".

341
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:44,540
Control-Z'ing us back to how we were
in 2016 is simply not gonna cut it.

342
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,700
And honestly, it shouldn't have taken
a pandemic to prove

343
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,900
our unemployment system is a mess,
that we need universal healthcare

344
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,460
and that workers need benefits,
the right to organize

345
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,300
and wages that reflect
how essential they really are.

346
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,020
We also shouldn't have needed
a pandemic to consider

347
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,420
whether mass incarceration
is tolerable,

348
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:06,060
as prisons and jails become
petri dishes for the coronavirus

349
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,660
or whether our treatment
of the homeless is adequate,

350
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,540
when we've seen photos of them
sleeping in a parking lot 6 feet apart.

351
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,780
Or, what we do about the multiple
underlying inequalities

352
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,140
that are making this virus,
in some places,

353
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,660
twice as deadly for black and
Latino people as whites.

354
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,140
What's been infuriating
is that some conservatives

355
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,140
have seemed worried
that we might do too much.

356
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,900
The extension of paid
sick leave opens the door.

357
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,380
You know what's gonna happen
on the Democratic side,

358
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
Schumer's gonna want
a permanent program.

359
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,820
They're gonna try to get another social
program. We can't let that happen.

360
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:45,060
Really ? Why the fuck not ?
That argument basically boils down to:

361
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,220
"If we help people today,"

362
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,700
"the Democrats are just gonna want
to help more people tomorrow",

363
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,300
like that's a bad thing.

364
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,540
While dollar-store Bill Nye here has
moderated his stance since then,

365
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,660
others are still adamant that nothing
should change because of this.

366
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,300
Florida Senator Rick Scott,
seen here having just learned

367
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,700
that enough money was raised
at the talent show

368
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,740
and he won't be able to shut down
the orphanage after all,

369
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,620
he put out a statement
arguing that:

370
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,020
"The crisis shouldn't be an opportunity
for members of Congress"

371
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,420
"to permanently expand
the welfare state".

372
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,660
Which is weird, because
there is no better argument

373
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,820
for a permanent welfare state
than watching your government

374
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,980
desperately try to build one
when it's already too late.

375
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,940
Because make no mistake:
the real test here

376
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,540
isn't whether or not our country
will get through this.

377
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,900
It will. The question
is how we get through this

378
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,300
and what kind of country we want
to be on the other side.

379
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,420
And if nothing else,
this crisis has done

380
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,140
what any great
Judith Kudlow painting does:

381
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,060
make painfully clear what we've been
missing all along.

382
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,020
And now this.

383
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:57,300
In Honor of Easter,
Our Annual Fuck You to Peeps.

384
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,780
As you know, Jay,
Easter's coming up on Sunday

385
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,940
and it will probably feel
a lot different this year.

386
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,500
At least there's Peeps.

387
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,100
No !
The Peeps have returned !

388
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,620
- Everyone makes fun of Peeps.
- They're nasty. Do you like 'em ?

389
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,100
Someone must buy 'em.

390
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,780
Who ? Who among you
has made this wretched bargain ?

391
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,340
It's not Easter without Peeps.

392
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,540
Fine !
Then let's not have Easter !

393
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,380
And so the other secret with Peeps
is that the kids love eating 'em

394
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,020
but what my brothers would do
is they would actually leave 'em out

395
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:36,660
and they would harden and then
they would throw 'em at me.

396
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,060
Yes !

397
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,340
This man's story of childhood trauma
is an allegory for the way

398
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,260
in which Peeps
have emotionally damaged us all !

399
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,740
Have you heard ?
The company that makes Peeps

400
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,580
is shutting down production
weeks before Easter.

401
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,380
Salvation !

402
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,820
Might we be spared the unspeakable
horror of the Peeps ?

403
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,740
But don't go into Peep panic.

404
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,340
Peeps for this year's Easter
are already hatched, you might say.

405
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:06,460
It's too late !
The Peeps have already hatched !

406
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,780
Moving on.
Finally, before we go tonight,

407
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,260
we thought we'd just take a moment
to focus on some good news.

408
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,980
Things are obviously
pretty grim right now

409
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,340
and many outlets are understandably
trying to bring you

410
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,020
any dose of joy they can find.

411
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,900
For weeks now, the news
has been full of stories like these.

412
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,740
The Georgia Aquarium teamed up
with the Atlanta Humane Society

413
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,820
so that the kitties
could go check out the fishes.

414
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,500
And you can see the kittens were
mesmerized by all the fish here.

415
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,340
Chicago's Shedd Aquarium has been
taking the penguins on a field trip

416
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,220
to visit some
of the other animals.

417
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,900
That's Wellington the penguin
saying hi to the beluga whales.

418
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:52,420
Odie and Caramel got to explore
the aquarium by themselves

419
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,580
and when they were done,
the two snuggled up for a nap.

420
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,700
That's a much-needed smile
that we can all use right now.

421
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,220
Sure ! I guess so.
Although I will say

422
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,540
not every instance of putting animals
where they don't belong has worked out.

423
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,220
One zoo seemingly tried
to replicate "The Lion King"

424
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,900
by bringing a warthog
to visit some meerkats,

425
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,220
who seemed understandably
freaked the fuck out.

426
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,380
Then there was this visit to an
aquarium by an indifferent porcupine.

427
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,500
That porcupine could not give less
of a shit about those penguins.

428
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,860
And, on behalf of bird-like
things who like to look fancy,

429
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,340
fuck you porcupine !

430
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,700
You think you're better
than penguins ? You ain't shit.

431
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,020
Your whole thing
is being pointy.

432
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,260
I liked that better the first time
when it was called being a cactus,

433
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,380
you dopey fuck.

434
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,020
Penguins waddle and they swim
and they make fun noises.

435
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,500
You should be bowing down,
you pointy mess.

436
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,340
Hashtag #TeamPenguin, hashtag
#GivePorcupinesTheCoronavirus.

437
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,860
All around the world,
there's been an inclination

438
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,820
to try and find small moments
of solidarity.

439
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,380
In the U.K., the Queen gave
a speech to unite the nation,

440
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,900
which she did, although not perhaps
in the way she intended.

441
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,260
Because in delivering that speech,
she wore a green dress,

442
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,940
which is a huge mistake,

443
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,580
as it enabled people to Photoshop
other images onto it,

444
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,380
which they very much did.

445
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,620
They also rendered her
as a "Star Trek" crew member,

446
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,780
as Iron Man,
as an Iron Maiden fan,

447
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,420
and someone who wants you
to eat farts.

448
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,660
She even served as a vehicle

449
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,580
for the climactic scene
from "Avengers: Endgame".

450
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:39,820
We join with all nations across
the globe in a common endeavor,

451
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,340
using the great advances of science

452
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,860
and our instinctive compassion
to heal.

453
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,500
Assemble.

454
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,100
That really took her speech
up a notch.

455
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,100
And I've got to say,
it was inspirational

456
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,580
to watch people collectively engage
in stupidity in the face of adversity.

457
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,340
It was a triumph
of the human spirit, in a way.

458
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,340
Which actually brings me

459
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,540
to a bit of good news
that we may have for you.

460
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,100
Because two weeks ago,
I showed you a video

461
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:12,260
of a 1992 public television art auction
from South Central Pennsylvania,

462
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,220
featuring some
truly spectacular artwork.

463
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,540
Item number 735 is a watercolor,

464
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,740
"Stay Up Late"
by Brian Swords of York.

465
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,460
It's 24 by 18 inches.

466
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,100
Brian's work began,
the Biohazard series began,

467
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:31,260
as a statement about brutality
to experimental animals

468
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,420
and has developed into a whole scene
of these rather unusual rats

469
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,860
involved in all types
of normal human activities.

470
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:42,580
Magnificent. You can't put
a price on a masterpiece like that.

471
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,820
I mean, somebody did,
and it was $80. But you get my point.

472
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,380
Now, I ended that segment offering
the owner of that painting

473
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:54,300
$1 000 plus $20 000
to the food bank of their choice.

474
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:58,740
We received, and this is true,
890 emails in response.

475
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,660
Most of which, I'll be honest,
were a complete waste of our time.

476
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,300
But some of which weren't.

477
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,820
Many who didn't have the painting

478
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,620
instead offered us
other homemade rat erotica,

479
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,180
like this magnificent painting
of two rats watching our show.

480
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,140
This other image of two rats
very much not watching our show,

481
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:21,700
this image of a five-rat orgy,
this image of me as a hot rat,

482
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,420
and even this image,
which is not of two rats,

483
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,020
but of two koalas somehow giving
each other chlamydia

484
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,740
with a bag bearing the logo of the
John Oliver Koala Chlamydia Ward.

485
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,940
All of which is very good.
But not what I needed.

486
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,340
We did, however, get one
intriguing message which read simply:

487
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,380
"I believe I have something
you're looking for",

488
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:47,060
with a photo of the painting alongside
a copy of that day's newspaper.

489
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,220
That got my hopes up that something
incredible might be about to happen.

490
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,940
And look, is this what America
needs most right now ?

491
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,980
No, of course it isn't.

492
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,660
America needs a vaccine,
more ventilators,

493
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,100
a different president, and also,
just like a quick break.

494
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,700
But you know what would be nice
in the meantime ?

495
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,260
A victory.

496
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,980
Managing to track down that painting
would definitely be a win.

497
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:18,580
Because what are the chances that,
in 1992 in South Central Pennsylvania,

498
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:24,260
a man would have made an impulse
purchase of high-quality rat erotica.

499
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:29,500
Then, instead of throwing it away
at any point in the past 28 years,

500
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,740
kept it, cherished it,
framed it,

501
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,940
not knowing that one day,
far in the future,

502
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:40,540
it might force HBO to donate
$20 000 to Pennsylvania food banks

503
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,060
in the middle of a pandemic ?

504
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,020
It sounds impossible.
There's no chance, right ?

505
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,700
But if that person could do all that

506
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,660
so that painting
could find its way to me,

507
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,420
then there's no limit to what
we can do, my friends.

508
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,780
To what
we have already done !

509
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,820
I believe I have something
you're looking for, world.

510
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,780
I believe I have something
we've all been looking for !

511
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,220
And it's called hope !

512
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,980
That is our show.
Thank you so much for watching !

513
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,340
We'll see you next week.
Good night.

514
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,340
We did it !

515
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,420
I hope in the years to come,

516
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,260
everyone will be able to take pride in
how they responded to this challenge.

517
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,300
And those who come after us

518
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,940
will say the Britons of this generation
were as strong as any.

519
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:44,940
That the attributes of selfdiscipline,
acquired good humored resolve

520
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:49,260
and a fellow feeling
still characterize this country.

521
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,380
LAST WEEK TONIGHT

522
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,460
