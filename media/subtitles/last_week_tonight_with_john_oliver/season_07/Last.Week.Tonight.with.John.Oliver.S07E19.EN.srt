1
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,320
Hi, there.
Welcome to the show,

2
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,360
still coming to you
from this blank void.

3
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,000
Before you ask, yes.
We have made some changes.

4
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:37,360
The desk is glass now, and that's it.
That's the full extent of the upgrades.

5
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,640
It's been a busy week, from baseball
returning in front of cardboard fans

6
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,480
to Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez shredding
Ted Yoho on the floor of the House,

7
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,160
to Trump bragging about passing
a basic cognitive test.

8
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,480
Which I will say, in terms of brags,
is at least better than

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,120
"I've met Ghislaine Maxwell multiple
times and I wish her well."

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,040
Let's start tonight with what's
been happening in Portland,

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,720
the Nature Valley granola bar
of U.S. cities

12
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,280
in that it's crunchy, messy, and,
let's be honest, nobody's first choice.

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,520
The news this week
has been dominated

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,040
by shocking images
from Portland like these.

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,320
The U.S. attorney in Oregon wants
an investigation in Portland

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,360
after videos surfaced showing
unidentified camouflaged agents

17
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,440
arresting protesters and putting
them into unmarked cars.

18
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,120
And this disturbing video shows
the agents beating a Navy veteran

19
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,560
with batons and then dousing him
with pepper spray

20
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,920
when he says that he was trying
to engage them in a civil conversation.

21
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,480
That is intense. And it frankly says
so much about this country right now

22
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,400
that CNN will show federal agents
treat a human being like a pinata,

23
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,040
yet censor that same man
for rightfully telling those agents

24
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,760
to fuck the fuck off.

25
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,120
We're witnessing the rapid decline
of American civil liberties,

26
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,840
let's try not to be
fucking prudes about it.

27
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,960
The protests in Portland have been
going on daily for nearly two months,

28
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,280
since the killing of George Floyd,
but the deployment of federal agents

29
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,440
was a sharp escalation
of questionable legality.

30
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,200
And yet,
to hear the president tell it,

31
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,640
he had no choice
and it was a terrific idea.

32
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,080
We're doing a great job in Portland.
Portland was very rough

33
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,200
and they called us in and we did
a good job, to put it mildly.

34
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,640
Many people in jail right now.

35
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,200
First: it's never good when Trump
says he's doing a "great job",

36
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,840
given that he thinks his administration

37
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,320
is doing a "great job"
dealing with coronavirus,

38
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,080
and he once proclaimed Ben Affleck
would do a "great job" as Batman.

39
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,120
Clearly, this man has no sense of
what a great job actually looks like.

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,720
And for the record, those agents
were very much not called in.

41
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,360
Oregon's governor announced
she didn't want them there

42
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,520
and "the federal government should
remove them from our streets"

43
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,600
and Portland's mayor, Ted Wheeler,
said pretty much the same.

44
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,520
What they're doing is they are
sharply escalating the situation.

45
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,000
They're not wanted here.
We haven't asked them here.

46
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,920
In fact, we want them to leave.

47
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,720
Yeah, masked individuals throwing
people into an unmarked van

48
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,440
is never a good idea if you want
to de-escalate a situation.

49
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,960
It's not even a good idea
for a surprise bachelorette party.

50
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,600
Ya got me ! I thought I was being
kidnapped there for a second.

51
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,640
My life flashed before my eyes
and I think I may have shit myself,

52
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,480
but you girls are the best,
bring on the strippers !

53
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,000
And the reason federal agents
were not called in

54
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,400
might be that things weren't
especially dire in Portland.

55
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,920
Protests have been
mostly peaceful there.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,520
Which is not to say that there haven't
been isolated, chaotic incidents.

57
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,240
Those situations have not
been helped by the fact

58
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,960
that the local police force, under
the leadership of Ted Wheeler,

59
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,200
have routinely overreacted,
using things like tear gas

60
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,160
to the point where Wheeler
became known as "Tear Gas Teddy".

61
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,600
Which, I guarantee you,

62
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,400
is set to be this Christmas's
worst-selling toy.

63
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,720
They have justified dangerous
crowd-control tactics

64
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,400
by releasing photos like this,
claiming they'd been attacked

65
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,960
with, among other things,
a can of White Claw

66
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,080
and a half-eaten apple, which is less
a threatening display of weaponry

67
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,920
and more of a summoning circle
for ghosts who died at Burning Man.

68
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,080
And for all the talk by Trump
and administration officials

69
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,600
of the need to restore order
in Portland,

70
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,320
those on the ground will tell you it's
not entirely what's being portrayed.

71
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,840
We've noticed that the volume
that is being described by DHS

72
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,400
and including administration officials
doesn't seem to square

73
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,840
with what's going on here.

74
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,120
You do have rioters,

75
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,400
you do have people that are
trying to deface this building

76
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,280
but it's not as though
this is overwhelming chaos.

77
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,400
We're talking about one city block
that's the epicenter here.

78
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,560
Exactly. It's about one block
that was actually starting to see

79
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,120
fewer confrontations
between protestors and police

80
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,480
before federal agents moved in.

81
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,920
Or, if you watch Fox News,
it's the end of America as we know it.

82
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,040
For more than six weeks now,

83
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,480
Portland has been under siege
by radical leftist mobs

84
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,520
who are intent on destroying
everything America stands for.

85
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,880
Portland has now experienced
50 straight days of left-wing violence.

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,120
We are watching a war
on the streets of Portland.

87
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,960
Three federal courthouses have now
been damaged on multiple occasions.

88
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,800
The Hatfield Courthouse
was firebombed.

89
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,160
The U.S. Custom House was vandalized.
Police were attacked with lasers.

90
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,360
Several officers now assaulted
with sledgehammers.

91
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,680
Stores were broken into, buildings
were set on fire. This is insane.

92
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,080
Yeah, it is insane.

93
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,520
Because that tone does not honestly
reflect the conditions on the ground.

94
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,160
That firebombing, for instance,
seems to be a reference

95
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,240
to either a firework
or a small fire that was set,

96
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,800
which is significantly less dramatic
than he is trying to make it sound.

97
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,120
That rolling list next to Hannity's
head is mostly graffiti.

98
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,200
In fact, "graffiti" is listed 12 times
in a row there under the headline

99
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,800
"Violence in Portland",
which is a huge overstatement.

100
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,200
And at that point, it would
have been just as accurate

101
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,520
if that heading had said
"Cannibalism in Portland"

102
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,600
or "Texas Chainsaw Massacres
in Portland" or "9/11s in Portland".

103
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,000
The troubling thing here
is Portland seems to be being used

104
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,520
as a staging ground by the president to
put on an authoritarian show of force.

105
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,480
And this could end very badly,
especially as he's now apparently

106
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,640
threatened to use federal force
in other cities as well,

107
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,920
which is absolutely outrageous.

108
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,440
And if you, like Trump, think
that it is fine to use federal troops

109
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,560
as a prop to crush the constitutional
right to assemble, then,

110
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,400
like a great American, I would like
to offer you a basic cognitive test,

111
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,560
which is: how many fingers
am I holding up ?

112
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,240
And now this.

113
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,360
Martha Stewart Loosens Up
During The Lockdown.

114
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,960
I have three people staying with me
during this time.

115
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,560
I've basically locked them
in my house.

116
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,720
And the card games get really
lively after dinner number 53 tonight.

117
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,280
I forgot to get vanilla,

118
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,960
so I'm gonna use my favorite
other flavoring, which is brandy.

119
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,040
Tequila blanco.
And then, frozen vodka.

120
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,480
Just enough to give you
a little buzz.

121
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,480
I just keep a saucer of salt handy

122
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,200
whenever I want to have a margarita
or a Martha-rita.

123
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,280
I'm using my favorite rolling pin,
which I got in Paris on my honeymoon.

124
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,680
Only good thing about
my honeymoon was this rolling pin.

125
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,320
Wine, gin, wine, gin,

126
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,080
gin, gin, gin, gin.

127
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,200
And the rest of the beer,
guess what ?

128
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,320
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns eyelashes,

129
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,400
among other things, the reasons
that camels are so sexy.

130
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,880
Without those luscious lashes,

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,440
they'd just be lumpy horses
with furry back boobs.

132
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,080
But then you see those eyes
and you remember:

133
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,040
"Yeah. I'd totally fuck a camel."

134
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,520
And by the way, I'm serious.
We're gonna talk about eyelashes.

135
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,120
It's the summer, there's a pandemic
raging, and frankly,

136
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,520
we've all earned a deep dive on how
best to make your eyelashes pop.

137
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,560
There's a TikTok makeup tutorial
that I'd like you to take a look at.

138
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,040
Hi guys, I'm gonna teach you
guys how to get long lashes.

139
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,600
So, you need to do is grab your lash
curler, curl your lashes.

140
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,520
Then you're gonna put them down
and use your phone to search up

141
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,600
what's happening in China, how
they're getting concentration camps,

142
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,040
throwing innocent Muslims in there,
separating their families.

143
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,240
Hold on !
That took quite a turn there.

144
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,240
She went from promising longer lashes
to discussing concentration camps

145
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,200
in just 12 seconds
and that's genuinely impressive.

146
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,960
I'm a bit of an expert at taking
something fun and quickly ruining it,

147
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,400
so this is game
recognizing game here.

148
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,000
But she is right,

149
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,320
a lash curler is a vital tool
in anyone's beauty arsenal

150
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,640
and there's an ethnic group in China
being systematically surveilled

151
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,920
and imprisoned in an attempt
to wipe their culture off the map.

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,200
And you know what ?

153
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,120
Let's hold the eyelash story
for another week and instead,

154
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,720
let's talk about this.

155
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,320
Because the people
in question are the Uighurs.

156
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,600
They're a mostly Muslim ethnic minority
in a region of China called Xinjiang

157
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,600
and the Chinese government has
been treating them absolutely terribly.

158
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,400
A U.N. panel says the region resembles
a massive internment camp,

159
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,640
where more than
one million Muslim minorities

160
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,080
have been rounded up, detained

161
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,960
and forcibly indoctrinated
by the Chinese regime.

162
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,160
Witness accounts, satellite imagery
and Communist Party documents

163
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,880
reveal what appears to be the largest
imprisonment of people

164
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,160
on the basis of religion
since the Holocaust.

165
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,840
Saying anything is the largest
"since the Holocaust"

166
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,560
automatically makes whatever
you've just said worse.

167
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,840
The largest collection of shoes ?
Fun !

168
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,280
The largest collection of shoes
since the Holocaust ?

169
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,280
All of a sudden, really not fun.

170
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,560
And if this is the first time
that you're hearing

171
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,840
about an estimated million people
who've been held in detention camps,

172
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,040
mostly Uighurs, but also
Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities,

173
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,440
you are not alone.

174
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,520
And it's probably because
China has done its level best

175
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,120
to keep
this story from getting out.

176
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,080
But it may be getting harder
to ignore.

177
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,160
Just this week, we learned
that you may actually have

178
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,880
a personal connection to this
without even knowing it.

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,440
'Cause it turns out,
Uighurs are being shipped,

180
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,760
and not always willingly,
to work in factories across China.

181
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,720
Some of the products they're making
may be right in front of your face.

182
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,080
If you are one of the millions around
the world wearing a face mask

183
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,160
because of the coronavirus pandemic,
this footage may concern you.

184
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,160
It shows a group of Uighurs
arriving at a textile company

185
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,080
that started producing masks
in response to the pandemic.

186
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,520
We identified Chinese companies
that use Uighur labor to produce PPE.

187
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,920
We tracked some of their shipments

188
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,120
to consumers
in the U.S. and around the world.

189
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,960
Yeah, it's true: the very masks
that some in this country

190
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,120
see as unacceptable infringements
on their personal liberty

191
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,000
may be getting made by people

192
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,400
who would love for their worst
infringement to be

193
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,400
"getting politely asked
to leave a fucking Costco."

194
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,240
While there is nothing new about
horrific practices being hidden

195
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,720
deep in the supply chain
of global capitalism,

196
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,120
what is happening to the Uighurs
is particularly appalling.

197
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,600
So tonight, let's talk about them,
who they are,

198
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,760
what's been happening to them
and why.

199
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,640
Let's start with a bit of context.
11 million Uighurs live in Xinjiang,

200
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,320
in the far
northwest corner of China.

201
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,200
It's resource-rich
and it's strategically important.

202
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,840
Uighurs have always had

203
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,760
an uncomfortable relationship
with the authorities in Beijing,

204
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,000
they have their own language and
are culturally and ethnically distinct

205
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,760
from the rest
of China's population,

206
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,560
which is more
than 90 percent Han Chinese.

207
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,480
On top of which, there's the fact
that Uighurs are Muslim

208
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,720
in a country
that is aggressively secular.

209
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,720
So much so that a few years ago,
a Chinese reality show went to Dubai

210
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,400
and state TV censored all depictions
of a woman in a headscarf

211
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,600
in the weirdest possible way,
covering it with a cartoon helmet

212
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,680
and a shock of yellow hair
with a ghost in it

213
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,040
and covering her hijab
by obscuring her completely

214
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,040
with a cactus in a Santa hat,
even doing that

215
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,040
when she was reflected
in another person's sunglasses.

216
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,400
Setting aside the issue
of religious freedom for a second,

217
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,840
that's an amazing way to censor
someone out of a TV show.

218
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,880
I'm just saying, watching old episodes
of "House of Cards"

219
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,480
would be much less uncomfortable
if it looked like this instead.

220
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,400
Why'd you ask him to leave ?

221
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,080
Because I just wanted to look
in your eyes one more time

222
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,960
before we do this.

223
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,160
Francis, we're doing this.

224
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,920
See ?
That's just objectively much better !

225
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,560
Now you can enjoy "House of Cards"
just as much as you used to,

226
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,920
which was, a bit.

227
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,800
So, there was that baseline
difference there on top of which

228
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,040
some Han Chinese have held
bigoted views about the Uighurs.

229
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,120
Just listen to this interview
from back in 2008.

230
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,480
Here in Beijing, Uighurs
are dispersed across the city.

231
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,880
Many work
at restaurants and street stalls.

232
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,160
They stand out because
of their different features and dress.

233
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,120
Some Han Chinese are blatantly
prejudiced against them.

234
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,520
The people from
Xinjiang are not very good.

235
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,280
Robbers and thieves.

236
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,280
"Robbers and thieves."

237
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,080
That is not an acceptable way
to describe an entire ethnic group.

238
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,280
It's barely an acceptable way
to describe all raccoons.

239
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah, they are essentially
just kleptomaniac possums

240
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,360
who steal your trash
with their spooky little doll hands.

241
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,720
But that's not
all that they are.

242
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,560
All of this was exacerbated
by the Chinese government

243
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,520
encouraging Han people
to migrate to Xinjiang,

244
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,800
with them often being favored
over Uighurs for top jobs.

245
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,560
And these tensions and resentments

246
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,800
amid an overall atmosphere
of extreme discrimination

247
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,680
finally boiled over in 2009
with riots in the capital

248
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,360
that killed 200 people,
mostly Han Chinese.

249
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,800
Rather than address the complex
underlying factors behind those riots,

250
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,080
the Chinese government painted them
as religious terrorism,

251
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,320
beginning a decade-long crackdown
that's escalated steadily,

252
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,960
especially after China's president,
Xi Jinping, came to power,

253
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,160
and instituted what was called

254
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,480
the "Strike Hard Campaign
Against Violent Terrorism" in 2014.

255
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,320
And think of it
as the Patriot Act on steroids.

256
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,240
All of a sudden,
Uighurs started being treated

257
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,800
like they were all
potential terrorists.

258
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,160
Xinjiang is now one of the most
heavily policed areas in the world,

259
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,760
with the authorities surveilling

260
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,520
things that most people would find
utterly meaningless.

261
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,520
If you go through Uighur
neighborhoods or suburbs,

262
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,440
you see cameras over literally
every house entrance

263
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,440
so the government can see
who enters and who leaves.

264
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,560
How low is the bar for being
highlighted by the system ?

265
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,280
Are you socializing more or less
with your neighbors ?

266
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,840
Have you put gas
in somebody else's car ?

267
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,480
Are you going out the front door of
your house instead of the back door ?

268
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,040
That's how low the bar is.

269
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,600
It goes even further.
The government has a list

270
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,040
of "75 behavioral indications
of religious extremism",

271
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,360
with some as vague as "people
who store large amounts of food",

272
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,000
"those who smoke and drink
but quit doing so quite suddenly"

273
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,160
and "those who buy
or store equipment such as dumbbells"

274
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,880
"without obvious reasons."

275
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,640
Although that last one clearly
would not be an issue for me.

276
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,800
'Cause I got two pretty obvious reasons
for dumbbell ownership right here.

277
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,320
It's not called a work out if you don't
put the work in, Broseph Braun-rad.

278
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,080
Trust me,
they call me "The Lunch Lady"

279
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,920
'cause from the hours of 11 to one,
I don't stop stacking plates.

280
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,720
I call this one Jon and this one Taffer
because together, they lift up bars.

281
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,360
But look, China doesn't
just collect this information,

282
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,720
it feeds it into
a "predictive policing" system

283
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,560
that monitors for potential threats.

284
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,440
In one week, it flagged the names
of 24 000 people as suspicious,

285
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,480
15 000 of whom were then sent
to re-education camps.

286
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,640
When pressed on whether
any of this is strictly necessary,

287
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,240
Chinese officials will argue
that they are simply being proactive.

288
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,160
Some people,
before they commit murder,

289
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,600
already show
they are capable of it.

290
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,680
Should we wait for them to commit
a crime or prevent it from happening ?

291
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,840
Okay, that is both insane logic

292
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,160
and also the exact plot
of "Minority Report".

293
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,840
Which, if you haven't seen it,
very briefly:

294
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,440
the year's 2054,
Tom Cruise's John Anderton

295
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,040
is chief of Washington D.C.'s precrime
police department

296
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,880
where murders are stopped
before they happen.

297
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,800
Ethically, there are some questions
about the system.

298
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,760
Can you really be sure an individual
will commit the crimes

299
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,440
that the Precogs
say they'll commit ?

300
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,800
The Precogs, they are bald freaks
who sleep in an indoor swimming pool

301
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,840
and they scream whenever
they visualize a future murder.

302
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,560
I think they're all siblings
or aliens, or babies, I can't remember.

303
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,920
But basically, the murder rate
in the city is zero,

304
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,640
Anderton's doing well
and so the status quo remains.

305
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
One day,
the Precogs generate a prediction:

306
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,800
John Anderton will murder a man
he doesn't even know in just 36 hours.

307
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,120
But it couldn't be !
That's our hero, isn't it ?

308
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,760
So, he stages an escape,
gets an eye transplant

309
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,520
so he can't be detected by the city's
eye-based surveillance system,

310
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,680
finds out he's being framed,
then finds out that Max von Sydow,

311
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,560
yeah, by the way, he's in this too,
is gonna kill Anderton,

312
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,840
but decides not to.

313
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,000
Anderton doesn't kill the person
that he supposedly was going to,

314
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,240
disproving the very basis
of the precrime system

315
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,760
and proving that
people do have free choice.

316
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,880
So, in the end,
they shut down the program

317
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,960
and send the Precogs away
to live on a farm,

318
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,960
but not the death kind,
we assume.

319
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,840
Anyway, it's scary, but it's pretty
good. I'd say, three stars.

320
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,400
But the bigger point is:
people in Xinjiang have been arrested

321
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,240
and thrown in camps despite
having committed no crimes,

322
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,720
which is chilling.

323
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,440
A million Uighurs were, at one point,
being held extrajudicially,

324
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,080
many for acts as innocuous
as growing a beard,

325
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,720
fasting
or applying for a passport.

326
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,040
And this is a very sore subject
for the Chinese government,

327
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,120
which initially denied the existence
of the camps at all

328
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,160
before shifting to arguing they are
merely vocational training facilities.

329
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,560
Even the heavily-orchestrated
media tours suggest

330
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,440
their primary purpose
might be something else.

331
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,920
Authorities recently took
some diplomats and journalists

332
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,720
on a carefully supervised tour
of some of these facilities.

333
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,640
Some detainees told journalists
the camps re-educate them.

334
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,040
All of us found that we have
something wrong with ourselves.

335
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,800
And luckily, the Communist Party
and the government

336
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,800
offer this kind of school to us
for free.

337
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,560
If you're happy
and you know it say: "Yes, sir !"

338
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,480
If you're happy
and you know it say: "Yes, sir !"

339
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,400
Holy shit ! That might be
the single creepiest sing-along

340
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,280
I've ever heard
that doesn't involve Barney,

341
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,040
a dinosaur who is clearly aware
of clothing, he's wearing a hat,

342
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,400
and yet still actively chooses
to go bottomless around children.

343
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,880
You are an absolute monster.

344
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,920
And for all the Chinese government's
talk of "vocational training",

345
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,680
these camps
sure seem prison-like.

346
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,720
Leaked classified documents have
shown that staff at these facilities

347
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,440
were told to prevent students from
freely contacting the outside world

348
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,760
and that they should

349
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,040
"strictly manage and control student
activities to prevent escapes."

350
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,080
And the phrase "prevent escapes"
is something of a tell there.

351
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,000
If your employee handbook
says "prevent escape",

352
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,000
you're probably
working at a prison,

353
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,680
or at the very least,
a scientology picnic.

354
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,600
We're just here to grill some dogs,
play some tunes,

355
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,000
and if anyone asks where Shelly is,
do not let them escape.

356
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,360
If that weren't enough to make it clear
what these camps really are,

357
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,240
listen to one former detainee
describe what she went through.

358
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,320
Each woman gets two minutes
to go to the toilet.

359
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,680
They tell you to be "quick".
If you're not quick enough,

360
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,600
they shock you with an electric baton
on the back of your head.

361
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,640
It really hurt.
And they did it a lot.

362
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,560
Even after being shocked,
we had to say:

363
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,360
"Thank you, teacher.
We will not be late next time."

364
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,680
That is clearly
absolutely appalling.

365
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,280
I didn't think people had
to publicly thank abusers any more

366
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,000
now that Harvey Weinstein
doesn't go to award shows.

367
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,680
I'm not even getting into the reports
of forced abortions and sterilizations

368
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,760
of Uighur women,
which are absolutely horrific.

369
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,240
China will argue that this is
all about economic opportunity

370
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,160
and attempting to assimilate
a historically ostracized minority.

371
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,920
But assimilation, when forced,
is cultural erasure.

372
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,640
In addition to using mass detention
to keep families apart,

373
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,440
there are also rules that seem
to be trying to break the chain

374
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,440
by which families hand down
a culture and faith across generations,

375
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,760
from laws preventing
kids from going to mosques,

376
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,840
to a ban on baby names that
are considered too Islamic,

377
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,560
to the creation of state-run boarding
schools for Uighur children.

378
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,120
Other moves by China have been
even more on-the-nose,

379
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
like the destruction
of Uighur cemeteries.

380
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,920
The government turned
an enormous graveyard

381
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,040
where a prominent Uighur poet
was buried

382
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,440
into something called
"Happiness Park",

383
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,840
complete with fake pandas,
children's rides and a manmade lake.

384
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,800
I'm not saying that this
is the most important thing,

385
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,520
but this is one
of the pandas in question.

386
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,200
Frankly, I have never had
more questions.

387
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,520
Why is he holding a lollipop ?

388
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,160
Why does he have
the posture of a startled gopher ?

389
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,400
Why does he have an expression
that screams:

390
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,080
"I just had a lobotomy,
but it turns out,"

391
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,920
"I'm both happy about it
and surprisingly horny" ?

392
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,720
Frustratingly, we may
never know the answers.

393
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,280
As criticism of China's camps has
intensified in recent years,

394
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,960
the government seems
to be closing some of them.

395
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,320
Unfortunately though, they seem
to have shifted to staging sham trials

396
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,360
and transferring many Uighurs
to prisons

397
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,520
that aren't even pretending
to be training centers anymore.

398
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,480
China's also created a system of mass
labor transfers that sends Uighurs

399
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,920
and other ethnic minorities
into factory and service jobs,

400
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,880
sometimes hundreds or thousands
of miles from home.

401
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,720
That is how those masks
that we mentioned are getting made.

402
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,880
Chinese state media
presents this as a positive,

403
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,680
showing Uighur workers
arriving at a train station,

404
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,800
then being taken on a bus
to their new accommodations,

405
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,160
all with upbeat narration like this.

406
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:24,920
Up to now, Xinjiang has organized
transfers for around 178 000 workers,

407
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,800
providing them a stable employment
rate of over 92 percent.

408
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,960
You can't celebrate a stable workforce
when it is forced labor

409
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,480
anymore than you give me credit

410
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,040
for spending a lot of time with
my kids over the past few months.

411
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,120
Believe me, if I had any other choice,
I wouldn't be.

412
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,080
As you've probably guessed, this
isn't just a benevolent jobs program.

413
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,480
The idea, as one local government
report put it,

414
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,600
is that sending Uighurs
far from home will allow

415
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,840
for "distancing them from religiously
extreme views and educating them."

416
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,040
A lot of people
have been distanced.

417
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,560
One Australian think tank that
investigated forced labor estimated

418
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,240
that, conservatively,
over just a two-year period,

419
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,440
more than 80 000 Uyghurs
were transferred out of Xinjiang

420
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,360
to work in factories across China.

421
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,880
They also found over 80 companies
directly or indirectly benefiting

422
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,800
from Uighur labor
in their supply chains,

423
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,680
some of them big international
brands like Nike.

424
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,520
When "The Washington Post" visited
the factory of one of Nike's suppliers,

425
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,760
it found Uighur workers were
forced to attend patriotic education

426
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,360
and Mandarin classes, and live in
dormitories under constant supervision,

427
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,600
with one worker saying:

428
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,280
"We can walk around, but we can't
go back to Xinjiang on our own."

429
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,360
Nike has claimed that this factory
no longer employs Uighur workers

430
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,160
and they told us that they "take any
reports about forced labor seriously"

431
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,960
and they're "conducting ongoing
diligence with our suppliers in China."

432
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,640
Which, given what "The Post" found,
feels like their policy on oversight

433
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,280
is less "Just Do It" than

434
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,880
"Just Talk About Doing It and Hope
People Eventually Stop Asking."

435
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,680
It's not just Nike. Another company
on the list is Volkswagen,

436
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,720
which told us they found no indications
of forced labor in their supply chain,

437
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,200
though, it is worth noting that last
year, their CEO was challenged

438
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,640
about whether China's treatment
of the Uighurs gave him pause

439
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,280
and this was his response.

440
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,320
We are absolutely proud to also
create workplaces in that region,

441
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,240
which we think is very useful.

442
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,120
But Xinxiang is something you're
not proud to be associated with

443
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,560
in terms of what the government
is doing to Uighur people...

444
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,520
- I can't judge that, sorry.
- Can't judge it ? But you know ?

445
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,880
I don't know
what you're referring to.

446
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,160
You don't know about

447
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,480
China's re-education camps
for a million Uighur people,

448
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,800
it has referred to as re-education
camps as part

449
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,080
of its counter-terror threat
in the west of this country.

450
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,320
- You don't know about that ?
- I'm not aware of that.

451
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,720
Finding out that Volkswagen
is overlooking a human rights crisis

452
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,200
is kind of a lot like finding out your
grandparents are still having sex.

453
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,480
It's completely horrifying, but
it really shouldn't be too shocking.

454
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,440
After all, they've been
doing it since World War II.

455
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,360
I can understand why companies
and others might want to turn away

456
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,640
from what's going on in Xinjiang,
because it's harrowing.

457
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,800
Remember that woman
who got electric shocks

458
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,480
for taking
too long in the bathroom ?

459
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,040
She was in two different camps,

460
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,120
then was transferred
into forced labor at a glove factory,

461
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,320
all while separated from her family
for two years.

462
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,280
While they were eventually reunited,

463
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,200
they are understandably
still haunted to this day.

464
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,560
For two years
you didn't see your mom ?

465
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,440
I missed my Mommy.

466
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,960
Don't cry, Mommy.

467
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,840
Please don't cry.

468
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,960
Don't cry Mommy. I told you
not to show your tears.

469
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,840
That is heartbreaking
and completely indefensible.

470
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,360
And whenever pressed on this,

471
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,960
the Chinese government has been
quick to use whataboutism.

472
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,680
They responded to U.S. criticism
by invoking atrocities

473
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,080
ranging from the genocide of Native
Americans to a statement that read:

474
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,120
"George Floyd's death shows
that US systemic racism"

475
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,880
"has choked ethnic minorities so hard
that they 'can't breathe.'"

476
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,040
Those are fair hits.
Those are fair points right there.

477
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:14,040
It's also possible for two things
to be wrong at the same time.

478
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,280
I know the U.S.-China relationship
is complicated, particularly right now,

479
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,280
and too often, it descends
into reductive, xenophobic,

480
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,240
us-versus-them stereotypes.

481
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,840
Human rights should be
completely non-negotiable.

482
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,720
I will say, the U.S. has taken some
small steps here,

483
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,320
like imposing sanctions
against top Chinese officials,

484
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,240
and Congress even passed
the Uighur Human Rights Policy Act.

485
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,160
Although Trump signed it,
he also reportedly told Xi Jinping

486
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,200
that he should go ahead
with building the camps

487
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,320
because he thought it was
exactly the right thing to do.

488
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,200
Which, from a foreign policy, a human
rights and a political perspective,

489
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,640
and even an interpersonal perspective,
is exactly the wrong thing to do.

490
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,040
But look: this clearly
isn't just about Trump, is it ?

491
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,800
Going forward, the entire global
community needs to do more.

492
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,240
The U.N. should have
independent investigators

493
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,120
looking into what China
has done in Xinjiang,

494
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,360
governments around the world
should be speaking out

495
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,560
about the treatment of Uighurs without
bending to China's economic influence

496
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,800
and big multinational
companies like Nike and VW

497
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,160
should not only be working
to clean up their supply chains,

498
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,040
but also actively using
their financial leverage

499
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,800
to pressure the Chinese
government to end these abuses.

500
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,840
None of that is gonna happen
unless people pay attention.

501
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,760
I know that raising awareness

502
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,560
is often a bullshit solution
that doesn't really solve a problem.

503
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,360
But there can be a real
benefit to awareness,

504
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,080
even if it is coming through
a TikTok makeup tutorial,

505
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,640
or let's say,
the exact opposite of one.

506
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,520
Because in this instance,

507
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,040
awareness is actually a necessary
precondition for action.

508
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,400
I know there is a lot
to worry about right now,

509
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,480
from a raging pandemic
to an ugly presidential election,

510
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,440
to a purple pervert who couldn't
give a fuck about pants...

511
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,880
We have to make sure
that the treatment of Uighurs

512
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,320
is also on that list.

513
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,960
When you're dealing with a concerted
campaign centered on cultural erasure,

514
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,880
one of the most important things
we can do is continue to pay attention.

515
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,720
At the very least,
so that if an entire culture

516
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,440
is replaced
by a horny lobotomized panda,

517
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,440
we'll know to stand up
and fucking say something.

518
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,880
And now this.

519
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:27,120
We Promise You: These People
Are Not Saying "Masturbate".

520
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,640
This morning, as Covid cases
mount across the country,

521
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,960
the mask debate is intensifying.

522
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,720
People are very passionate on both
sides of the great mask debate.

523
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,400
The partisan mask debate
is heating up.

524
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,560
Mask debate's growing.

525
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,400
The president is trying to have
us cover the mask debate.

526
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,040
CVS, Target, and Walgreens are
getting in on the mask debate.

527
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,200
The mask debate now taking
center stage at local restaurants.

528
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,480
It's nine minutes after 6:00, there's
new video of a raging mask debate.

529
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,720
The mask debate
in Georgia is getting ugly.

530
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,320
The great mask debate in West Virginia
might soon be coming to an end.

531
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,360
This mask debate is far from over.

532
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,840
How many mask debates
have you gotten into? Love to hear it.

533
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,240
The mask debate was taken
to a whole 'nother level.

534
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,800
Bishop David Zubik tells
Pittsburgh's Action News 4

535
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,080
he found himself
in the middle of a mask debate.

536
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,200
We'll dive deeper
into this pet store mask debate.

537
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,680
So, we're gonna begin with this thing
we're calling "The Great Mask Debate."

538
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,120
That's our show, thanks for watching.
See you next week, goodnight !

539
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,640
Come on, China.

540
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,880
Get that cactus off me, China.
We're just trying to do credits.

541
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,280
Please.
Why is he wearing a Santa hat ?

542
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,800
And a scarf ? Do cactuses
get fucking cold ?

543
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,920
China, please !
