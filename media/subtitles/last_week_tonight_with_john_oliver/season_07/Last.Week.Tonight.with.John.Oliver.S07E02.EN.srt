LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,680
Season VII
Episode 2

3
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,000
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,880
I'm John Oliver. Thank you
so much for joining us.

5
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,200
Just time
for a quick recap of the week,

6
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,840
which has been dominated
by Donald Trump airing his grievances

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,760
with the justice system
for its treatment of Roger Stone,

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,320
with intelligence officials for warning
that Russia tries to get him re-elected

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,560
and, for some reason,
with the Oscars from two weeks ago.

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,080
And the winner
is a movie from South Korea.

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,000
What the hell was that all about ?
Was it good ? I don't know.

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,120
Y'know, I'm looking for like...

13
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,640
Can we get, like,
"Gone With The Wind" back, please ?

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,960
Of course Trump
loves "Gone With The Wind".

15
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,560
He likes his movies
like he likes his rallies:

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,280
excruciatingly long, incredibly racist,
and centered around a rich creep

17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,440
who leaves a woman
crying in a mansion.

18
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,400
Of course he likes it,
it's so on brand.

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,960
Instead of getting
sucked into Trumps world,

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,400
instead, let's move on
to the Democratic primary,

21
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,440
a fun contest where the winner
gets a new nickname from the president

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,840
before ultimately losing
the Electoral College.

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,680
While the end of this week brought
Sanders another primary victory,

24
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,560
much of the media's attention
was focused on someone else.

25
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,680
We've been talking about Bloomberg's
candidacy for president.

26
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,960
We're all here
talking about Mike Bloomberg.

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,600
Everybody's been talking
about Bloomberg.

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,000
You hear voters saying:

29
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,240
"This guy says he can beat Trump
and he's got the money to do it."

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,360
They kind of like dating Pete,
they like dating Amy,

31
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,680
but they like the guy who can take them
to the prom in the best looking gown,

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,720
and the biggest flowers,
and that's Bloomberg.

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,320
What are you talking about ?
That is such a creepy thing to say !

34
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,680
Although just for the record,

35
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,320
nobody is hoping that Mike Bloomberg
will take them to the prom.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,480
I get why you might confuse him
with a prom date,

37
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,720
he's awkward,
looks uncomfortable in a suit,

38
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,040
and he's a virgin.

39
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,720
I know he technically
has two daughters,

40
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,640
but that doesn't change the fact that
Bloomberg has big virgin energy.

41
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,760
It is true that Bloomberg
has been getting a lot of attention.

42
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,840
And before his horrendous,
flop-sweat-laden display

43
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,680
at his first debate on Wednesday,

44
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,560
one poll put him in second
place behind Bernie Sanders.

45
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,600
Even if he drops in the polls,
don't expect him to go away soon.

46
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,600
He doesn't have to. He's personally
spent more than $400 million,

47
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,040
mostly on ads,
in the last few months.

48
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,720
Google and Facebook have served up
2 billion Bloomberg ads,

49
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,480
which has worked out
to roughly 30 000 a minute.

50
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,080
You can't have missed them,
they're absolutely everywhere.

51
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,640
At this point, they are genuinely
hard to av... What the fuck ?

52
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,720
There's one right now !
How did you get here ?

53
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,720
You should not be here !
Get out of here.

54
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,200
I didn't ask for you.
Get out of here !

55
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,000
Unbelievable.

56
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,680
For all the things that you might
like about Bloomberg,

57
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,560
his funding of gun control
and climate change initiatives,

58
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,320
there is much more to dislike.

59
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,880
Let's start with the fact that
he is truly charisma impaired,

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,880
as you can see in campaign
videos like this one,

61
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,560
and I have to tell you,
I promise, this is the entire thing.

62
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,440
Where's my ice cream ?
Thank you.

63
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,000
Big Gay Ice Cream is the best.

64
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,400
Okay.

65
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,960
I don't know what's grosser,

66
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,920
watching Bloomberg desperately
pander to gay voters

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,720
or watching him mechanically eat
a spoonful of ice cream and say...

68
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,960
Like an alien wearing a human suit
who's trying to fit in at a Cold Stone.

69
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,560
To combat that personality problem,

70
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,400
Bloomberg has poured a ton of money
into buying credibility online.

71
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,880
His campaign is paying
popular Instagram accounts

72
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,880
to create memes like these to make him
seem like the fun candidate.

73
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,440
Here's just one example:

74
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,640
an image of Danny DeVito labeled:
"Trump's bank account"

75
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,720
and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson
labeled: "Bloomberg's bank account".

76
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,360
Bloomberg's campaign has been paying
for sponsored content

77
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,680
on popular Instagram meme
accounts like grapejuiceboys,

78
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,000
fuckjerry and shitheadsteve.

79
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,880
And I, for one,
am incredibly disappointed.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,200
For so many years, shitheadsteve
was a bastion of editorial integrity

81
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,920
in the meme landscape.

82
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,600
I don't know
if I can ever even look

83
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,880
at another of his memes
the same way now.

84
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,960
Even this recent classic,
a photo of a plane reading:

85
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,960
"Longer, Larger, Fart" and captioned
"When you have diahrea" misspelled.

86
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,080
It loses some of its magic.

87
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,240
It's still funny and smart and good
and above all necessary.

88
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,560
But shitheadsteve
is just tainted for me now.

89
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,000
All this spending cannot and should not
paper over Bloomberg's past.

90
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,400
Not just his long history of sexist,
racist comments.

91
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,560
For those of us
who live in New York,

92
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,280
his true legacy was the massive
expansion of stop-and-frisk,

93
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,920
a policy empowering
police to stop, question

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,720
and search anyone they suspected
of involvement in criminal activity.

95
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,520
While Bloomberg was mayor, the police
recorded over 5 million of these stops.

96
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,800
In 2011 alone there were
nearly 700 000 of them

97
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,080
and that's in a city
of just over eight million people.

98
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,640
For some communities, it was
a decade of constant harassment.

99
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,960
Frustrated by how often he was being
stopped in his Harlem neighborhood,

100
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,160
a 16-year old son of a cop named Alvin

101
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,800
says he hit record on his iPod
one night in 2011.

102
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,360
Why you pushing me like that for ?

103
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,720
As two undercover
officers approached.

104
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,360
We look for suspicious behavior.
When you keep looking at us...

105
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,120
Y'all always like stop...
I got stopped 2 blocks away.

106
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,480
When you're walking the block with
your hood up and keep looking back,

107
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,640
we think
you might have something.

108
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,240
- Do you want to go to jail ?
- What for ? For what ?

109
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,240
- Shut your f...g mouth, kid !
- What am I getting arrested for ?

110
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,640
For being a f...g mutt.

111
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,000
That is obviously awful.
And I do know that people of color

112
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,560
have been dealing
with shit like that forever

113
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,240
and don't need their experience
validated by somebody like me,

114
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,560
who is so white he looks like the ghost
of a stork who died of a milk overdose

115
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,320
while listening
to "Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me !"

116
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,800
I know what I am.
But this policy was appalling

117
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,240
and fell disproportionately
on black and Latino New Yorkers,

118
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,840
who were the target of over
80 percent of the stops at its peak,

119
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,560
something for which Bloomberg
was completely unrepentant.

120
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,800
They just keep saying:

121
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,680
"It's a disproportionate percentage
of a particular ethnic group."

122
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,520
That may be, but it's not
a disproportionate percentage

123
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,040
of those who witnesses and victims
describe as committing the murder.

124
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,520
In that case, incidentally,
I think we disproportionately stop

125
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,720
whites too much
and minorities too little.

126
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,560
Okay, I get it.

127
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,200
So, the only problem was that
you weren't racial profiling enough.

128
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,560
To put that in a way that Bloomberg
thinks young people would understand,

129
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,480
this meme compares how
big of an asshole Bloomberg was,

130
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,760
versus how big of an asshole
Bloomberg wishes he had been.

131
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,400
And despite him claiming
that it made the city safer,

132
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,800
the crime rate dropped even
after the policy was curtailed.

133
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,800
Stop-and-frisk was harmful
and unnecessary.

134
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,400
While Bloomberg apologized for it,
he only did it last November,

135
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,800
days before he launched
his presidential campaign.

136
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,720
He does not seem to understand

137
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,280
why people
are so suspicious about that timing.

138
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,720
The mark of a intelligent,
competent person

139
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,080
is when they make a mistake,
they have the guts to stand up and say:

140
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,640
"I made a mistake,
I'm sorry."

141
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,920
We don't question your belief
that you made a mistake.

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,120
The question is the timing that you
realized you made the mistake.

143
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,120
Nobody asked me about it until
I started running for president.

144
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,200
So, come on.

145
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,520
Yeah, come on, Gayle ! Mike Bloomberg
was just minding his own business,

146
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,880
doing nothing illegal, and you started
shaking him down out of nowhere ?

147
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,360
It's wrong, Gayle.

148
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,200
As soon as he had something to gain
from apologizing, he did !

149
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,120
And he did it like a man,
begrudgingly and once.

150
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,960
It is kind of amazing that Bloomberg
seems to think that his money

151
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,680
can make people
forget about all of this.

152
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,120
Hopefully, the more people talk about
him now, the more they'll discover

153
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
how unpalatable he is.

154
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,120
If I may put this in terms
that Bloomberg enjoys,

155
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,920
let's hope that
this woman is the presidency,

156
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,240
this guy is Mike Bloomberg
and this is everyone else going:

157
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,880
"Don't even fucking think
about it." And now this.

158
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,600
Larry King Wants To Know
Everything About His Guests.

159
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,000
- Show your binging on right now ?
- "Temptation Island."

160
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,240
- An animal you wish you could talk to.
- I guess a dolphin.

161
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,720
Who is your childhood celebrity crush ?

162
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,120
First thing you do when
you get out of bed in the morning ?

163
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,800
What's a piece of technology
you don't get ?

164
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,320
Who would you like
to play you in a biopic ?

165
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,400
Where's a place
we'd find you on your day off ?

166
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,680
Three things you'd bring with you
to a desert island ?

167
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,760
What's the biggest difference
between the US and Canada ?

168
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,240
What's the biggest difference between
America and Scotland ?

169
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,560
What's the best thing
about living in the U.K. ?

170
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,560
When do you feel most free ?
What's your guilty pleasure ?

171
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,880
What pisses you off ?

172
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,520
Is there something you long believed
to be true and then realized wasn't ?

173
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,640
How do people who do a podcast know
how many people are listening ?

174
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,320
What's the most challenging
style of dance to perform ?

175
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,560
Favorite fashion risk taker ?

176
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,000
Tell me something people
don't know about Nick Kroll.

177
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,560
A queen who didn't win Drag Race
but should have ?

178
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,440
Who's your favorite bad ass bitch ?
Do you like oatmeal ?

179
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,440
Moving on.

180
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,960
Our main story
tonight concerns India.

181
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,680
It just narrowly beats out America
as the country

182
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,200
where a 20-minute lecture
in this accent is the least welcome.

183
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:30,080
India is preparing for a very important
visitor who is arriving tomorrow.

184
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,920
Donald Trump's first visit to India
will be a special one.

185
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,320
He will be accompanied by
the First Lady Melania Trump.

186
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,560
Many are wondering if they will
make an unscheduled visit

187
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,320
to the Taj Mahal,
the enduring symbol of love.

188
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,600
Why wouldn't they do that ?
What makes you think

189
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,400
this happy couple would not want
to visit an enduring symbol of love ?

190
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,920
Every trip is a honeymoon
for these two lovebirds. Couple goals.

191
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,120
Trump's first state visit
to India begins tomorrow.

192
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,440
And at the center of it will be
Prime Minister Narendra Modi,

193
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,320
a man for whom Trump seems
to have a great deal of affection.

194
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,560
Listen to him talk about Modi when
they met up last September.

195
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,040
He's a great gentleman
and a great leader.

196
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,600
And I remember India before.
Now, not intimately,

197
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,120
but I remember India before
and it was very torn.

198
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,480
There was a lot of dissension,
a lot of fighting.

199
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,840
He brought it all together,
like a father would bring it together.

200
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,680
Maybe he's the father of India.

201
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,560
We'll call him "the father of India".
I think that's not so bad.

202
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,280
Yeah, that's not so bad, is it ?
You know what a father is, right ?

203
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,240
It's a guy who brings the family
together by giving them lots of money

204
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,000
but never emotional validation.

205
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,360
That means the remainder of your life
is spent in a series of grasping quests

206
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,960
for recognition and unconditional love
from everyone around you

207
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,640
and if anyone doesn't love you enough,
you hate them and want them to die.

208
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,720
This life is like being in a boat made
of friends who think you're the best

209
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,280
and anyone who doesn't think
that is a small hole in your boat

210
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,240
and it lets the water in,
you sink below the waves,

211
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,840
and there's nothing left but you,
drowning in the silent, screaming abyss

212
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,560
that your father bestowed to you
as your birthright.

213
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,320
Modi is like that for India.
You know, a father.

214
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,000
A daddy.
But calling Modi the "Father of India"

215
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,760
is completely inappropriate,
for multiple reasons,

216
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,520
not the least of which is that
there's a certain Gandhi

217
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,080
who already holds
that exact fucking title.

218
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,680
Which is not to say
that Modi is not popular. He is.

219
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,960
He was recently overwhelmingly
re-elected for a second five-year term,

220
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,880
his rallies often feature supporters
wearing masks of his face.

221
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,040
While I do get that that is
intended as a show of support,

222
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,000
please don't ever come to this
show and do that.

223
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,520
That is literally my nightmare.

224
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,200
Modi's cult of personality
extends well beyond India.

225
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,440
You may be aware of him as one of the
most aggressive huggers in the world,

226
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,440
or from his charming appearance on
"Man vs. Wild" with Bear Grylls.

227
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,400
Here we go...

228
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,240
If you wondered if there's elephant.
There is definitely elephant.

229
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,520
Have a smell.
That's good honest...

230
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,160
It's now fertilizer.

231
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,440
And when it is really fresh. And it's
really wet, straight out of the anus.

232
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,560
Once in Africa
I squeezed it like this...

233
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,720
And all the juice... Because it was
almost sterile. But not today.

234
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:25,160
I know that seems gross, but remember,
that dung is straight out of the anus.

235
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,720
Nothing better
than elephant dung

236
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,400
when it's fresh from the butthole,
direct from the rectum,

237
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,400
still convalescin'
from the small intestine.

238
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,160
I am ride or die for
Team Straight From The Anus,

239
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,320
none of that processed
elephant dung,

240
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,360
none of that "I Can't Believe It's Not
From An Elephant's Anus !" nonsense

241
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,000
and certainly
not Stevia's Elephant Dung.

242
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,400
I know it has less calories
than anus dung

243
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,120
but it tastes like shit
in exactly the wrong way.

244
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,080
While Modi may have charmed
Bear Grylls, the world,

245
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,680
and our current president,

246
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,600
within India, he's an increasingly
controversial figure.

247
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,080
His government has pursued

248
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,200
a steadily-escalating persecution
of religious minorities,

249
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,600
persecution so intense
that for the last two months,

250
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,400
Indians across the country have been
taking to the streets in anger.

251
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,880
On Sunday in New Delhi,
the protests turned violent.

252
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,040
Police fired tear gas
and clashed with students,

253
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,800
who accused officers
of indiscriminate violence.

254
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,680
At least a hundred were injured.
Protestors torched public buses.

255
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,520
Burnt-out buses generally aren't a sign
that people are happy with you.

256
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,120
It's the gesture that says:

257
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,480
"You suck so hard I don't even
care how I get home."

258
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,640
And if citizens
in the world's largest democracy,

259
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,480
home to over a billion people,

260
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,920
are either wearing masks of Modi
or marching in the streets,

261
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,240
it seems like tonight it might be
worth exploring why that is,

262
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,840
where things could be heading

263
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,280
and why calling Modi
"The Father of India"

264
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,320
is stupid at best
and dangerous at worst.

265
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,840
Let's start by acknowledging
Modi's significant appeal.

266
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,240
He has an inspirational personal
story. He grew up poor

267
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,520
and rose from selling tea on railway
platforms in Gujarat

268
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,120
to running that state, and,
eventually, the entire country.

269
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,520
His election in 2014 was actually
the subject of our very first show,

270
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,440
back when he looked the same
and I looked 30 years younger.

271
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,400
If this is happening because
someone is slowly poisoning me,

272
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,720
please do it faster.

273
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,200
Modi ran as a populist
and since becoming prime minister,

274
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,640
has taken one big swing after another,

275
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,520
often with the goal
of improving the lives of the poor.

276
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,040
He's had some success.

277
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,480
He's delivered new cooking gas
connections to 72 million poor families

278
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,640
and he fulfilled a campaign promise
to build over 110 million toilets.

279
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,440
Which is a big deal. That addressed
a major public health hazard.

280
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,560
So much so that,
a few years back,

281
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,280
UNICEF India launched a campaign
called "Take Your Poo To The Loo".

282
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,720
First thing in the morning,
what do I see ?

283
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:07,400
A pile of shit, staring at me.
I close my eyes, I step away.

284
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,000
No matter where I go,
there's no getting away.

285
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,880
Let's take the poo to the loo.

286
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,480
Yes, exactly !
That is catchy.

287
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,160
That is my new favorite song.
And it will remain so

288
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,760
until the inevitable "Take Your Poo
To The Old Town Road" remix.

289
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,360
And then that will be my favorite.

290
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,000
But Modi has had
some big swing-and-misses, too,

291
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,360
like during his first term,

292
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,960
when he decided to fight corruption
and money laundering

293
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,320
by cancelling some of the most
commonly used bank notes in India,

294
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,680
with just four hours' notice.

295
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,560
Which went about as well
as you might expect.

296
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,120
Today as banks open for the first time
since the surprise announcement,

297
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,320
there was chaos.

298
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,040
People lined up for hours
to change their money,

299
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,520
some had to be turned away
because the banks just ran out cash.

300
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,240
They are not giving us money.

301
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,880
They keep telling me:
"Come on Monday."

302
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,440
I've been standing in the queue
for three days now

303
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,880
and I haven't gotten any money.

304
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,000
Yeah, that's ridiculous,
and an entirely predictable consequence

305
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,840
of announcing,
without any warning,

306
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,360
that 86 percent of Indian money
was no longer money.

307
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,400
Think about what would happen here
if Trump suddenly announced that,

308
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,320
as of midnight, every 10
and $20 bill is worthless.

309
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,560
It would be complete mayhem !
Republicans would defend it,

310
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,120
the Supreme Court would uphold it
and within two weeks,

311
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,320
people would be holding up signs
denouncing money at Trump rallies,

312
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,360
'cause that's the fucking world
we seem to live in now.

313
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,240
Modi's policy was a mess.
It caused complete chaos

314
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,880
and it didn't even make
a dent in corruption.

315
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,240
Yet, incredibly, it didn't make him
any less popular.

316
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,480
That is actually
one of Modi's greatest strengths:

317
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,520
his charisma is such that he somehow
evades public anger sticking to him,

318
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,800
which is a very
dangerous superpower,

319
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,760
especially when you consider how
extreme one of his defining beliefs is.

320
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,440
Modi is a Hindu nationalist
and at the core of that

321
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,920
is a belief that India
is a fundamentally Hindu nation,

322
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,320
which is provocative,

323
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,720
given that India's founders,
Gandhi and Nehru,

324
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,160
explicitly disavowed that,
with Gandhi saying:

325
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,840
"The State should
undoubtedly be secular."

326
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,760
Yet, throughout his career,
Modi's party, the BJP, has served

327
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:34,400
as political arm of a hardcore Hindu
nationalist paramilitary group, RSS.

328
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,760
I know that I've just thrown
a lot of letters at you there,

329
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,240
but if there is one thing that I'd like
you to know about the RSS

330
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,160
and, by extension Modi's party,
it is this.

331
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,000
The RSS was formed in 1925
by Keshav Baliram Hedgewar

332
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,680
with the purpose
of creating a Hindu unity.

333
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,320
Early leaders such as M.S. Golwalkar
admired Adolf Hitler

334
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,560
and the Nazi movement for steps
taken to ensure, quote:

335
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,840
"the purity of the race
and its culture."

336
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,680
That is true ! The founders
of the RSS admired Hitler

337
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,920
for ensuring
"the purity of the race."

338
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,240
Which is just not a chill thing
to admire Hitler for.

339
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,040
There is one and only one thing
that it's okay to admire Hitler for

340
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,360
and it's the fact
that he killed Hitler.

341
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,760
Everyone talks a big game
when it comes to killing Hitler,

342
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,240
but to be fair, Hitler is the only one
who stepped up and got it done

343
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,520
and for that I say:
"Way to go, Hitler !"

344
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,320
All the other Hitlering that Hitler
did: thumbs down.

345
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,960
But that very last bitler of Hitler:
thumbs up.

346
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,000
Do not take that image
out of context !

347
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,480
It is extremely worrying to have
a prime minister with that association.

348
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,160
Especially because India has
always struggled to strike a balance

349
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,800
between its ideals of tolerance
and the reality of religious tensions,

350
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,680
which have erupted
multiple times over the years.

351
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,720
Modi himself was right at the center
of one of those eruptions.

352
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,960
In 2002, violent riots broke out
along sectarian lines across Gujarat,

353
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,240
killing more than a thousand people,
mostly Muslims.

354
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,120
Modi oversaw all of this,
as head of the state,

355
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,760
and is blamed for doing nothing
to stop the violence.

356
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,880
The US revoked the leader's visa
over the incidents in 2005.

357
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,400
And that is not good. And what
somehow makes it even worse

358
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,120
is that Modi has offered at most tepid
apologies for his actions back then,

359
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,240
once even walking out of an interview

360
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,200
when asked if he regretted
that the killings happened.

361
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,000
Which is just not okay.

362
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,840
When you are being asked about your
role in the deaths of thousands,

363
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,480
you simply don't get to walk out
of an interview.

364
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,120
That kind of behavior is reserved for
Adam Driver in an NPR interview

365
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,400
about "Marriage Story",
and that is only because

366
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,040
Adam Driver can do
whatever the fuck he wants.

367
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,360
Step on my throat, Adam Driver,
you rudely large man.

368
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,720
Break my fingers,
you brooding mountain.

369
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,520
Modi has employed a similar tactic
of strategic quiet as prime minister.

370
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,960
He doesn't talk much
about religious minorities,

371
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,920
but those closest to him
are comfortable saying a lot.

372
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,760
India is home to the second largest
population of Muslims on earth

373
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,320
and many members of the BJP
have openly targeted them.

374
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,120
When it came time for Modi
and his party to appoint

375
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,160
a chief minister of Uttar Pradesh,
that's home to 200 million people,

376
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,680
they chose Yogi Adityanath,
a man who has said things like this.

377
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:37,040
Hindus and Muslims
are two different cultures,

378
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,280
these two cannot coexist.

379
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,680
If they kill one Hindu
then we will also kill 100 of them.

380
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,000
Holy shit. That is not even
dog whistle islamophobia,

381
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,360
that's basically just writing:
"We hate Muslims" on a dog

382
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,240
and then throwing that dog
at the nearest Muslim.

383
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,720
That rhetoric is an affront
to everything that India stands for.

384
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,440
Gandhi and Nehru, founders of modern
India, stood for religious pluralism,

385
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,200
meaning they encouraged
the coexistence of diverse faiths.

386
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,960
You may need to remember that,
because Modi and his party

387
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,760
are now actively trying to erase
whole sections of India's history.

388
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,480
Nehru has been edited out of some
history textbooks altogether.

389
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,360
What has been added to the curriculum
is pretty eye-catching.

390
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,600
In June 2014,
the Gujarat government introduced

391
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,800
a set of 10 textbooks
for primary schools.

392
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,120
Most lessons revolve around
the idea of Indian supremacy.

393
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,480
On page 22 of a book

394
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,720
there's a very interesting story
about how God created the world.

395
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,920
He was making bread and he took it
out of the oven too early

396
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,080
and that's how white people
were created.

397
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,240
The second time around,
he left it in the oven too long,

398
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,800
and that's how negroes were born,
the book uses the word "negro".

399
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,000
The last time around he learned
from his two previous mistakes

400
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,880
and took the bread out just in time
and that's how Indians were created.

401
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,800
Okay.
There is clearly a lot wrong with that,

402
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,520
but, for starters: that's just not
how white people were created.

403
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,800
I don't want to get too technical,
but white people were created

404
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,800
when a sale at Kohl's fucked a true
crime podcast.

405
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,200
That's how it happened.
I'm not gonna go into it anymore,

406
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,160
but that is our origin story
right there.

407
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,040
And look this isn't...
Stop it !

408
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,520
This isn't just a cultural battle.
Since winning reelection,

409
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,000
Modi has moved from quiet
support for religious intolerance,

410
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,800
to concrete action
and in classic Modi fashion,

411
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,600
he's done it with a big swing.

412
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,400
Remember those protests
I showed you earlier ?

413
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,120
They were sparked
by a very controversial act.

414
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,760
The government's planning to publish
a nationwide register of citizens.

415
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,400
Everyone would be forced to provide
documents to prove they're Indian.

416
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,040
Those who can't, would be
considered illegal immigrants.

417
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,680
Only non-Muslims would be protected
under the new citizenship law.

418
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,960
It's true. Modi and his party
may be about to strip

419
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,560
millions of Muslims of citizenship

420
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,000
and they did it in a diabolically
clever two-step way.

421
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,960
They announced they'd be rolling out
a national register of citizens, NRC,

422
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,280
everyone would provide documents
proving they were Indian citizens,

423
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,200
something that many, particularly
the poor or illiterate, do not have.

424
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,480
That alone did not target Muslims,
but here is the second part.

425
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,840
Modi's government also introduced
the Citizenship Amendment Bill, CAB,

426
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,480
which granted citizenship
to undocumented people

427
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,640
if they were from any religious
minority but Muslims.

428
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,880
NRC kicks everyone who's
undocumented off the citizenship rolls.

429
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,120
And the CAB lets everyone back on,
except Muslims.

430
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,760
They're basically Marie Kondo-ing India

431
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,400
and it's only Muslims
that don't seem to spark joy in them.

432
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,120
While Modi has insisted that in no way
is his intent to target Muslims,

433
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,480
his closest confidante and basic
second-in-command, Amit Shah,

434
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,480
has been unambiguous

435
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,440
about what the combination of these
two steps is designed to do.

436
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,880
Through CAB, we will give citizenship
to all the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist,

437
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,640
Jain, Christian refugees.

438
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,360
After that, pay attention, friends.
We'll implement NRC.

439
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,320
Should we throw out
the infiltrators or not ?

440
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,120
The infiltrators are sucking the blood
of this country like parasites.

441
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,080
"Infiltrators are sucking
our blood like parasites."

442
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,960
Remember, Amit Shah
is basically Modi's right hand.

443
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,280
If you don't disavow what your right
hand is doing, that is then on you.

444
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,920
If Kermit the Frog told you
the Lindbergh Baby had it coming,

445
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,720
you might go: "Jim, are you gonna
say something about this ?"

446
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,280
"You're not ?
What is wrong with you, Jim ?"

447
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,320
"Stop the frog saying this stuff.
You have the power to do that !"

448
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,000
These citizenship laws have had
a huge impact across India,

449
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,480
with many terrified,
especially as the government

450
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,160
is now building detention camps
for all the illegal immigrants

451
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,480
they are creating.

452
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,920
There is a cruel irony for some
of those building the camps.

453
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
It's a detention camp in the making,

454
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,400
about 450 laborers working on
its construction since December.

455
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:31,840
Among them, Nayaz Ali, who might end
up living here once it's completed.

456
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,400
I am very worried because my name
didn't come up in the list of NRC.

457
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,440
I don't know
what will happen next.

458
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,560
I work here during the day
and think about my future at night.

459
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,720
That man is building a detention
center that he may end up inside.

460
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,280
That is the most nauseating thing
that I have seen tonight,

461
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,680
and I'll remind you
that just 16 minutes ago,

462
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,720
I showed you a man squeezing fresh
elephant shit into his own mouth.

463
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,760
All of this is really dangerous.

464
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,600
And I'd say that this atmosphere
could get someone killed,

465
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,080
but it already has.

466
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,800
Since Modi came to power,

467
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,880
there has been an overall rise
in attacks against minorities.

468
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,400
And it is incredibly depressing
to see India heading in this direction.

469
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,440
The only glimmer of hope here

470
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,560
is that, for perhaps the first time
in Modi's whole career,

471
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,040
his actions are creating a massive
and sustained backlash.

472
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,200
Even as Trump shows up
to hail him for uniting India,

473
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,920
the protests against him
are very much ongoing.

474
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,040
While Modi has tried to paint them
as the work of Muslim extremists,

475
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,720
the protestors come from
a wide range of backgrounds,

476
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,080
united by a single argument.

477
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:49,000
The idea behind the act is so vicious
that every thinking human being,

478
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,280
everyone in this country will be
affected and therefore is standing up.

479
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,520
Hindu, Muslims, everybody are equal.
We want that equality.

480
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,600
I'm a Hindu
but I'm an Indian first.

481
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,360
When it comes to the values
of secularism given by the India,

482
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,520
when it comes to the ideas
of foundations of India,

483
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,840
then no matter what,
I should be in that...

484
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,680
I should preserve the constitutional
values, which is the utmost priority.

485
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,240
Exactly.
And that is genuinely inspiring.

486
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,880
When you see moments like that,

487
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,240
you begin to hope that Trump
might actually be right in a way

488
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,440
about the man
that he's about to visit,

489
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,680
just not in the exact way
that he thinks.

490
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,280
When he says that Modi
is bringing India together,

491
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,400
with any luck,
the thing that unites them

492
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,600
may end up being their disgust
over what he is trying to do.

493
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,760
India, home of this
enduring symbol of love,

494
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,040
deserves a lot more than this
temporary symbol of hate.

495
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,760
And now this.

496
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:55,040
Larry King Wants His Guests
To Know One Thing About Him.

497
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,480
- A food you can't stand ?
- Liver ?

498
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,800
- I hate eggs.
- You hate eggs ? No.

499
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,720
- I hate eggs.
- You hate eggs ?

500
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,120
I must have had a bad thing
when a kid. I can't even look at them.

501
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,960
- I hate eggs.
- Eggs can be tough.

502
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,040
I hate eggs for some reason.

503
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,640
I hate eggs.
I hate eggs and fish, I don't know why.

504
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,000
I didn't know this.

505
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,520
- I hate eggs. I don't...
- Do you hate eggs ?

506
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,680
I already told you
that I hate eggs. I hate eggs.

507
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,000
You hate eggs ?
I love eggs.

508
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,720
That's our show, thanks for watching.
See you next week. Goodnight !

509
