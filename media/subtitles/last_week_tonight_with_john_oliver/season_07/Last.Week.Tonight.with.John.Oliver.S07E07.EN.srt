00:00:13,384 --> 00:00:15,624
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:17,985
SEASON VII
EPISODE 7

3
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:24,066
Hello there ! And welcome to another
of these slightly strange shows.

4
00:00:24,186 --> 00:00:27,146
Thanks for joining me again
in my empty white void.

5
00:00:27,226 --> 00:00:29,786
For those who are wondering,
I chose this color myself

6
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:32,707
it's called "whale jizz"
and I think it's elegant,

7
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:38,628
and also a perfect wall for a vintage
piece of Pennsylvania rat erotica.

8
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:41,108
We may actually have
a lead on that painting.

9
00:00:41,188 --> 00:00:43,588
Watch this space
for some good news soon.

10
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:47,349
Anyway, it has obviously been
another long, difficult week.

11
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:49,909
The coronavirus
is still dominating the news.

12
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:52,590
We're all handling isolation
in different ways.

13
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,830
Jeremy Renner has decided
that now is the perfect time for him

14
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,871
to release his debut EP of songs,
titled "The Medicine".

15
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:02,111
Have I heard it ? No.

16
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:05,511
I haven't entered the "Let's Give Jeremy
Renner's Album an Honest Chance"

17
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:07,112
stage of self-quarantine yet,

18
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,592
and I hope that I don't get there,
because it sounds like this.

19
00:01:11,312 --> 00:01:14,113
I never said I was sorry.

20
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,753
I ain't sorry.

21
00:01:17,473 --> 00:01:19,273
Never sorry.

22
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,074
I hate this moment
in human history so much.

23
00:01:24,914 --> 00:01:26,995
This was also the week
that Donald Trump

24
00:01:27,115 --> 00:01:30,995
seemed to at least temporarily
acknowledge how dire this situation is.

25
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:33,475
He held a press conference
announcing that this virus

26
00:01:33,555 --> 00:01:37,356
could kill between
a hundred and 240,000 Americans

27
00:01:37,436 --> 00:01:39,756
quickly adding that,
had he done nothing,

28
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:43,237
there could've been over two million
deaths, and then saying this.

29
00:01:43,597 --> 00:01:48,678
If we can hold that down to 100,000,
it's a horrible number,

30
00:01:49,518 --> 00:01:52,118
maybe even less, but to 100,000;

31
00:01:52,318 --> 00:01:54,518
so we have
between 100 and 200,000

32
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:58,039
we all, together,
have done a very good job.

33
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:02,480
Okay, setting aside the fact
that leading disease forecasters

34
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,920
are mystified at how Trump
got to those figures,

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,800
trying to spin 200,000
deaths as a "good job",

36
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,201
because it's not millions,

37
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:14,041
is the most callous way to minimize
the deaths of Americans imaginable,

38
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:18,962
were it not for the fact that Trump
responded to 9/11-on 9/11

39
00:02:19,042 --> 00:02:20,802
by pointing out
that he used to own

40
00:02:20,882 --> 00:02:23,323
the second-tallest building
in downtown Manhattan,

41
00:02:23,403 --> 00:02:25,083
and now he owned the tallest.

42
00:02:25,363 --> 00:02:28,963
And the thing is, that wasn't
just offensive, it wasn't even true.

43
00:02:29,363 --> 00:02:30,524
#NeverForget,

44
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:33,724
#ThatOurPresident
IsAnIndescribableDick.

45
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:35,604
And for the record,

46
00:02:35,804 --> 00:02:39,645
deaths in the hundreds of thousands
were not inevitable here.

47
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:43,325
The federal response, under Trump,
has actively made things worse,

48
00:02:43,445 --> 00:02:45,726
particularly the botched
rollout of testing

49
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:49,486
that continues to undermine almost
every effort to contain this virus.

50
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:52,447
And yet,
Trump has repeatedly suggested

51
00:02:52,527 --> 00:02:54,967
that it's the states' responsibility
to fix things

52
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:58,608
an attitude which reached its apex
on Thursday, when Jared Kushner

53
00:02:58,768 --> 00:03:03,208
a man who looks less like someone
who could handle a global pandemic

54
00:03:03,328 --> 00:03:08,009
and more like an alt-right Pinocchio
suggested that states should not count

55
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:10,529
on a federal stockpile
of medical supplies.

56
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:13,850
The notion of the federal stockpile
was it's supposed to be our stockpile.

57
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,170
It's not supposed to be states'
stockpiles that they then use.

58
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,011
Wait. Our stockpile ?
It's not your stockpile.

59
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:25,291
It's a national stockpile for use by
the United States, you fucking moron.

60
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:27,612
And here's the interesting thing
about the United States:

61
00:03:27,732 --> 00:03:30,252
it's almost entirely made of states.

62
00:03:30,332 --> 00:03:33,853
There's states everywhere !
I'd say more than 40 of them, Jared !

63
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:36,813
And some parts of them badly
need supplies right now,

64
00:03:36,893 --> 00:03:38,733
like the city
that you used to live in,

65
00:03:38,813 --> 00:03:42,214
and in which I pray you never show
your polished fucking face again.

66
00:03:42,574 --> 00:03:45,454
So, with states being left to pick up
the federal government's slack,

67
00:03:45,574 --> 00:03:49,615
your fate may come down now
to how good your governor is.

68
00:03:49,735 --> 00:03:54,295
Some have done well-Gavin Newsom
in California and Mike DeWine in Ohio

69
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:57,136
both started canceling public events
in early March.

70
00:03:57,216 --> 00:04:01,456
Others, like Andrew Cuomo in New York,
have aggressively managed the crisis,

71
00:04:01,536 --> 00:04:03,377
although he has been dragging his feet

72
00:04:03,457 --> 00:04:06,537
on mitigating the spread within
New York's jails and prisons.

73
00:04:06,617 --> 00:04:10,098
Which is not ideal. Nor is the fact that
he wore a white polo shirt this week,

74
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:13,778
that forced us all to consider
whether or not he has nipple rings.

75
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:18,099
And if he does, at least he's handling
this public health crisis fairly well,

76
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:21,419
even as he handles
a midlife crisis very poorly.

77
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,100
But other governors
have been actively irresponsible.

78
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,020
Mounting pressure
on the governors

79
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,220
who have refused
to issue stay-at-home orders.

80
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,621
Georgia held out
until earlier this week,

81
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:34,061
the governor
insisting he only now learned

82
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,862
that people without symptoms
could spread the disease.

83
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:42,342
Finding out that this virus is now
transmitting before people see signs,

84
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:46,063
those persons could've been infecting
people before they ever felt bad,

85
00:04:46,183 --> 00:04:49,343
we didn't know that
until the last 24 hours.

86
00:04:49,983 --> 00:04:53,224
No, you didn't know that
until the last 24 hours.

87
00:04:53,384 --> 00:04:56,144
Most of the rest of us have
known that since February.

88
00:04:56,224 --> 00:05:00,905
That information, much like Covid-19,
has spread around a bit since then.

89
00:05:01,105 --> 00:05:03,385
But honestly,
the person I feel worst for there,

90
00:05:03,465 --> 00:05:06,466
other than every Georgian,
is Kemp's interpreter.

91
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:11,026
Because having to communicate harmful
nonsense is a waste of his talents.

92
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,027
This guy here is an artist.
You need proof ?

93
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:17,787
Here he is interpreting
a Beyoncé song at Atlanta Pride.

94
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:30,189
Slay, king !
Call me an asymptomatic carrier

95
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:33,510
because that performance
is living inside me right now.

96
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,150
And Kemp's isn't the worst
reasoning for inaction.

97
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,431
Alabama's governor Kay Ivey resisted
calls for statewide stay-at-home orders

98
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:45,391
until just a couple of days ago,
citing one simple truth.

99
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:48,432
We aren't California,
we are not New York.

100
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:53,752
I do not believe our economy
needs a full shelter-in-place order

101
00:05:54,193 --> 00:05:58,833
as some other states have done,
not at this time, hopefully not ever.

102
00:05:59,553 --> 00:06:03,674
Now, I'll give her this:
Alabama isn't California or New York.

103
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:07,034
It is, of course, Alabama,
a state whose flag says,

104
00:06:07,194 --> 00:06:10,995
"We're working on it," whose seal
says, "This is where Alabama is,"

105
00:06:11,195 --> 00:06:14,235
and whose "State Facts" page
on FiftyStates-dot-com

106
00:06:14,395 --> 00:06:17,636
is just, and this is true,
50 facts about Indiana.

107
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:19,196
Which is ridiculous,

108
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:22,957
because there are clearly lots
of interesting facts about Alabama.

109
00:06:23,037 --> 00:06:27,797
One is that it has a higher growth rate
in coronavirus cases than California.

110
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:30,638
Governor, maybe that graph
should be on your flag !

111
00:06:30,718 --> 00:06:32,158
Isn't learning fun ?

112
00:06:33,078 --> 00:06:37,479
But the worst gubernatorial response
has come from Florida's Ron DeSantis

113
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:41,959
what you'd get if a sexual harassment
allegation fucked a Toyota Camry.

114
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:46,120
Florida saw an explosion of cases
throughout the month of March,

115
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,361
which is especially alarming in a state
where 1 in 5 residents are over 65.

116
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:53,721
But DeSantis continued to suggest

117
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:57,442
he would only issue a statewide order
if the president told him to.

118
00:06:57,602 --> 00:07:01,282
So, it was often up to counties
to set their own policies,

119
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:02,962
which has some pretty
obvious shortcomings,

120
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:06,003
perhaps best summed up
by this photo of a Florida beach

121
00:07:06,123 --> 00:07:10,203
in which you can see the line between
one county that had closed its beaches,

122
00:07:10,283 --> 00:07:11,404
and one that hadn't.

123
00:07:11,524 --> 00:07:14,364
This may surprise you,
but drawing a line in the sand

124
00:07:14,444 --> 00:07:17,404
isn't actually
an effective public health strategy.

125
00:07:17,724 --> 00:07:21,005
And even when DeSantis finally
did the right thing this week,

126
00:07:21,165 --> 00:07:23,205
he still managed to fuck it up.

127
00:07:23,685 --> 00:07:26,966
In Florida, a stay-at-home order
going into effect today,

128
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,086
but only after
Governor Ron DeSantis

129
00:07:29,286 --> 00:07:31,766
offered an exception
for religious services.

130
00:07:31,846 --> 00:07:36,047
I don't think the government
has the authority to close a church.

131
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,927
That's even stupider than it sounds.

132
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:43,168
Because DeSantis not only exempted
churches from bans on large gatherings,

133
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:46,048
he also exempted them
from social distancing requirements,

134
00:07:46,128 --> 00:07:51,209
and made it impossible for localities
even in hot spots-to override him.

135
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:54,810
Which is clearly dangerous. You are
not protected from the coronavirus

136
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,730
just because you're in church.

137
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,410
We don't say,
"Bless you" after people sneeze

138
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,451
to thank God for catching the sneeze

139
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:04,771
and throwing it in germ jail
with all the other sneezes.

140
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:07,291
That's not a service God provides.

141
00:08:07,932 --> 00:08:12,452
The problem is, as a nation,
our success in containing Covid-19

142
00:08:12,612 --> 00:08:15,213
is only going to be as good
as our worst governor,

143
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:19,533
especially with the federal government
abdicating so much responsibility.

144
00:08:19,613 --> 00:08:21,934
That is what is so infuriating here.

145
00:08:22,014 --> 00:08:26,414
It is hard to think of a way to fully
express the quandary that we're in,

146
00:08:26,534 --> 00:08:30,375
but Jared Kushner may inadvertently
have summed it up the best.

147
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:32,455
What a lot of the voters
are seeing now

148
00:08:32,575 --> 00:08:35,295
is that when you elect somebody to be
a mayor or a governor or a president,

149
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:39,056
you're trying to think about who will be
a competent manager during a crisis.

150
00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:43,617
This is a crisis, you're seeing certain
people are better managers than others.

151
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:48,897
Yeah, no shit, Jared. Certain people
are better managers than others.

152
00:08:48,977 --> 00:08:51,538
And unfortunately,
it seems certain other people

153
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:53,738
are content to sit back
and watch the bad ones

154
00:08:53,818 --> 00:08:56,338
make decisions
that will cost people's lives,

155
00:08:56,418 --> 00:09:00,459
all in the hopes that Americans will
learn a valuable lesson while dying.

156
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:06,020
I know Jared Kushner must have
a stockpile of empathy somewhere,

157
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,300
but it appears
that that's his empathy

158
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,021
and he's not allowed
to extend it to anyone else.

159
00:09:11,741 --> 00:09:12,941
And now this !

160
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:16,501
And Now:
Are You Wearing Pants ?

161
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:21,662
We hang out at Ben's place, then
we go to Bernie's house for a while...

162
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:23,982
I'm wondering if either of them
are wearing pants.

163
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:27,263
- I do have a question for you.
- Yes ?

164
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:28,783
Are you wearing pants ?

165
00:09:28,863 --> 00:09:32,624
- Kim, what are you wearing ?
- Let's see.

166
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:33,904
I am wearing pants.

167
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:37,984
I have pants on today, yes.

168
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:42,745
Yes. Yes, yes. You're just gonna
have to take my word on that

169
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:44,585
'cause I'm not standing up.

170
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:46,986
The question is:
are you wearing pants ?

171
00:09:47,146 --> 00:09:48,986
Are you wearing pants ?

172
00:09:49,426 --> 00:09:50,546
Party on the bottom ?

173
00:09:50,826 --> 00:09:52,346
Are you wearing pants, Code ?

174
00:09:55,347 --> 00:09:56,547
I am not !

175
00:09:57,027 --> 00:09:59,307
I'm sort of down on this
social distancing right here.

176
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:04,468
I have a 30-second commute
into the office this morning.

177
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,068
Thank you, Steve.

178
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,469
Are you wearing pants ?

179
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:11,469
Becky, we don't have
to talk about that.

180
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:14,790
But let's be clear:
the whole suit doesn't have to go on.

181
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,190
Let's be clear.

182
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,950
Are they really tight ?
Getting tighter, Steve ?

183
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:27,471
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns the news media.

184
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:31,552
The people who announced to the world
that man had landed on the moon,

185
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:34,232
World War II had ended,
and who will one day

186
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:37,553
announce my tragic death
after a pelican swallows me whole.

187
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:40,953
I love corn dogs, the pier,
and taunting large birds.

188
00:10:41,113 --> 00:10:42,634
It's only a matter of time.

189
00:10:42,754 --> 00:10:46,034
Trump has made no secret
of his disdain for the media,

190
00:10:46,194 --> 00:10:48,834
but he's also been holding a lot
of press conferences recently,

191
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:49,995
which has highlighted the fact

192
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:54,235
there is one media outlet
he seems to really enjoy calling on.

193
00:10:54,475 --> 00:10:57,316
Okay. A couple of questions.
Go ahead, OAN ?

194
00:10:57,636 --> 00:11:01,316
We'll take a few questions.
Emerald, OAN ?

195
00:11:01,556 --> 00:11:02,916
OAN, please, OAN ?

196
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:05,397
OAN ?

197
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:06,917
Yes, sir.

198
00:11:06,997 --> 00:11:10,518
- Thank you. I have two questions.
- You treat me very nicely.

199
00:11:10,918 --> 00:11:15,438
Instinctively, you know that when
Trump likes something that much,

200
00:11:15,598 --> 00:11:17,158
it's an immediate red flag.

201
00:11:17,238 --> 00:11:19,799
Take this capybara
with an orange on its head.

202
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:23,519
It seems excellent,
but if Trump were to repeatedly say,

203
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,440
"I love that capybara
with an orange on its head,"

204
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,280
you know we're about to find out

205
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,560
all the times
that it wore blackface in college.

206
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,001
OAN stands for "One America News",

207
00:11:34,121 --> 00:11:36,641
and when you hear
the kinds of questions that they ask,

208
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:39,602
you begin to see
why Trump calls on them so much.

209
00:11:40,162 --> 00:11:43,402
Your approval ratings have been
the highest they've ever been,

210
00:11:43,562 --> 00:11:45,923
as well as the ratings
on your handling of the virus.

211
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,323
Yet, there are some networks
that are saying they're debating

212
00:11:48,563 --> 00:11:50,603
whether or not
to carry these briefings live.

213
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:52,604
Do you think
there's a link between the two ?

214
00:11:53,324 --> 00:11:57,884
I don't know.... Boy, a nice question !
Thank you very much.

215
00:11:58,644 --> 00:12:00,565
Was that a nice question, though ?

216
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:03,725
I guess it depends
on what your definition of one is.

217
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:08,366
If a nice question is meant to extract
any useful information at all,

218
00:12:08,446 --> 00:12:09,606
then it wasn't nice.

219
00:12:09,726 --> 00:12:13,126
If it's one that makes the president
feel happy for a brief instant

220
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:15,807
before that feeling,
like all feelings, is swallowed up

221
00:12:15,887 --> 00:12:18,167
by the unfathomable void
that yawns within him always,

222
00:12:18,247 --> 00:12:20,808
then yeah,
it was a very nice question !

223
00:12:21,688 --> 00:12:25,408
OAN has a lot of nice questions
for the president.

224
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:29,889
When he was criticized for referring to
the coronavirus as "the Chinese virus"

225
00:12:29,969 --> 00:12:33,249
one of their correspondents rushed
to his defense with this beauty.

226
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:36,770
Do you consider the term
"Chinese food" racist

227
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,650
because it's food that originates
in China or it has Chinese origins ?

228
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,571
I don't think it's racist at all.

229
00:12:43,651 --> 00:12:46,931
On that note, major left-wing
news media, even in this room,

230
00:12:47,011 --> 00:12:50,292
have teamed up with Chinese
Communist Party narratives

231
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:52,332
and they're claiming
you're a racist

232
00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:54,732
for making these claims
about "Chinese virus".

233
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:58,813
Is it alarming that major
media players just oppose you

234
00:12:58,893 --> 00:13:02,373
are consistently siding
with foreign state propaganda,

235
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:05,014
Islamic radicals,
and Latin gangs and cartels

236
00:13:05,214 --> 00:13:08,974
and they work at the White House with
direct access to you and your team ?

237
00:13:10,535 --> 00:13:14,455
It's pretty wild to watch the reactions
of the other journalists there,

238
00:13:14,575 --> 00:13:18,656
who are clearly not used to getting
bullshit from both sides of the room.

239
00:13:18,896 --> 00:13:20,216
That is a look that says,

240
00:13:20,696 --> 00:13:24,057
"How did I wind up in the middle
of this asshole sandwich ?"

241
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:29,457
It's moments like that that explain why
Trump has such a love affair with OAN.

242
00:13:29,777 --> 00:13:32,098
He has repeatedly praised them
on Twitter.

243
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,538
When he didn't like Shep Smith's
coverage of his administration,

244
00:13:35,618 --> 00:13:39,459
he tweeted that Shep Smith has
the lowest rated show on Fox News.

245
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:42,819
"Actually, whenever possible,
I turn to OAN !"

246
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:45,340
And his family seem like fans, too.

247
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,540
In the midst of a pandemic,
OAN spent nearly 15 minutes

248
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,661
chatting with Don Jr.,
resulting in this fantastic exchange.

249
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:57,461
Are you binge watching
anything over there ?

250
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,382
You gotta be
binge watching something.

251
00:13:59,462 --> 00:14:02,342
We basically watched
"Tiger King" in two sittings.

252
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:05,622
It's sort of amazing
and I'm just really disappointed

253
00:14:05,702 --> 00:14:08,103
that I didn't know you could get
a tiger for two grand.

254
00:14:08,263 --> 00:14:10,543
It's a lot of money
but like, it's a tiger.

255
00:14:10,663 --> 00:14:15,024
That would have been cool to have
had a tiger hanging around the house.

256
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:21,225
That should absolutely not be your
takeaway after watching that show !

257
00:14:21,585 --> 00:14:23,385
Tigers are surprisingly cheap.

258
00:14:23,505 --> 00:14:27,826
Also, it turns out you can also hire
a hitman for $3 000 ! What a deal !

259
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:31,906
OAN is a relatively
small organization

260
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:34,507
but you may well know someone
who watches them

261
00:14:34,587 --> 00:14:37,627
and they're punching way
above their weight right now.

262
00:14:37,827 --> 00:14:41,388
If they're in the White House press
room, being called on all the time

263
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:43,948
and are more supportive
of the president than Fox,

264
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:46,268
we thought tonight
it may be worth taking a look

265
00:14:46,348 --> 00:14:48,269
at who they are
and what they do.

266
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:51,389
OAN is the brainchild
of Robert Herring,

267
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:54,829
conservative millionaire
and sun-dried Jake Gyllenhaal.

268
00:14:55,109 --> 00:14:59,190
And since its birth, OAN has been
a home for extreme conservatism.

269
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,870
How extreme ?
Well, let's meet their hosts.

270
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,151
For starters, there's Graham Ledger,

271
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:07,431
who's called Black Lives Matter
a criminal organization,

272
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:10,232
he's called being transgender
a mental problem

273
00:15:10,312 --> 00:15:13,592
and said of people coming to the U.S.
from majority-Muslim countries,

274
00:15:13,672 --> 00:15:16,353
"if they won't take a bite out
of a pulled pork sandwich,"

275
00:15:16,513 --> 00:15:18,513
"we probably
won't let them in the country."

276
00:15:18,713 --> 00:15:20,673
It's wit like that that makes him

277
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,114
the Noël Coward of meat
sandwich-based race baiting.

278
00:15:24,594 --> 00:15:27,634
He starts every show
with his signature catchphrase:

279
00:15:27,714 --> 00:15:29,874
"The doors to the newsroom
are locked,"

280
00:15:29,954 --> 00:15:32,275
"and the p.c. police
are not getting in,"

281
00:15:32,355 --> 00:15:35,915
and if that wasn't sweaty enough,
he ends every show like this.

282
00:15:36,355 --> 00:15:39,476
"The Daily Ledger" is on its way
to the Archives Library of Congress.

283
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:41,476
Thank you for watching.
I'm Graham Ledger.

284
00:15:41,676 --> 00:15:44,797
And remember,
even when I'm wrong, I'm right.

285
00:15:45,037 --> 00:15:48,197
Yeah,
he signs off that way every night.

286
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:51,237
And for the record,
we asked the Library of Congress

287
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:55,078
whether "The Daily Ledger" is sent
to its archives, and they told us,

288
00:15:55,158 --> 00:15:58,599
and I quote: they "have no record
of 'The Daily Ledger' being submitted,"

289
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,439
"nor have we received the shows
as a collection."

290
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,840
Getting into the Library of Congress
isn't remotely impressive.

291
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You know what's in there ?
"Jersey Shore" is in there !

292
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,841
"MILF Chronicles 4: Busty Mansions"
is in there !

293
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:17,401
Even our show is in there !
This is our listing in their catalog.

294
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:20,602
What I'm saying is,
you wouldn't be keeping great company,

295
00:16:20,682 --> 00:16:23,082
even if you were in there,
which you're not.

296
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:25,882
Then, of course,
there's his catchphrase:

297
00:16:26,002 --> 00:16:28,203
"Even when I'm wrong,
I'm right."

298
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:31,883
Which is even stupider.
Why would you want to say something

299
00:16:31,963 --> 00:16:34,764
that implies that
you're both shamelessly partisan

300
00:16:34,844 --> 00:16:38,044
and wrong a not-insignificant
part of the time ?

301
00:16:38,284 --> 00:16:41,765
It'd make just as much sense
if his catchphrase was:

302
00:16:41,885 --> 00:16:46,605
"Remember, even after I have explosive
diarrhea, I'm still full of shit."

303
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:50,046
Why would you admit
either of those things ?

304
00:16:50,606 --> 00:16:52,246
But it might actually be good

305
00:16:52,326 --> 00:16:55,527
that Ledger specifies
his rightness-even-inwrongness,

306
00:16:55,607 --> 00:17:00,367
because he is wrong a lot, and always
with a certain Ron Burgundy flair.

307
00:17:00,527 --> 00:17:03,728
Watch as he tries to dismantle
Bernie Sanders' rhetoric.

308
00:17:04,128 --> 00:17:09,289
Unfettered capitalism is what
we should desire in this country.

309
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:13,689
Unfettered capitalism
is what made this country great

310
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:16,050
in the Industrial Revolution.

311
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,090
Carnegie and...

312
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:25,251
... the other men that built
this country in the late 1800s,

313
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:28,971
I'm blanking. JP Morgan !
The rest of them.

314
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:31,732
Rockefeller ! There's a name.

315
00:17:32,172 --> 00:17:35,772
Yeah, there is a name !
Nice save, Graham !

316
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:40,333
That's the kind of erudite historical
insight that you can find in his book:

317
00:17:40,413 --> 00:17:42,733
"The Industrial Revolution:
How Andrew Carnegie"

318
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:45,934
"and the Rest of Them,
JP Morgan, and others..."

319
00:17:46,014 --> 00:17:48,014
"The Monopoly Man, Maybe ?
That's a Name..."

320
00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:51,295
"Built America Through Unfettered
Capitalism. Shit, and Henry Ford !"

321
00:17:51,455 --> 00:17:54,215
But Ledger isn't
the network's only bright light.

322
00:17:54,295 --> 00:17:57,615
You already know Chanel Rion,
OAN's White House reporter,

323
00:17:57,735 --> 00:17:59,696
whose speciality seems to be

324
00:17:59,776 --> 00:18:03,536
asking the questions that
are on absolutely nobody's minds.

325
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:09,657
2 405 Americans have died from
coronavirus in the last 60 days.

326
00:18:10,137 --> 00:18:14,858
Meanwhile, you have 2 369 children
who are killed by their mothers

327
00:18:14,938 --> 00:18:17,778
through elective abortions
each day.

328
00:18:17,938 --> 00:18:21,459
That's 16-and-a-half-thousand
children killed every week.

329
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:26,140
Okay, that's obviously
a rhetorical bad faith argument,

330
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,060
but what the hell, let's engage.

331
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,100
There are thousands of abortions
and thousands of coronavirus deaths.

332
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:36,061
We can disagree on whether those
things are equivalent, they're not,

333
00:18:36,341 --> 00:18:40,021
but if only one of them is growing
exponentially every single day,

334
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:43,822
that should probably be the one that
we focus on right the fuck now.

335
00:18:44,062 --> 00:18:46,262
But, by all means,
come back to that question

336
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:49,903
once abortions become
involuntary and wildly contagious.

337
00:18:50,423 --> 00:18:53,703
When Chanel Rion isn't asking
nice questions

338
00:18:53,783 --> 00:18:56,584
in the White House press room,
she also claims to be

339
00:18:56,664 --> 00:18:59,104
the "best political illustrator
in the country"

340
00:18:59,184 --> 00:19:02,865
"for constitutional conservative
and anti-leftist causes",

341
00:19:02,945 --> 00:19:06,305
which, to be fair,
is a very low bar to clear,

342
00:19:06,385 --> 00:19:11,386
yet I'm not sure if this drawing of
Rachel Maddow as "Wretched Madcow"

343
00:19:11,506 --> 00:19:13,586
even manages to get over it.

344
00:19:14,226 --> 00:19:16,427
She also runs
a word of the day website

345
00:19:16,507 --> 00:19:19,467
called "Wordeby's:
A World of Fine Words",

346
00:19:19,547 --> 00:19:23,828
featuring artful tributes to floral
language like metanoia, orphic

347
00:19:23,908 --> 00:19:27,148
and backfeifengesicht,
which apparently means

348
00:19:27,228 --> 00:19:29,589
"a face badly in need
of a punching".

349
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:32,189
Her About page explains that:

350
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:34,949
"If we don't nurture
and grow our WORD REALMS,"

351
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:37,710
"we don't nurture and grow
our THOUGHT REALMS."

352
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,030
And it's hard to know how
to describe a sentence like that.

353
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,071
Thankfully, Wordeby's
has an entry on Fanfaronade,

354
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:46,271
which means
"empty self-promoting language".

355
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,191
That seems to hit the nail
right on the head.

356
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,191
This website is so handy !

357
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:54,312
Then, there is Liz Wheeler,
who's a big Trump favorite.

358
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:56,752
And she can develop an argument.

359
00:19:56,952 --> 00:19:59,753
Just watch as,
over the course of 54 seconds,

360
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,233
she spins
an aquarium's simple decision

361
00:20:02,313 --> 00:20:04,714
not to announce
the gender of a baby penguin

362
00:20:04,794 --> 00:20:07,034
into something very different.

363
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:12,355
We should ask: where does radical
leftist gender ideology lead ?

364
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,995
Do liberals want human children
to be genderless ?

365
00:20:16,475 --> 00:20:20,356
If so, why ?
Is this based on biology ?

366
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,796
And if not, then what ?

367
00:20:23,236 --> 00:20:26,757
What happens when human
children are raised genderless ?

368
00:20:27,277 --> 00:20:31,957
If gender is destroyed, doesn't that
destroy traditional gender roles ?

369
00:20:32,518 --> 00:20:34,438
And if gender roles are destroyed,

370
00:20:34,518 --> 00:20:37,158
doesn't that destroy
gendered relationships ?

371
00:20:37,758 --> 00:20:40,359
And if gendered relationships
are destroyed,

372
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:43,079
doesn't that destroy
traditional marriage ?

373
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,400
If traditional marriage is destroyed,
doesn't that destroy the family unit ?

374
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,720
And if people aren't dependent
on their families,

375
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,680
then who do they depend on ?

376
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,601
That's right, the government,

377
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:58,561
which is the goal
of liberals in the first place.

378
00:20:58,641 --> 00:21:01,082
Don't let transgender penguins
fool you.

379
00:21:02,682 --> 00:21:05,082
That argument is a walk.

380
00:21:05,362 --> 00:21:09,523
I assume that she uses that same
chain argument logic for everything.

381
00:21:09,683 --> 00:21:14,083
Ask yourself: why do radical leftists
want to expand health insurance ?

382
00:21:14,283 --> 00:21:18,564
Do liberals want everyone to have
health? And if everyone has health,

383
00:21:18,684 --> 00:21:20,764
doesn't that mean
no one will ever die ?

384
00:21:20,884 --> 00:21:24,045
And if no one ever dies, doesn't that
mean Hitler would still be alive ?

385
00:21:24,165 --> 00:21:27,205
And if Hitler is still alive, isn't
World War II still happening ?

386
00:21:27,325 --> 00:21:29,046
And if World War II
is still happening,

387
00:21:29,126 --> 00:21:31,846
doesn't that mean
our troops are still fighting ?

388
00:21:31,966 --> 00:21:34,606
And if our troops are still
busy fighting in World War II,

389
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,007
who's defending America
from terrorists ?

390
00:21:37,127 --> 00:21:40,327
That's right, no one, which is the goal
of liberals in the first place.

391
00:21:40,447 --> 00:21:42,808
Don't let polyamorous
lobsters fool you.

392
00:21:43,528 --> 00:21:46,768
It's not just hard-right
talking points,

393
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:50,729
the network has actively given
airtime to conspiracy theories.

394
00:21:50,969 --> 00:21:54,929
They put up a $100 000 reward for
information on Seth Rich's murder,

395
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:58,250
last year they traveled
with Rudy Giuliani to Ukraine

396
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,370
to shoot a multi-part series featuring
his investigations there,

397
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,811
and recently,
Chanel Rion hosted a special

398
00:22:05,931 --> 00:22:08,371
in which she boosted
a conspiracy theory

399
00:22:08,451 --> 00:22:11,892
that the coronavirus might have
originated as a bioweapon

400
00:22:11,972 --> 00:22:14,172
in a North Carolina laboratory.

401
00:22:14,572 --> 00:22:16,812
The whole selling point for OAN

402
00:22:16,892 --> 00:22:22,173
is that they are Fox News with even
less shame and even fewer scruples.

403
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:25,054
In fact, they're so flagrantly
smitten with Trump

404
00:22:25,174 --> 00:22:28,174
that at one point, their network
account actually tweeted:

405
00:22:28,254 --> 00:22:32,255
"President Trump gave a speech,
thanking his supporters in the media."

406
00:22:32,335 --> 00:22:34,655
"Not a single mention
of One America News"

407
00:22:34,735 --> 00:22:36,815
"one of his greatest supporters..."

408
00:22:36,895 --> 00:22:38,575
"OAN calls bullshit."

409
00:22:39,176 --> 00:22:42,536
And that is just pathetically thirsty.

410
00:22:42,976 --> 00:22:46,137
They shift from fawning
praise to sullen fury

411
00:22:46,217 --> 00:22:49,257
if people stop complimenting them
for a single second.

412
00:22:49,337 --> 00:22:51,617
When you put it like that,
you do kind of get

413
00:22:51,697 --> 00:22:54,058
what OAN and the president
see in each other.

414
00:22:54,138 --> 00:22:58,658
I know that it is easy to dismiss OAN
as just a stupid,

415
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:01,459
little-watched,
borderline self-parody.

416
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:04,979
The problem is, if we're learning
one thing right now,

417
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:09,260
it's that toxic things that start small
can get big fast

418
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,300
and it's dangerous
to ignore them.

419
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,621
The president's putting a lot
of energy into boosting OAN's profile.

420
00:23:16,741 --> 00:23:18,541
For instance, last week,

421
00:23:18,661 --> 00:23:22,502
even as the number of confirmed
coronavirus cases in the U.S.

422
00:23:22,622 --> 00:23:26,022
passed 65 000,
Trump thought it was important

423
00:23:26,182 --> 00:23:28,663
that his Twitter followers
see this video.

424
00:23:29,223 --> 00:23:35,664
Guess what ? Thanks to you guys,
this book, my book, is number four

425
00:23:35,824 --> 00:23:39,984
on Amazon's bestseller list
in the political commentary category.

426
00:23:40,064 --> 00:23:42,665
Thank you, thank you so much.

427
00:23:42,865 --> 00:23:45,345
Yeah, he retweeted that
with the note:

428
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:48,545
"Buy the book and give Liz
some Great Reviews !"

429
00:23:48,825 --> 00:23:50,826
Which would
absolutely be weird enough

430
00:23:50,906 --> 00:23:55,106
even if Liz Wheeler hadn't posted
that video last August.

431
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:59,067
And we all know the rules here,
liking someone's post is fine.

432
00:23:59,227 --> 00:24:01,947
Liking someone's post
from seven months ago

433
00:24:02,227 --> 00:24:04,348
is the creepiest thing on earth.

434
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:07,028
Trump has had
their back in other ways.

435
00:24:07,108 --> 00:24:09,828
Just this week, the White House
Correspondents' Association

436
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,949
revoked OAN's access
to a seat in the briefings.

437
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:15,869
The reason they did this
was because most reporters

438
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:19,310
had agreed to take turns
attending to keep the room emptier

439
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,470
and follow social distancing rules.

440
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:26,031
But Chanel Rion repeatedly showed up
on days she wasn't assigned a seat.

441
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:29,031
Yet despite having her seat
revoked on Wednesday,

442
00:24:29,231 --> 00:24:32,192
Rion was back in that room
the very next day,

443
00:24:32,312 --> 00:24:34,752
telling people that she'd been
personally invited

444
00:24:34,832 --> 00:24:36,952
as a guest
of the White House press secretary.

445
00:24:37,072 --> 00:24:40,713
And that is a problem.
Because in the best of times,

446
00:24:40,873 --> 00:24:44,513
you can laugh at an almost
"Anchorman"-esque parody

447
00:24:44,593 --> 00:24:45,834
of right-wing news.

448
00:24:46,114 --> 00:24:48,634
But much like the problem
with "Anchorman 2",

449
00:24:48,714 --> 00:24:52,034
it's just not the right time
for Ron Burgundy right now.

450
00:24:52,555 --> 00:24:56,355
OAN's weird combination
of far right-wing talking points

451
00:24:56,435 --> 00:25:00,676
and dirt-stupid reporting
is dangerous at a time like this.

452
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:04,116
Graham Ledger has explicitly
called for Americans

453
00:25:04,196 --> 00:25:07,477
to defy the government's
advice on social distancing

454
00:25:07,597 --> 00:25:10,037
and has justified
his argument like this.

455
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:13,718
I would rather die of coronavirus
a free person

456
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:17,518
than live like a slave
to government engulfed in fear,

457
00:25:17,798 --> 00:25:19,758
panic and with no liberty.

458
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:25,159
"The Daily Ledger" is on its way
to the Archives Library of Congress.

459
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:27,399
Thank you for watching.
I'm Graham Ledger.

460
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:30,000
And remember, even when
I'm wrong, I'm right.

461
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,240
Honestly, as monumentally dumb
as that catchphrase is,

462
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:37,441
it still might be too smart
for Graham Ledger.

463
00:25:37,761 --> 00:25:40,641
He deserves a catchphrase more
on his intellectual level,

464
00:25:40,721 --> 00:25:41,802
maybe something like:

465
00:25:41,882 --> 00:25:45,722
"I'm Graham Ledger. And remember,
anything can be food if you eat it."

466
00:25:46,122 --> 00:25:50,043
Incidentally, that is just the tame,
TV version of Graham Ledger.

467
00:25:50,203 --> 00:25:54,763
Online, he's even worse. Watch
a video that he posted on Tuesday

468
00:25:54,843 --> 00:25:58,444
in which he claimed that it was
important that he get his hair cut

469
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:01,684
and framed it as a brave act
of civil disobedience.

470
00:26:02,324 --> 00:26:05,765
You know what we have to do
because we're living under an edict

471
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:10,126
not unlike Hitler's Germany
or Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union,

472
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:13,366
we're living under tyranny
instead of liberty ?

473
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:17,727
We have to do this
in clandestine style.

474
00:26:18,647 --> 00:26:23,327
My hairdresser could be fined and
or arrested for what she's doing.

475
00:26:24,688 --> 00:26:26,568
This is not unlike, of course,

476
00:26:26,728 --> 00:26:29,448
what they had to live through
during Hitler's time.

477
00:26:29,768 --> 00:26:31,409
Okay, a couple things there.

478
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:34,649
First of all, it's not essential
that you get your hair cut.

479
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:37,889
People on TV don't always
look well-groomed. Trust me.

480
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,370
Trust me. Look at me !
Trust me.

481
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,690
Second,
Hitler didn't outlaw haircuts.

482
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:47,971
He was a fascist about personal
grooming, other stuff too,

483
00:26:48,091 --> 00:26:49,211
but mainly that.

484
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:52,692
And third, if we were living
under a Nazi occupation,

485
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:56,772
maybe don't film yourself en route
to your secret resistance salon,

486
00:26:56,892 --> 00:27:00,013
which it took literally five minutes
on Google to figure out

487
00:27:00,093 --> 00:27:03,533
is presumably somewhere around
the Moonlight Plaza Shopping Center

488
00:27:03,613 --> 00:27:05,173
in Encinitas, California.

489
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:10,414
The problem here is, the kind
of misinformation OAN is spewing

490
00:27:10,494 --> 00:27:12,974
could end up
getting people killed.

491
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:17,455
Sadly, their message is being
actively spread by the White House.

492
00:27:17,655 --> 00:27:21,896
So, it is more important than ever
to be on the lookout for OAN's bullshit

493
00:27:21,976 --> 00:27:25,816
and to make sure no one that
you know is falling for it either.

494
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:29,777
I know that just calling it "bullshit"
may seem crude,

495
00:27:29,937 --> 00:27:33,977
so for all of those of you who might
desire a more eloquent plea,

496
00:27:34,178 --> 00:27:37,738
let me offer some language from
Rion's website, Wordeby's.

497
00:27:39,178 --> 00:27:44,099
In this vespertine hour, I implore you
to ignore a news network

498
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:47,339
that attempts to gloze this
administration's ineptitude

499
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:50,740
during a pandemic, whether it be
a sciolist like Liz Wheeler,

500
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,500
a backfeifengesicht
like Graham Ledger

501
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,941
or a rakefire like Chanel Rion.

502
00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:59,701
For these people
are not just irresponsible, my friends,

503
00:27:59,781 --> 00:28:02,502
they're a bunch
of fucking fopdoodles.

504
00:28:03,262 --> 00:28:05,862
That is our show.
Thank you so much for watching.

505
00:28:05,942 --> 00:28:08,142
We will see you next week.
I'm John Oliver

506
00:28:08,262 --> 00:28:10,463
and this edition is,
for some reason,

507
00:28:10,543 --> 00:28:12,663
on its way
to the Library of Congress.

508
00:28:12,823 --> 00:28:15,823
Don't let bi-curious manatees
fool you, goodnight !

509
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:22,944
Okay.
And that feels like a show.

510
00:28:23,545 --> 00:28:25,745
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

511
00:28:25,825 --> 00:28:27,865
END OF EPISODE 7,
SEASON VII
