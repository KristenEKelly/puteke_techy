00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,680
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,200
SEASON VII
EPISODE 12

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,280
Hi there!
And welcome to the show.

4
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,840
Still taking place
in this weird blank void.

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,240
Weird for you, not for me.

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,800
Speedreading sad facts
alone to absolute silence is, perhaps,

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,000
the only time I've ever
felt truly comfortable.

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,360
It's been another long,
strange week

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,600
with the world struggling to deal
with the coronavirus.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,160
Some have been chafing
at stay-at-home orders

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,200
and not just here,
but also abroad.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,880
Take a look at these pictures
from Peru.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,360
Now, these are street performers
in the south of the country

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,080
who were arrested
for flouting lockdown rules.

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,720
More than 20 of them in all. They were
taken to a local police station

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,120
after being caught
holding a Mother's Day parade.

17
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,640
Okay, first: what the fuck
is Mother's Day like in Peru

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,560
and why isn't it like that here?

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,760
Second:
you have got to admire the people

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,840
who kept the heads of their costumes
on while being arrested.

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,800
That's some serious commitment
to staying in character!

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,160
Whoever's inside of that costume

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,600
is truly the Daniel Day-Lewis
of Peruvian Tweety Birds.

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,920
Meanwhile,
here in the United States,

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,560
this week saw Congress hear
testimony from Rick Bright,

26
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,120
ousted top vaccine official
turned whistleblower,

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,560
who described missed opportunities,
such as this moment in January,

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,680
when a manufacturer
of PPE tried to sound an alarm.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,160
I'll never forget the emails
I received from Mike Bowen

30
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,920
indicating that our mask supplier,
N95 respirator supplier,

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,800
was completely decimated.

32
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,040
And he said: "We're in deep shit.
The world is. And we need to act."

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,920
Yeah. It seems that's what
congressional testimony is now,

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,160
just career public health officials
saying, on the record:

35
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,160
"Shit's fucked, motherfuckers!"

36
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,920
It feels like, as time goes on,
we're about to find out

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,520
more clear warning signs that
the Trump administration ignored.

38
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,080
I'm assuming we'll learn that Trump
was delivered a report in January

39
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,040
titled "What to Expect When
You're Expecting the Coronavirus"

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,440
"to Kill 80 000 Americans
in Four Months."

41
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,560
While you would expect the president
to be laser-focused on this pandemic

42
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,040
and nothing else,
he took a break on Friday

43
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,640
to unveil the new Space Force flag
and do a little bragging.

44
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,400
The president was touting
other potential advances

45
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,320
like a new high-speed missile
for Mr. Trump's pet project,

46
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,520
the Space Force.

47
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,000
I call it the super duper missile.
Space is going to be the future.

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,440
We're now the leader in space.

49
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,200
Yeah, that happened.

50
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,360
Donald Trump posed
with a gigantic Space Force flag

51
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,240
while standing
way too close to someone,

52
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,120
referred to
a "super duper missile"

53
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,520
and called the U.S.
"the leader in space".

54
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,640
He truly has the spirit, brain,
appetite, temper, patience

55
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,800
and wit of a child that you hate.

56
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,680
There's also been a major scandal
brewing in Washington,

57
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,240
surrounding North Carolina senator

58
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,960
and chair of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, Richard Burr.

59
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,360
It kicked up a notch on Wednesday
with a startling development.

60
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,760
Law enforcement officials say
the FBI served a search warrant

61
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,760
Wednesday night
at Senator Burr's home.

62
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,480
They say
it was part of an investigation

63
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,080
into stock sales
related to the coronavirus.

64
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,360
The officials say Burr handed over
a cell phone to the agents at his home.

65
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,040
It's true. The FBI seized
Burr's cell phone on suspicion

66
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,040
that he may've used non-public
information from coronavirus briefings

67
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,320
to dump shares ahead
of the market crash.

68
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,080
Which, among other things,
is a reminder that at any moment,

69
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,320
the FBI could barge into your house
and confiscate your phone.

70
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,480
If the photo
on your phone's home screen

71
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,400
is something
you don't want the FBI to see,

72
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,720
like, I don't know, a very tasteful
image of a hamster in a speedo,

73
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,400
you should change it immediately.

74
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,096
Now, there's nothing illegal about
that particular example, by the way.

75
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,840
That's just something
I randomly thought of.

76
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,080
On a completely unrelated note,
I have to do something real quick.

77
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,400
And bye-bye, buddy.
Good. Okay, back to Richard Burr.

78
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,440
The details here do not look
particularly good for him.

79
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,240
Before the market tumbled,

80
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,960
Burr and other members of the Senate
were told in a February briefing

81
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,920
about the potential impact
of the crisis to come.

82
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,400
A day after,
Burr sold up to $1.7 million in stock,

83
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,000
including shares
in the travel and hotel industry.

84
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,120
That is pretty damning.

85
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,280
The only way that could have been
any shadier

86
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,080
is if Burr then bought a ton of shares
in the actual coronavirus.

87
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,440
Burr staunchly maintains
that he did nothing wrong here,

88
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,160
basing his sales solely
on news reports at the time.

89
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,800
And you know what?
Sure.

90
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,080
But there are things in Burr's past
that are inherently suspicious.

91
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,480
For one thing: there was
his position on the Stock Act,

92
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,840
which forbids members of Congress
from trading on nonpublic information

93
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,080
that they learn on the job.

94
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,120
Burr was one of only three senators
to vote against that legislation.

95
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,040
In terms of outright character flaws,

96
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,080
there's also the fact that apparently,
he never wears socks.

97
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,440
Which is not just completely
unacceptable,

98
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,040
it seems like it's something
he's actively proud of.

99
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,360
What is your position on socks?

100
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,560
I'm not opposed. We've manufactured
a lot of socks in North Carolina.

101
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,320
I just choose not to wear 'em.

102
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,280
It's a southern thing,
it's a cultural thing.

103
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,000
What? Going foot-commando
is not a southern cultural thing.

104
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,960
Just because you choose to do
something and you're from the south,

105
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,920
does not mean
everyone there does it.

106
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,240
Not wearing socks
isn't a southern thing

107
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,840
any more than wearing socks
on your penis is a West Coast thing.

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,120
No, it's very particularly
a Red Hot Chili Peppers thing.

109
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,960
So, it seems Burr
has found himself in a situation

110
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,120
that's not unlike that
of the federal government.

111
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,680
He got information about
the coronavirus early,

112
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,920
there are lots of questions
about what he did with it,

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,480
and now he is,
if I may quote the testimony

114
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,920
of a very tired public health official,
"in deep shit".

115
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,520
And now this.

116
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,280
And Now:

117
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,920
Rachael Ray Is Doing Her Best With
Her New, One-Man Production Crew.

118
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,240
My husband, John Cusimano.
Wave, honey.

119
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,880
John is our cameraman and director.
It's gonna go straight to his head.

120
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,200
What's this thing

121
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,000
when you go to the Greek restaurant
and they set the cheese on fire?

122
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,800
Haloumi. Yeah.
Well, we're not doing that.

123
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,520
You could also
make it with flank steak.

124
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,560
Literally, she was pounding
out steak for, like, two hours.

125
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,240
- Why are you scaring people?
- It's nothing to be scared of.

126
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,400
- It's the beginning of the show...
- Sorry, everybody.

127
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,840
Don't be so impatient.

128
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,640
Wait, we gotta keep' em
back here in the frame.

129
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,280
Excuse me, Scorsese.

130
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Here's our chicken.
Did you see that?

131
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,040
You missed the big reveal, John.

132
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,160
Worcestershire sauce is actually
made from oysters, right?

133
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,560
As advertised, John.

134
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,520
You gotta get out of my way, dude.
I can't reach any of my tools.

135
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,960
- What are you doing?
- I'm making a mess!

136
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,360
It's like a squirrel came in
to make this cocktail.

137
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,240
Don't burn your thumb this time.

138
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,920
Anyway. Moving along, you're
always full of happy memories.

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,200
Date night.
This is so fun, right?

140
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,280
Like,
it's supposed to look dirty?

141
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,840
Let me finish it, please.

142
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,840
This is why I try not to pick
a fight with Rachael.

143
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,160
Moving on. Our main story
concerns sports,

144
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,720
the thing O.J. Simpson
used to be famous for.

145
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,200
The coronavirus has taken its toll
on all manner of industries,

146
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,200
but the world of sports was
among those hit hardest, earliest

147
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,800
and perhaps most visibly.

148
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,280
Think back to the day
that you first realized

149
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,520
our lives were gonna
fundamentally change for a while.

150
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,640
For many,
it was when this happened.

151
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,640
Two days before he tested
positive for coronavirus,

152
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,920
Utah Jazz all-star Rudy Gobert

153
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,280
did this to reporters' microphones
in an interview.

154
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,640
And this morning, the NBA
suspending the rest of its season.

155
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,760
The unprecedented move
shocking everyone,

156
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,160
including Dallas Mavs
owner Mark Cuban.

157
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,840
Think about how astonishing something
has to be to shock Mark Cuban.

158
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,880
Keep in mind, he's one
of the sharks on "Shark Tank"!

159
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,880
He's been pitched businesses
like "Rent A Goat",

160
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,720
a service that rents out goats
to eat overgrown shrubs,

161
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,120
"Squirrel Boss," a bird feeder that
gives electric shocks to squirrels

162
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,840
and "Elephant Chat", a stuffed elephant
that you put in the room

163
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,520
to signal there's something
uncomfortable to talk about.

164
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,320
Mark Cuban has already seen

165
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,200
the most jawdropping, inconceivable
things this world has to offer.

166
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,680
And it wasn't just basketball
vanishing suddenly.

167
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,360
Since then, the NHL
has suspended its season,

168
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,520
Major League Baseball pushed back
its opening day to an unknown date,

169
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,680
international soccer leagues
suspended games

170
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,680
and the Olympics were
moved to next summer.

171
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,400
As shocking as these cancellations
seemed at the time,

172
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,800
the truth is,
there was really no choice.

173
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,480
Sporting events with large crowds
packed together

174
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,040
are the exact opposite
of social distancing

175
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,880
and they're a nightmare scenario
during a pandemic.

176
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,880
This Champions League match
in Milan in February

177
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,480
was later likened
to a "biological bomb"

178
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,040
after it was linked
to one of the deadliest outbreaks.

179
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,840
But though sports shutting down
was emphatically the right thing to do,

180
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,760
people have increasingly been
asking when they can return.

181
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,120
And few have asked louder
than this guy.

182
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,960
I hope football can start.

183
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,440
And I told them:
"I think you might be able to."

184
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,120
They may very well be able to.
Hope they can start

185
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,280
and I hope they can start
with people in the stands.

186
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,160
The fans want to be back, too.

187
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,120
They want to see basketball and
baseball and football and hockey.

188
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,760
They want to see their sports.
We have to get our sports back.

189
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,640
I'm tired of watching baseball games
that are 14 years old.

190
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,640
But I haven't actually had
too much time to watch.

191
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,320
I would say maybe I watch one batter
and then I get back to work.

192
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,240
Okay, but here's the thing:
we asked some experts about that,

193
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,320
it turns out that when the country's
in the middle of a pandemic

194
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,920
that's killing many thousands
of Americans every single week,

195
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,600
the correct number of batters from
2006 for the president to be watching

196
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,560
is actually fucking zero.

197
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,680
But look,
he's not entirely wrong there.

198
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,800
The lack of sports is an emotional blow
to a lot of people.

199
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,280
And it's not just emotional,
it's also financial.

200
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,440
By one estimate, the sudden
disappearance of sports will erase

201
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,880
at least $12 billion in revenues

202
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,320
and hundreds of thousands of jobs
in this country alone.

203
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,760
Those jobs aren't just the high-paid
athletes playing the games,

204
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,600
they include the many people who count
on sporting events for employment,

205
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,200
like these two Philadelphia
stadium workers.

206
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,320
Marvin Spratley made $14 an hour
as a part-time grill cook

207
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,720
for nearly two years at Sixers,
Flyers and Eagles games.

208
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,320
It's a lot of stress on me. I got
bills piling up, baby needs Pampers.

209
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,480
Aisha Johnson is a maintenance
worker at Phillies games.

210
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,760
I have food on the table now.
I'm making it right at this moment

211
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,240
but I don't know
what tomorrow may bring.

212
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,760
Yeah, that's really difficult.
And it's worth remembering that

213
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,720
although Philadelphia sports fans
are a horde of inhuman monsters

214
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,616
who deserve neither sympathy
nor understanding,

215
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,760
the people paid to tend
to those monsters

216
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,040
depend on their monster money.

217
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,280
Given that the absence of sport
has caused such pain,

218
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,080
we thought tonight we'd take a look
at what sports have become

219
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,080
in the age of coronavirus and what
a path back for them might look like.

220
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,800
The sports world has been doing some
great things during this pandemic.

221
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,000
Teams and athletes have been donating
and raising money for charity,

222
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,200
with some even selling branded face
masks for coronavirus-related causes.

223
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,040
Despite not being able to play,
teams have found ways

224
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,280
to stay engaged with their fans online,
while modeling social distancing.

225
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,960
The Pittsburgh Pirates Parrot posted
an at-home workout video,

226
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,920
the Chicago Blackhawks mascot,
Tommy Hawk, vacuumed his apartment

227
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,960
and Gritty once again blew them
all away without even trying.

228
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,560
I don't know
what's more amazing there,

229
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,000
Gritty's incredible
hand-eye coordination,

230
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,720
the fact he seems to live
in an entirely empty apartment,

231
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,600
or the discovery that his body
occasionally squeaks when it moves,

232
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,960
presumably because,
evolutionarily speaking,

233
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,920
Gritty's closest relative
is a used dog toy.

234
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,760
And it's not just mascots,

235
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,880
athletes have been showing
how they're trying to work from home,

236
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,680
which has not always been
easy for them.

237
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,040
Reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo
told reporters last month

238
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,160
that he's been unable to practice,
he doesn't have a hoop at his house.

239
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,360
Others have had to get pretty creative
to continue their training:

240
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,600
an Olympic swimmer training
in a kiddie pool with a bungee cord,

241
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,560
an Olympic runner creating makeshift
treadmills in a bathtub with Palmolive,

242
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,720
an Olympic rock climber
using her home as a climbing gym,

243
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,480
or Branden Kline of the Orioles
squatting his dog,

244
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,160
who seems utterly delighted
by the situation.

245
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,440
But not every at-home
training session goes smoothly,

246
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,320
as Dodgers pitcher
Joe Kelly recently discovered.

247
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,080
Wondering how quarantine's going?
Joe is working on a change-up.

248
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,400
Yeah.

249
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,720
Honestly, if I was Joey Kelly's wife,
I'd never get that window fixed,

250
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,120
I'd make him explain what happened
every time someone came over.

251
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,040
"That window? Joe, do you
want to tell that story?"

252
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,600
I kind of forget some of the details,
like how many millions of dollars

253
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,440
you've been paid for your ability
to throw a baseball accurately,

254
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,520
how big the net was, and how
many feet you missed it by.

255
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,880
Go ahead and tell the story
while I pull up the video.

256
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,440
As for broadcasters
who are reliant on live events,

257
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,920
they are now
in a truly desperate situation.

258
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,160
While EPSN moved up their 10-part
Michael Jordan documentary,

259
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,320
they've otherwise
been strapped for content,

260
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,440
airing video game versions
of baseball and basketball,

261
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,840
with SportsCenter at one point
actually tweeting out this.

262
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,600
Now, you might be wondering:
"What the fuck did I just see?"

263
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,400
Apparently, that came from
a Russian show called "Stone Faces",

264
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,400
where contestants slap each other
as hard as they can.

265
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,360
And this particular guy is a renowned
competitive slapper

266
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,560
whose real name doesn't matter
because his nickname is "Dumpling",

267
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,600
which is just an outstanding name
for that man.

268
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,920
And at this point,
I don't need to know anything else,

269
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,040
I'm all in
on competitive slapping.

270
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,160
Tell me what channel to subscribe to
in order to watch it

271
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,400
and where to order
my Dumpling jersey.

272
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,840
If we are all reaching
the point of desperation

273
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,440
where we're honestly willing

274
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,560
to watch large men slap each other
in a windowless room,

275
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,840
there is clearly a desire
to restart sporting events.

276
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,840
The question, though, isn't
why sports should come back,

277
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,960
it's how that can safely happen.

278
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,160
To do it responsibly would be
a mammoth undertaking.

279
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,800
To do it irresponsibly, however,
turns out to be pretty easy.

280
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,280
The state of Florida, early on,
designated professional sports

281
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,800
and media production with a national
audience as an essential service,

282
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,400
so long as it's closed
to the general public.

283
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,920
The WWE has continued staging shows
in Florida,

284
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,280
holding matches
in front of empty chairs.

285
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,440
But, that requires a lot more people
than just those two wrestlers.

286
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,960
You need production crews
working together in close proximity.

287
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,640
While the WWE maintains

288
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,880
its safety measures are
as comprehensive as they can be,

289
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,320
one employee wrote an anonymous
letter to a Florida county commissioner

290
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,000
asking them to shut the tapings
down, because:

291
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,000
"Despite sanitary precautions,
we cannot maintain social distancing"

292
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,000
"and have to touch other people."

293
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,920
It's easy to see why CEO McMahon
doesn't mind them taking that risk,

294
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,520
as he told investors
on a recent earnings call,

295
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,560
viewers want to see new matches.

296
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,480
I think new content is always a driver
in terms of stimulating interest

297
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,880
and obviously everyone is pretty
much starved for new content.

298
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,440
It could very well be that
you're tired of watching Netflix

299
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,320
and you want to see strong men
running around in their underwear.

300
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,720
I would argue that the risks of
creating content the way that you are

301
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,040
seem to outweigh
the benefits right now.

302
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,160
No one on that call registered
your point there,

303
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,480
because you just said "stimulating",
"strong men", "underwear"

304
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,520
and, crucially "driver",
all in the same sentence.

305
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,800
At which point, everyone's minds
turned immediately

306
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,800
to getting absolutely bone-crushed
by Adam Driver.

307
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,840
Chokeslam me to hell,
you nasty shed.

308
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,120
Jam your mandible claw down
my throat, you irredeemable steer.

309
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,400
Quick side note here:

310
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,120
a lot of you might well be wondering
where I'm going with this bit.

311
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,336
If you're anything like my staff,
you're asking questions like:

312
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
"Is this sexual or is it violent?"

313
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,640
And you're then unsatisfied when
the answer comes back: "Yes".

314
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,040
If you're like my wife, you might be
asking: "Should I be worried",

315
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,480
with concern growing when the answer
is: "Only if you want to be."

316
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,280
What of Adam Driver himself?

317
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,840
Is he bothered
by this continued sexualization?

318
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,480
He seems a fairly private guy who's
generally uncomfortable with attention,

319
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,160
making what I'm doing
possibly some form of harassment.

320
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,960
He might actually have pretty good
grounds to have me reprimanded legally,

321
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,000
to which I say, do it.

322
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,080
Slap a restraining order on me,
you forlorn block.

323
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,480
Beg me to stop,
you menacing obstacle.

324
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,600
And it's not just the WWE.

325
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,080
Their competitor,
AEW, is also taping shows in Florida.

326
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,120
And the UFC just last week started
hosting matches in Jacksonville.

327
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,240
While they couldn't fly in
international fighters for that event,

328
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,320
their president, Dana White,
has devised an insane workaround.

329
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,760
Fight Island is real.
Fight Island is a real thing.

330
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,880
It's happening. The infrastructure
is being built right now on the island.

331
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm ready to go.

332
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,520
Yes, the UFC is apparently building
a facility on a private island

333
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,680
that they're calling "Fight Island".

334
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,960
Is that a clever name? No.
Is it the perfect name? Yes.

335
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,560
It's the first thought
an idiot would have

336
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,320
if they wanted to name
a private island where fights happen.

337
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,680
He could have called it Brawlhamas,
or Puerto Ruckus,

338
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,240
or Owie Maui, or Slam Miguel.

339
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,840
But he didn't.
He didn't do that.

340
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,480
He didn't go with the obvious name for
an island where you stage UFC fights,

341
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,200
which is simply, UF-Sea.

342
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,080
Look at me, Dana.
Why didn't you just call it UF-Sea?

343
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,680
It's perfect.

344
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,560
But clearly, staging events
is risky at the moment.

345
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,280
Just the day before
last weekend's UFC event,

346
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,080
a fighter had to pull out after he and
two of his cornermen tested positive,

347
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,920
underscoring the fact that if you want
to come back completely without risk,

348
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,360
that's just not possible right now.

349
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,680
Yet, many sports organizations are
feeling pressure to ignore that risk

350
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,200
especially college sports, where some
schools' athletic programs rely heavily

351
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,560
on revenue from football.

352
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,640
While you would hope
that coaches would talk

353
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,480
about the tradeoffs of risk
and safety with some tact,

354
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,520
Oklahoma State football coach
Mike Gundy seemed comfortable

355
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,200
saying the quiet parts loud.

356
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,360
In my opinion, if we have to bring
our players back, test them,

357
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,560
they're in good shape, they're all 18,
19, 20, 21, 22-years-old, healthy.

358
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,800
A lot of them can fight it off with it
with their natural body,

359
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,200
the antibodies
and build that they have.

360
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,240
We need to continue to budget and run
money through the state of Oklahoma.

361
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,640
Jesus Christ.
I don't know whose medical advice

362
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,280
is worth the least
in the middle of a pandemic,

363
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,400
but "guy who doesn't mind
unpaid college kids contracting"

364
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,120
"a potentially deadly disease so
everyone else can make millions"

365
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,040
is right down near the bottom,

366
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,640
along with the advice
of "funeral parlor magnate"

367
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,440
and "the coronavirus
wearing a fake mustache."

368
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,240
Gundy later apologized
for those comments,

369
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,240
but there was a real honesty
to what he said there.

370
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,720
Profit is a powerful motivator here,
especially for some team owners,

371
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,360
who won't be
the ones taking the risks.

372
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,560
It's why major sports
like baseball and football

373
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,280
are so eagerly pursuing
plans to come back.

374
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,960
Assuming that you can't just stage
all events in Jacksonville

375
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,720
or on some
stupidly-named island somewhere,

376
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,120
how do you do it
in the safest possible way?

377
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,480
For what it's worth, Anthony Fauci
has outlined how that could happen.

378
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,000
There's a way of doing that.
Nobody comes to the stadium,

379
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,960
put them in big hotels,
wherever you want to play,

380
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,840
keep them very well surveilled,
namely a surveillance,

381
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,680
but have them tested like every week.

382
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,680
And make sure they don't wind up
infecting each other or their family

383
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,440
and just let them
play the season out.

384
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,200
You just isolate everyone involved
and test the hell out of them.

385
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,640
Which, intuitively,
seems like it might work.

386
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,120
After all, we already have a show
where a bunch of people

387
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,480
with incredible bodies get monitored
all day to make sure

388
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,240
that they don't touch each other,
it's called "Too Hot To Handle"

389
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,520
and it is perfect.

390
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,720
One of the hot idiots proposed to one
of the other hot idiots with a Ring Pop

391
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,560
and if you haven't watched this show

392
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,640
and you're still complaining about
being "starved for content",

393
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,560
you're out of your fucking mind.

394
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,280
And ideas along the lines
of what Fauci just proposed,

395
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,040
so-called "bubble leagues",
have been floated for multiple sports.

396
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,800
Major League Baseball, for instance,
was at one point reportedly

397
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,200
discussing plans to play
all of their games in Arizona.

398
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,880
On its face, that seems simple:

399
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,520
you just seclude the teams and
you have them play with no fans.

400
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,520
When you think about that
for more than a second,

401
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,560
it all becomes
much more complicated.

402
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,160
Of course, you wouldn't
just be isolating players,

403
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,800
you'd be doing that for coaching staff,
team physicians, trainers, umpires,

404
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,880
clubhouse attendants, bus drivers,
camera crews and hotel staff.

405
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,520
By one estimate,
even a bubble league

406
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,320
would require nearly 10 000 people,
who would need constant testing.

407
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,520
There is a key distinction here.
Because, while pro wrestlers,

408
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,920
UFC fighters and college athletes
have no union,

409
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,320
those in major pro sports do.

410
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,240
Therefore, they have
significant negotiating power.

411
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,720
If you want them to isolate
themselves from families

412
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,800
and put their lives at risk,
you need their agreement.

413
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,920
And some big names,
like the Angels' Mike Trout,

414
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,360
still have some significant concerns.

415
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,000
What are you gonna do with family
members? My wife is pregnant.

416
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,840
What am I gonna do when
she goes into labor?

417
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,040
Am I gonna have to quarantine
for two weeks after I come back

418
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,960
'cause obviously I can't miss that,
you know, birth of our first child.

419
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,640
Yeah, he's right.

420
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,840
The League should not ask anyone
to miss the birth of their first child,

421
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,520
that is a magic moment.

422
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,840
Now, second child, that's negotiable.
Same shit, different day.

423
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,360
The third child, I'm not even sure
the mother has to be there.

424
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,280
But that first child
is simply unmissable.

425
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,840
And after pushback
from multiple players,

426
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,280
Major League Baseball has
walked away from the Arizona idea,

427
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,600
with an official even saying
earlier this month:

428
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,600
"I would be lying if we were
to say we have a good idea."

429
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,600
"They're all degrees of bad."

430
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,000
And that is true of so many current
proposals for sports to come back,

431
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,960
the second you start
reading the details of any plan,

432
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,400
it automatically becomes ridiculous.

433
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,360
The MLB's new idea is to play
an abbreviated season

434
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,160
in as many empty
home ballparks as possible.

435
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,480
But, teams would still have
to travel to those,

436
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,760
meaning
they're not being quarantined.

437
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,240
And for a sense of just how easy
it is for something to go wrong,

438
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,520
look at Germany.

439
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,080
That country has handled
this pandemic much better

440
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,440
and they are in a very different
situation than we are in the U.S.

441
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,120
That enabled their soccer league
to actually come back this weekend,

442
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,520
employing a kind
of bubble league approach,

443
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,320
without fans and with all team
personnel quarantined in a hotel.

444
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,000
But, two players
have already tested positive,

445
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,560
forcing their entire team
to isolate for 14 days.

446
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,080
One top coach missed the first game

447
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,680
after he left
the hotel to buy toothpaste

448
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,640
and now can't rejoin his team
until he has two negative tests.

449
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,920
And that shows just how difficult
it is to do any of this effectively.

450
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,240
I will own the fact I really want
sports to come back.

451
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,560
There is no doubt that
they have the ability to inspire.

452
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,320
One of the things that sport does
best is to bring people together

453
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,320
in times of crisis, like when Yankees
resumed playing after 9/11.

454
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,640
Unfortunately, though,
bringing people together

455
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,520
is the exact thing
we should not be doing right now.

456
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,280
While sport was genuinely helpful
at the start of this crisis

457
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,840
in showing us
how serious the virus was,

458
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,760
if it comes back too soon,
and irresponsibly,

459
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,120
it won't be an inspiration,
it'll be a cautionary tale.

460
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,040
As hard as it is to hear,
we might need a little more time

461
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,800
to make sure that we get this right,
phasing sports back in slowly,

462
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,000
with tailored approaches
that take into account

463
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,240
each sports' level of contact and
robust systems of testing and tracing.

464
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,360
I know that there is currently
an absence in people's lives.

465
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,000
Ideally, what you'd want is something
that could fill that gap for a while,

466
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,120
until sports can return, something
with an existing infrastructure,

467
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,840
a schedule of heart-pounding events,
a passionate fan base

468
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,200
and no human contact, something
to which I am obviously building.

469
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,640
If you've been on Twitter lately,
you may have seen this viral video.

470
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,416
Marbles in the blocks,
and they're off!

471
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,320
It's a neck and neck and neck race
up there at the front

472
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,560
and actually
Comet hits the divider.

473
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,560
The Attenuator slows him down
and he falls back into third place

474
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,440
under the clutches
of Deep Ocean.

475
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,160
So, it's Reflector out front and
now Tarantula takes the lead.

476
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,240
Fuck yes. Let me introduce you
to Jelle's Marble Runs.

477
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,720
They're based in the Netherlands

478
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,080
and they are a competitive
marble racing league,

479
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,720
that is, to put it mildly,
absolutely fantastic.

480
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,560
They upload races to this
YouTube channel on a regular basis

481
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,280
and nobody to whom we have shown
this, including non-sports fans,

482
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,480
has not ended up wanting
to watch more.

483
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,800
There are entire racetracks
with marbles as fans,

484
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,960
plus a marble tournament
with 16 different events

485
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,040
featuring relays, water courses
and obstacles.

486
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,800
There are also backstories
for the marbles involved

487
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,000
and some truly passionate fans.

488
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,560
20 000 people from around the world
tuned in live to watch last week's race

489
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,520
and Jelle's Marble Runs' YouTube
channel has millions of views.

490
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,400
There are big fan bases built up,
not just for the teams,

491
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,880
but for the individual marbles.

492
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,400
When one isn't performing
very well in the season,

493
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,816
you're gonna hear about it
on there.

494
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,800
And they will let that marble know
they gotta pick up their game.

495
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,160
Now, on the one hand,
that's amazing.

496
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,960
On the other hand,
the marbles don't really need fans

497
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,576
to tell them
when they're off their game.

498
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,720
Take a look at the Midnight Wisps.
Came in fourth in their debut season,

499
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,360
just missing the podium.

500
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,640
But, did they settle for that?
No, they didn't.

501
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,480
They came back the next year
and they won it all!

502
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,160
They used their shortcomings
as motivation to come back stronger.

503
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,640
Or... rounder?

504
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,320
I don't know, whichever adjective
is best for marbles.

505
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,240
The point is, this isn't just
a YouTube distraction,

506
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,440
it's a beautiful, competitive event

507
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,400
and the world needs those
more than ever right now.

508
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,560
This year's marble league tournament
is actually due to start next month.

509
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,800
Unfortunately,
with times being hard,

510
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,120
the League was struggling for money,
even tweeting:

511
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,640
"To make the ♪MarbleLeague
we need sponsors,"

512
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,440
"a headsponsor
and some smaller sponsors."

513
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,800
So, this beautiful thing
is in danger of going away,

514
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,520
just when we need it the most.

515
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,120
Or, rather, it was in danger,
because it turns out,

516
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,920
they're not actually looking
for a sponsor anymore.

517
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,400
And the reason I know that
is you are looking

518
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,440
at the new, sole sponsor
of the upcoming tournament.

519
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,840
That is right:
we are proudly sponsoring

520
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,560
all 16 events over
the next few months.

521
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,176
But wait,
because there is a twist here.

522
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,480
In addition to our sponsorship,
the winner of each event

523
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,240
will get $5 000 donated
to a food bank in their name.

524
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,880
Whether is the Raspberry Racers,
the Green Ducks, the Hazers

525
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,680
or even the Oceanics, although,

526
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,800
they'll need a ton of reorganization
in the locker room

527
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,240
because they were
a fucking mess last year.

528
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,480
And what's more,
at the end of the entire tournament,

529
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,520
the overall winner will get
a $20 000 donation

530
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,240
made in their marble team's name
to the International Rescue Committee.

531
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,640
It is the only way
that we could think

532
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,200
of making what these guys
are doing even better.

533
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,800
So, please, check this out.

534
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,480
Jelle's Marble Runs
and Last Week Tonight present.

535
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,080
Down they come,
Hazers to the lead.

536
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,640
Green Ducks into the water.
They have a lot of trouble moving

537
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,960
through those quick chicanes
to start things off.

538
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,920
Can the Savage Speeders
keep their momentum up?

539
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,096
They fall into the final funnel.

540
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,000
Raspberry Racers fight for gold!

541
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:18,200
The sports event of the summer
has arrived.

542
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,800
Unbelievable.

543
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,960
He was knocked off.
Fight going on in the fan section.

544
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,680
Raspberry Racers, they take the lead.
Neck in neck, all four...

545
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,960
Finish line in sight.
Who's gonna get it?

546
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,760
Marble League 2020.
Premiering June 21st.

547
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,600
This One's for All the Marbles.

548
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,800
You can find the Marble League
in June at this website,

549
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,320
although you can catch up
on past races right now.

550
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,760
That's our show, we're off next week
so we'll see you in two weeks.

551
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,880
Thank you so much for
watching, marble fans, good night!

552
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,120
