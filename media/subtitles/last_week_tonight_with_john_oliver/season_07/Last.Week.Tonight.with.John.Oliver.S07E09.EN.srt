00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,080
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,480
SEASON VII
EPISODE 9

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,280
Welcome to the show,

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,880
which is still taking place
in this blank void:

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,120
TV's greatest celebration of whiteness
since "Frasier".

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,960
It's been another brutal week,

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,920
with the occasional bright spot,
like learning Judi Dench

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,880
is apparently doing TikTok dances
with her grandson over FaceTime.

9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,800
Hard yes on that.
I think we all learned a lot there.

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,680
One, Judi Dench can hit the Woah
like a fucking pro.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,520
Two, her grandson
might be Ed Sheeran.

12
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,160
And three, life's getting pretty weird
on earth right now.

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,560
But sadly,
we have to put all that aside

14
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,120
and turn straight to our main story
this week, various corn.

15
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,080
I thought we were gonna talk
about something depressing,

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,880
but instead... wait a minute !

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,000
Coronavirus, is that you ?
You sneaky little bugger !

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,360
I should have known.
It's always you, coronavirus !

19
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,280
You're an absolute nightmare !

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,480
The fact is, Covid-19 is still
dominating the news every day,

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,080
and it's hard to keep up
with all the information about it

22
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,280
to say nothing
of the misinformation.

23
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,600
Here's the myth: you need to microwave
your mail to kill the Covid-19 virus.

24
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,840
Mail is not food
and you can't cook it.

25
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,240
Garlic does have
some antimicrobial properties

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,080
but there is absolutely
no evidence that it kills Covid-19.

27
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,200
Adults are buying breast milk

28
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,400
because some believe that
it can protect them from Covid-19.

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,040
Do not buy breast milk to prevent
Covid. That is not gonna help you.

30
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,960
You should absolutely not be buying
other people's breast milk

31
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,040
to protect you
from the coronavirus.

32
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,640
Not only will it not work,
you're taking it away

33
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,800
from the babies and the perverts
who genuinely need it.

34
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,800
Bullshit regarding this virus is
widespread and people are acting on it.

35
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,360
We saw protests all over the country
against stay-at-home orders.

36
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,680
And some of the attendees,
like at Michigan's Operation Gridlock

37
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,640
seemed motivated
by very questionable information.

38
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,160
What about concerns for safety
and spreading this virus

39
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,280
and potentially killing more people ?

40
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,440
I think it's all hype.

41
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,680
We're against these big corporates

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,560
that are trying to rack in
all these dollars

43
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,640
who created the disease and now
want to make people pay for the cure.

44
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,240
The flu kills more people
than this does !

45
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,280
What's worrying about that,
other than absolutely everything,

46
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,360
is that you may have even heard
some of those arguments

47
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,120
from people you're related to
or people you love

48
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,760
which can, incidentally,
be two very distinct groups.

49
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,440
Polls show that, when asked about
the death rate, 40% of Americans

50
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,000
believe Covid-19 is less deadly
or just as deadly as the flu.

51
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,760
Which it's not.
It is many times deadlier.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,040
Comparing the coronavirus
to the flu

53
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,800
is like comparing Jeffrey Dahmer
to O.J. Simpson.

54
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,440
I'm not saying O.J. is great,

55
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,760
I'm just saying he wouldn't have even
filled up Dahmer's vegetable drawer.

56
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,520
And bad information
is not only frustrating,

57
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,920
to the extent that it motivates people
to ignore stay-at-home measures,

58
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,640
it's both dangerous
and could actually end up

59
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,880
forcing us to stay at home
for longer.

60
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,040
If you are thinking, "How can people
possibly believe shit like that ?"

61
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,360
That's actually our story tonight:

62
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,240
the bad information
flying around about this virus

63
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,480
and the places
that people are getting it from.

64
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,240
Because there are a lot
of media bubbles out there

65
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,120
and getting a glimpse outside of the
one that you're in can be eye-opening.

66
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,240
For example, if you're not
a regular viewer of televangelist

67
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,800
and humble private jet farmer,
Kenneth Copeland,

68
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,320
you might now know that he took
care of Covid-19 weeks ago.

69
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,560
Covid-19 !

70
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,160
I blow...

71
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,040
... the wind of God...

72
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,440
... on you !

73
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,360
You are destroyed forever.

74
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,440
And you will never be back.

75
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,200
Setting aside his crew of the four
weeniest hype men of all time,

76
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,320
spitting all over the place
is not gonna cure anything.

77
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,480
Unless your plan is to give
the coronavirus the coronavirus,

78
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,000
in which case:
best of luck to you.

79
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,360
Although, I do understand why Copeland
is so determined to end this pandemic.

80
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,200
If I had few weeks until my tragically
obvious hair dye started to fade,

81
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,680
I'd be anxious that my colorist
be allowed to leave their home too.

82
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,320
Especially if I'd already
claimed on my actual website

83
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,680
that my unnaturally dark hair
at the age of 82

84
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,320
was simply the result
of standing in the mirror and saying,

85
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,200
"Glory to God.
Hair, grow dark brown."

86
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,760
"Thick be, in the Name of Jesus.
Bald spots, no !"

87
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,920
My point is: there's a lot at stake
here for Kenneth Copeland.

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,600
But the televangelist world
is just one of the many bubbles.

89
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,600
There's also an ecosystem
of conspiracy theories,

90
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,480
like the false belief that the virus
was caused by 5G networks

91
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,920
something that led people to set fire
to cell towers in the U.K. this month.

92
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,600
Which is just ridiculous,

93
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,920
although not as ridiculous
as the fact that those flaming towers

94
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,240
almost certainly still offered better
coverage than AT&T.

95
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,600
Oh, that's right, business daddy !

96
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,160
You thought a pandemic would
bring us together ? Of course not.

97
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,040
Our feud must be an essential
service 'cause it's still in business !

98
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,440
Seriously, though, B.D.:
I do hope you're safe and healthy.

99
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,000
I can't wait to talk to you
as soon as this is over

100
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,040
and as soon as I get more
than one bar of service.

101
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,040
But here in the U.S., one of the
biggest and most robust bubbles

102
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,880
is the right-wing mediasphere.

103
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,880
It's dominated by some enormously
powerful individuals,

104
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,280
not just on TV, but, importantly,
on conservative talk radio,

105
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,920
where the most powerful host
is undeniably Rush Limbaugh,

106
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,720
a man with millions of listeners,
a presidential Medal of Freedom,

107
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,720
and, almost certainly,
a room in his basement

108
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,680
that his housekeeper
isn't allowed to go into.

109
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,880
Even well into the outbreak,

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,120
Limbaugh has been spouting
some fabulously wrong information.

111
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,120
Here he is on March 11th.

112
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,120
This coronavirus ?
All of this panic is not warranted.

113
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,240
I'm telling you,
when I tell you,

114
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,200
when I've told you
that this virus is the common cold,

115
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,680
when I said that,
it was based on the number of cases.

116
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,520
It's also based
on the kind of virus this is.

117
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,760
Why do you think this is Covid-19 ?
This is the 19th coronavirus !

118
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,200
They're not uncommon.

119
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,880
No, Rush. Just no. No to you
claiming Covid-19 got its name

120
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,480
because it was
the "19th coronavirus".

121
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,480
It's called that because
it was first identified in 2019,

122
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,360
you gigantic potato.

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,560
But also, no to the virus
being the common cold.

124
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,440
No to this being "not uncommon".
No to your gold microphone.

125
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,080
No to your browser
being opened to "The Drudge Report".

126
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,280
No to your logo that looks like
two pairs of breasts are in a fight.

127
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,440
No to the mysterious
can on your desk

128
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,240
which I can only assume
is PAM Original Cooking Spray.

129
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,440
But most of all,
no to your stupid quarantine beard.

130
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,960
You look like if Santa was Me-Too'ed,
kicked out of the North Pole,

131
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,120
and forced to move to a condo
in Tampa with all-linoleum floors.

132
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,560
I hate it !

133
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,560
The problem is
many in conservative media

134
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,880
have found it easy
to fold this virus

135
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,480
into narratives that they've been
carefully building up for decades.

136
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,000
Limbaugh has spent years pushing
his "Four Corners of Deceit,"

137
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,760
which consist of government,
academia, science, and the media

138
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,280
which happen to be the four most
important groups to listen to

139
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,160
during a public health crisis.

140
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,360
And I understand
why he'd sow that doubt

141
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,920
if you establish your show
as the sole outlet worth trusting,

142
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,760
that gives you a lot of power.

143
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,160
And he's not alone
in utilizing that technique.

144
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,960
Fox News's recurrent pitch
to its audience

145
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,560
has been that it will tell you
the true story

146
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,640
that elites and the mainstream media
are trying to hide.

147
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,760
And that's how some of their hosts
played this virus initially

148
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,600
as a hysterical attack by the media
to derail the president,

149
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,280
with segments titled,
"Coronavirus Hysteria !",

150
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,480
"Liberal Media Hoax Backfires !", and
"Trump Confronts the Panic Pushers".

151
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,720
And when people started dying
and the argument became harder to sell,

152
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,920
the network seemed to pivot,
from trying to downplay the warnings,

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,560
to downplaying the deaths.

154
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,600
To date thankfully 0 people in the USA
have died from the coronavirus. Zero.

155
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,160
We have 6 deaths from the coronavirus,
18,000 deaths from the flu.

156
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,800
Nine people have died !
That's tragic but it's teeny !

157
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,640
22 people have been killed.

158
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,280
Those numbers pale in comparison
to the number of flu cases

159
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,800
over this flu season.

160
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,280
An estimated 60,000 Americans
will die from the coronavirus.

161
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,560
According to the CDC in 2018, 61,000
Americans died of the annual flu.

162
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,440
The fact of the matter is,
we have people dying

163
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,080
45,000 people a year
die from automobile accidents,

164
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,600
480,000 from cigarettes,

165
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,640
360,000 a year from swimming pools,
but we don't shut the country down.

166
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,960
Thanks, not-a-medical-Doctor Phil !

167
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,800
The annual U.S. death toll
from swimming pools

168
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,240
isn't actually 360,000.

169
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,400
They're not killing
almost a Cleveland every year.

170
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,120
The total number of drownings,
period, is around 4,000.

171
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,040
Also, if swimming pools
were killing 360,000 people a year

172
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,840
and you could contract a swimming
pool on a trip to the grocery store

173
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,040
we might want to think
about shutting them down

174
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,560
until we worked out
what the fuck was going on.

175
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,960
And a lot of people underestimated
the danger of this virus early on.

176
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,760
But Fox was still doing it,
not just as the death toll mounted,

177
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,560
but even as, behind the scenes,

178
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,880
their own company was suspending
non-essential business travel,

179
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and encouraging employees to cancel
all in person meetings and summits,

180
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,160
and conduct business
via Skype or by phone.

181
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:15,000
Because they only pretend to believe
these things on television for money.

182
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,120
The problem is our current president
isn't the subject of this misinformation

183
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,760
he is, as we all know,
also the target of it,

184
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,320
often pulling his talking points
directly from what he sees.

185
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,280
Late last month,
a popular conservative narrative

186
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,760
became that it was time
to reopen the economy

187
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,880
and Fox's Steve Hilton
encapsulated it like this.

188
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,240
You know that famous phrase,
"the cure is worse than the disease" ?

189
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,040
That is the territory
we are hurtling towards.

190
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,080
I'm pretty sure Trump saw that,

191
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,120
because a couple of hours
after that segment aired,

192
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,960
he tweeted, "We cannot let the cure
be worse than the problem itself",

193
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,680
and the next day,
couldn't seem to stop saying it.

194
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,720
We cannot let the cure
be worse than the problem itself.

195
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,840
That's why I talk about the cure
being worse than the problem.

196
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,440
We can't have the cure
be worse than the problem.

197
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,880
When I say the cure, and the cure
can be worse than the problem itself.

198
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,200
That's what I...
we can't let that happen.

199
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,680
It's pretty depressing
to see the president

200
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,560
just parroting what he heard on TV
the night before.

201
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,280
And if he's gonna do that,
the very least he could do

202
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,040
is pick a better show than
Steve Hilton's "The Next Revolution".

203
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,640
Why not go
with "Below Deck Sailing Yacht" ?

204
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,640
That way, we'd get to hear
the President of the United States

205
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,000
tell us about how
Adam the chef is a tease,

206
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,480
and how Madison needs to understand
her role in the interior pecking order

207
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,080
and start listening to her chief stew,

208
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,760
because Jenna
does not need to take her shit.

209
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,480
Yes, it wouldn't be helpful
during a pandemic,

210
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,800
but at least
it wouldn't be actively harmful.

211
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,720
That is what is
infuriating here.

212
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,880
Even though Trump has access
to the country's top experts,

213
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,360
he's still getting advice
from watching TV.

214
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,360
And not just on talking points,
but on medicine.

215
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,040
Take hydroxychloroquine.

216
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,160
It's a drug used for conditions
like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.

217
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,920
And it got a huge boost in mid-March
as a potential coronavirus treatment

218
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,600
from Tucker Carlson's show.

219
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,400
Early evidence suggests
that chloroquine,

220
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,000
a cheap antimalaria drug, may be
effective in treating coronavirus.

221
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,280
Gregory Rigano is an advisor at the
Stanford University School of Medicine,

222
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,800
and he joins us tonight.

223
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,600
A well-controlled,
peer-reviewed study carried out

224
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,720
by the most eminent infectious
disease specialist in the world

225
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,000
showed a 100% cure rite-cure rate
against coronavirus.

226
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,760
I only know what you're telling me,

227
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,600
but I do know it's very unusual
for a study of anything to pursuit

228
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,920
to produce results
of a hundred percent.

229
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,920
That's remarkable, isn't it ?
Or am I missing something ?

230
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,120
You're very much missing
something, Tucker.

231
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,080
That man's role as an advisor
to Stanford University

232
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,920
was news to Stanford,
who've since clarified,

233
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,960
"Gregory Rigano is not an advisor
with their school of medicine"

234
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,840
"and no one at Stanford
was involved in the study".

235
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,200
As for that "100% cure rate",

236
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,680
you should know they obtained that
by omitting three patients

237
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,960
who were transferred to an ICU
and one patient who died.

238
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,400
And it is very easy
to have a 100% success rate

239
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,720
if you just leave out
any result that wasn't a success.

240
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,960
Nevertheless, the very next day,

241
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,760
Trump publicly mentioned
hydroxychloroquine for the first time

242
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,680
and has since brought it up constantly,
with varying degrees of recklessness.

243
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:29,560
I hope that hydroxychloroquine wins.

244
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,600
What do you have to lose ?
I'll say it again !

245
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,600
I really think they should take it.

246
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,000
"What do you have to lose ?
Take it !"

247
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,480
What are you doing ?
You're the president,

248
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,040
not a mean sophomore trying
to pressure me into doing Adderall.

249
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,000
Also, in terms of what you have
to lose, possibly quite a bit,

250
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,440
as doctors are warning
the drug can trigger arrhythmia,

251
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,720
which can lead to a fatal heart attack
in certain patients.

252
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,920
That is not to say that this drug
shouldn't be studied. It should. It is.

253
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,720
But the feedback loop
between Fox and Trump

254
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,560
has run way ahead
of the science here.

255
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,840
In one two-week period,
Fox personalities and their guests

256
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,000
made claims promoting
hydroxychloroquine nearly 300 times,

257
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,400
with Laura Ingraham even visiting Trump
at the White House earlier this month

258
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,200
to advocate for the drug.

259
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,760
Thanks to this media frenzy,
the efficacy of this drug,

260
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,400
which should be a scientific issue,
has become a political one.

261
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,560
Anyone saying they want
more comprehensive studies

262
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,800
can be dismissed
by the right as a Trump hater.

263
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,120
If you argue that we shouldn't make
decisions based on anecdotal evidence,

264
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Rush Limbaugh
has a ready response.

265
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,120
Anecdotally it's been pos...
Anecdotal ?

266
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,400
It just means it hasn't been
scientifically tested in mass numbers,

267
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,000
but it means it's working.

268
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,120
Anecdotally, I arrived at work
today. It means it happened.

269
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,440
Right. Anecdotally, you arrived
at work today, Rush.

270
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,560
That alone doesn't mean that
everyone arrived at work today,

271
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,880
or even that most people
arrived at work today.

272
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,520
It just means that you did.

273
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,440
There is a process for knowing
whether a scientific claim is true

274
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,000
and it involves testing and observing
results in a controlled setting,

275
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,000
rather than yelling your thoughts
confidently into C-3PO's penis.

276
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,080
I know it is easy to write off
Limbaugh as a right-wing blowhard,

277
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,520
but the reality is he draws
over 15 million listeners a week,

278
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,560
among the most loyal of whom
is the president,

279
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,960
who considers Limbaugh
a real-time metric

280
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,720
of how his decisions
are playing with his supporters.

281
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,920
And all this time, existing
patients with conditions like lupus

282
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,880
who have been taking
hydroxychloroquine for years,

283
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,600
are now struggling to get it.

284
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,000
One large health care provider
even wrote to lupus patients,

285
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,440
telling them that due
to a worldwide shortage,

286
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,720
it won't refill
their prescriptions, saying:

287
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,480
"Thank you for the sacrifice
you will be making".

288
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,840
I'd like nothing more than if this
was, somehow, a miracle cure.

289
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,000
But I can't say it is
and I can't say it isn't,

290
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,560
because it's still being tested
and I'm not a fucking doctor.

291
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,560
It might ! It could !
It's too soon to say !

292
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,880
The problem is "might" and "could"
aren't words that grab an audience.

293
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,880
That is why cable news often traffics
in bright, primary colors

294
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,280
and easy storylines.

295
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,640
Me telling you that we have to wait
for results

296
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,760
just isn't satisfying to hear
or to watch.

297
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,280
And throughout this crisis,
Fox has constantly presented

298
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,640
simple solutions
to complex problems.

299
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,720
Watch Sean Hannity formulate
a plan, seemingly in real-time,

300
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,680
for resuming baseball games
by testing every person in attendance

301
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,360
and having them wear PPE.

302
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,840
If it's my choice and I have to wear
gloves, a mask... Okay, I'll wear it.

303
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,640
I'd rather go and wear it.
If everyone else is wearing it,

304
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,400
we can suck it up for a couple
of months until things have passed.

305
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,080
Can't eat popcorn 'cause you have
to keep your mask off the whole time,

306
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,720
but you probably
could eat a hot dog.

307
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,480
You open up your respirator,
take a bite

308
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,320
and you chew it under your mask.

309
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,960
I have to drink my beer
if I'm at a game,

310
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,120
so if I have to use a straw
and slip it in, I'll do that.

311
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,640
I would rather have my temperature
taken, drink beer from a straw,

312
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,840
eat a hot dog by going like this
and chewing it in a mask

313
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,720
than not go at all, that's
my decision, you make yours.

314
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,080
I'm pro-choice.

315
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,520
Are you, really ?

316
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,120
Setting aside the pro-choice line,
you're right, Sean,

317
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,680
your body, your choice,
I don't see a single flaw in that.

318
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,600
Obviously,
you couldn't eat popcorn.

319
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,160
But you could get a hot dog in your
mouth before the virus could sneak in.

320
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,000
That's just science.
Anecdotally, I know a guy

321
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,720
who ate a hot dog once
and didn't get coronavirus,

322
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,560
so that absolutely checks out.

323
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,160
While that's almost
incomprehensibly stupid,

324
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,720
you can't deny: it's good TV.

325
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,720
The skills required to produce TV
and to govern are very different.

326
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,120
And unfortunately,

327
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,120
we have a president who doesn't
seem to know the difference.

328
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,000
At the start of his presidency,
he famously told top aides

329
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,800
to think of each presidential day
like an episode of a television show

330
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,720
in which he vanquishes rivals.

331
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,720
We have a network and a president
who thrive on division,

332
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,520
feeding on one another,
at a time when we desperately need

333
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,280
a unified response
to a public health crisis.

334
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,200
And all that brings us back
to the protests we discussed earlier.

335
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,320
Hundreds of people have taken
to the streets this week,

336
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,200
fueled by the kind of misinformation
rampant in right-wing media,

337
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,920
the same right-wing media

338
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,160
which then eagerly covered the protests
that they helped create, like this.

339
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,000
Protests popping up
all across America

340
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,320
as some fed-up folks are demanding
an end to stay at home orders.

341
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,200
They got in front of the Governor's
Residence in St. Paul yesterday.

342
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,920
They referenced things
like President Trump's statement

343
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,360
that the cure cannot
be worse than the disease.

344
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,960
"The cure can't be worse than
the disease" isn't Trump's statement,

345
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,040
he stole that phrase
from you guys !

346
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,640
You shouldn't be crediting him
with that,

347
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,480
you should be charging him
with copyright infringement.

348
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,200
And like clockwork, Trump,
just a few minutes after that segment

349
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,960
highlighted groups
like "Liberate Minnesota",

350
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,240
tweeted out:
"LIBERATE MINNESOTA !"

351
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,160
followed by "LIBERATE MICHIGAN !",
and then "LIBERATE VIRGINIA".

352
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,000
All of this is legitimately dangerous
because watching coverage like that

353
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,200
might convince Trump that there's
a sizeable portion of the population

354
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,000
that wants to go back to work
no matter the cost.

355
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,800
But that's not currently the case.
66 percent of Americans say

356
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,480
they are more concerned restrictions
will be lifted too quickly

357
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,640
than too slowly.

358
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,400
It's frankly remarkable
that number is so high,

359
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,440
after weeks of this bullshit.

360
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:46,360
I get Trump, Fox, and those protestors
wanting all of this to be over.

361
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,160
I do too. I want people
to be able to get back to work

362
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,720
and to get some sense
of normalcy restored.

363
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,320
But for what it's worth, I know
people who've died from this.

364
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,160
I also know people who are taking
hydroxychloroquine

365
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,560
because they think
it will give them immunity.

366
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,480
I know people with lupus who are
down to their last few weeks of pills.

367
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,400
And it makes me fucking furious.

368
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,720
Because the fact is,
the fastest way for this to be over

369
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,800
is for all of us to remain united
in this very difficult task.

370
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,280
But the only way that happens
is if we have trusted,

371
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,680
well-informed leadership,
which unfortunately, we don't.

372
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,720
Instead, we have a compulsive liar
constantly listening to voices

373
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,400
telling him that this is nothing more
than the common cold

374
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,440
with potentially
a 100 percent cure available,

375
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,520
and that there's already
a great plan to restart baseball

376
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,040
even as there's a swimming pool
killing spree that, for some reason,

377
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,600
nobody's talking about.

378
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,920
While there are no easy solutions

379
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,960
to make this irresponsible
media magically disappear,

380
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,360
I guess there's one trick
we haven't tried yet,

381
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,680
so if you'll excuse me,
here it goes.

382
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,120
Right-wing media !

383
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,560
I blow on you !

384
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,920
Did that work ? No ? Everything's
still a fucking nightmare ?

385
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,360
Well, it was worth a shot.
What did I have to lose ?

386
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,120
And now, this.

387
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,680
An All-Coronavirus Installment
of Coming Up On "Inside Edition".

388
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,840
With the world in crisis.

389
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,120
Why so many see the Covid-19
pandemic as a sign of the apocalypse.

390
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,280
SpaghettiO's big comeback.

391
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,400
Plus.

392
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,840
How far can a single sneeze go ?

393
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,520
Potential germ splatter.

394
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,000
Then !
Where'd everybody go ?

395
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,960
Plus, let the wedding go on

396
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,320
with guests
made out of cardboard.

397
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,040
Then, are these beautiful beaches
spreading the virus ?

398
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,880
Could each wave
be like a giant sneeze ?

399
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,880
Does toilet paper really have a calming
effect during the coronavirus crisis ?

400
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,080
Get away from the window !

401
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,240
How not to go stir-crazy
in coronavirus quarantine.

402
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,600
Then, how nuts is this ?
Plus, books ! Remember those ?

403
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,600
Moving on. Before we go, I know
TV shows are looking different now.

404
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,240
Late-night shows are having
to do it from home.

405
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,680
And wrestlers are beating each other
in front of rows of empty chairs.

406
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,040
I would argue that no one
is handling this situation better

407
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,640
than Wendy Williams.

408
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,840
If you don't know who she is, here
is a taste of her show, pre-pandemic.

409
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,360
He's so weak, I don't even understand
how she gets moist for him.

410
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,840
Look, if anyone acts crazy,
just let's jump 'em. Okay ?

411
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,520
I have never farted
once on this show.

412
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,240
As a matter of fact,
I barely fart. You know why ?

413
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,920
Because gas gets released
several different ways.

414
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,680
Now, here's the thing,
that gas fact is true.

415
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,600
It comes out in lots of ways,
farts and burps ! That's science !

416
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,120
Which technically makes
Wendy's show educational.

417
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,160
There is nothing that she can't do.

418
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,760
And even though Wendy
is now stuck at home,

419
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,480
she's been producing some
spectacular content,

420
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,160
although, at first, she didn't seem
sure that she wanted to be doing it.

421
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,480
Here is a clip from the first
installment of "Wendy At Home"

422
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,000
and you should know,
we didn't add the splice

423
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,640
you're about to see,
it was in the original cut.

424
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,160
The show convinced me that

425
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,800
"Maybe, Wendy, while we're off,
reruns aren't enough"

426
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,280
and I'm like: "Where do you
expect to do stuff ?"

427
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,000
"I'm not leaving the house.
I'm not getting sick".

428
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,080
I feel better than I ever have...
Orangina, by the way.

429
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,800
I'm not leaving the house.

430
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,640
So, what do you want to do...
Just show up and do stuff.

431
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,520
Holy shit. She's sharing a screen

432
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,640
with a life-sized Betty Boop
decked out in Supreme gear,

433
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,600
Chanel accessories
and a disco ball,

434
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,160
and somehow she is still
the most engrossing thing in that shot,

435
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,760
simply eating a lamb chop
in a weirdly dominant manner.

436
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,800
Not many people
can pull that off.

437
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,600
Our original background was gonna be
a gray wall, but we had to lose it

438
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,640
after everyone agreed
it was more interesting than I was.

439
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,720
But even once Wendy settled in,

440
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,760
she still had to deal with some
minor technical problems.

441
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,440
Ok, number one.

442
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,040
Number two, you know,
you pay for that kind of service.

443
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,360
With some extra sharp cheese.
Now, here we are.

444
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,200
By the way, in case you hear
some chirping during our broadcast,

445
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,720
just know that I've been dealing
with a broken smoke detector

446
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,520
for the past one month.

447
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,720
And me and Chitchat and Myway are
so used to it, we're desensitized.

448
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,440
How can you be desensitized
to that, Wendy ?

449
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,200
The whole purpose
of a smoke detector's beep

450
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,040
is to irritate you
into letting it save your life,

451
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,880
especially if you live in
the world's most flammable apartment.

452
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,840
If you're wondering, by the way,
who "Chitchat" and "Myway" are,

453
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,920
they're actually Wendy's cats.

454
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,040
And a fun thing about them is that
whenever she calls for them,

455
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,400
they refuse to come.

456
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,400
The cats have not appeared one time
since I've been down here.

457
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:19,560
Chitchat, Myway ! Get down here !
This is your chance !

458
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,720
You girls love a good camera.

459
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,280
There's nothing surprising about cats
not coming when they're called.

460
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,120
You've never seen any cats on this
show and I have 28 of them.

461
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,840
Watch. Milk Dud ! Domino !
Guster ! Jefferson ! Opus !

462
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,800
Stanley ! Clown Car !
Becky ! Allison ! Deborah !

463
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,400
Gus ! Gus 2 ! Gus 3: The Final Gus !
Gus 4: A New Begussining !

464
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,400
Daniel Craig the Cat !
Gumdrop ! Mr. Pretty Whiskers !

465
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:56,400
Bluebell ! Amelia ! Reginald !
Strawberry ! Floofy Nummy Butterkins !

466
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,680
John Junior ! Stripey ! Noodles !
DiCatbe Mutombo !

467
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,360
Dikembe Catombo ! Frank !

468
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,760
See ? Nothing.
But the more you watch Wendy,

469
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,960
the more that you realize that chaos
isn't a problem with the show,

470
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,560
it's what makes it work.

471
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,640
The show is just Wendy at home,
expressing every thought in her head,

472
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,400
occasionally taking calls
and being sporadically interrupted

473
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,160
by a smoke alarm
which simply needs new batteries.

474
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:30,200
And unapologetically eating
increasingly weird meals on-camera.

475
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,800
Yes, chocolate licorice,
the breakfast of champions.

476
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,200
100 percent glitter
but a real pickle.

477
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,920
A little caviar and some Doritos.
This brings me up high,

478
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,200
this keeps me exactly
where I need to be.

479
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,240
Bacon, bleu cheese,

480
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
both smothered
by hot sauce and maple syrup.

481
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,760
You don't want to see me eat ?
Then you might not wanna be here.

482
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,640
This is what people do.

483
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,000
Is that what people do ?
I get that people do eat,

484
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,360
it's just not usually at the same time
that they're hosting a talk show

485
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,760
and telling anyone watching
to fuck off if they don't like it.

486
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,280
This isn't what people do. This is
what Wendy Williams does,

487
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,800
because Wendy Williams has ascended
to a level of fucks-not-given

488
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,440
that no human
has ever achieved before.

489
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,720
I was never a regular viewer of
"The Wendy Williams Show",

490
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,600
but I've become a big fan
of "Wendy At Home".

491
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,720
It's an oasis of truth
in a world full of lies.

492
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,520
It's a real pickle atop
a fake hamburger, if you will.

493
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,320
That is why it has cheered me up
so much to watch Wendy embrace

494
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,280
the glorious chaos
in her madcap apartment.

495
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,440
I wanted to find a way to repay her.

496
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,520
Unfortunately, I don't have
any hypebeast Betty Boop accessories.

497
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,920
But once again, in my time of need,
Wendy has provided the answer.

498
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,280
It came after she played a clip
of two women, Tiny and Shekinah,

499
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,360
who had been defending
Bill Cosby.

500
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,640
Bill Cosby needs to stay in jail
for all his years.

501
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,080
I don't know
what these girls are talking about.

502
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,880
But I was too distracted
by Tiny's onesie.

503
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,760
Norman,
I need that in my life.

504
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,160
There are only
but so many poofs I have.

505
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,280
I need that onesie in my life !

506
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,960
Wendy's right.
She does deserve that onesie.

507
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,960
How would you even go
about finding it for her ?

508
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,080
There are no leads in that clip.
And even if you could find it,

509
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,200
leisurewear is sold out
everywhere right now,

510
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,160
because of, you know,
everything.

511
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,680
Luckily, we have a tenacious research
team and a production department

512
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,800
that can assemble
the world's biggest cake

513
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,640
and stage a musical
in the middle of Times Square.

514
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,920
And when you ask them:

515
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,400
"Can you track down this star-spangled
onesie for Wendy Williams ?"

516
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,680
You know what they do ?
First, they flag that Wendy is wrong,

517
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,400
it's not actually a onesie,
it's a two-piece sweatsuit.

518
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,520
And then,
then you know what they do ?

519
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,040
They track that fucking thing down.
So here you go, Wendy,

520
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,120
this sweatsuit is for you.

521
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,400
Just tell us where to send it
and wear it in good health.

522
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,680
And please, don't you ever stop
eating on camera.

523
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,120
That's our show. Thanks so much
for watching. Good night !

524
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,120
If this makes you uncomfortable,

525
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,160
you might want to fuck off
and watch something else.

526
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,560
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
