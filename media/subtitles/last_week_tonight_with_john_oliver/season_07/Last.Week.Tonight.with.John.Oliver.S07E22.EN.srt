WELCOME TO THE SHOW STILL

5
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:28,346
TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK VOID.

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,600
THINK OF IT AS THE INSIDE OF

7
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,967
AN OYSTER, MAKING ME THE PEARL.

8
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:32,834
WHICH DOES MAKE SENSE... I'M A

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,166
SMALL WHITE IRRITANT TO WHICH

10
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:35,393
SOME PEOPLE HAVE INEXPLICABLY

11
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:36,300
ASSIGNED VALUE.

12
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:37,834
THIS WAS A BUSY WEEK, DOMINATED

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,100
BY THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL

14
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:39,767
CONVENTION, WHICH HAD TO BE HELD

15
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:41,000
VIRTUALLY THIS YEAR DUE TO...

16
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:42,934
Y'KNOW.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,033
AND THIS MEANT THINGS LOOKED

18
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,734
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT... OR,

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,533
AS PEOPLE ON TV PREFERRED TO PUT

20
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,433
THAT:

21
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,233
WE'RE CALLING THIS THE

22
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,600
UNCONVENTIONAL CONVENTION.

23
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:51,633
AN UNCONVENTIONAL CONVENTION.

24
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,600
UNCONVENTIONAL CONVENTION.

25
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:54,900
UNCONVENTIONAL CONVENTION.

26
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:55,867
I KNOW EVERYONE HAS BEEN

27
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:56,734
SAYING... IT'S A CLICHE...

28
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,667
AN UNCONVENTIONAL CONVENTION,

29
00:00:57,734 --> 00:00:58,800
AND IT HAS BEEN AN

30
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:00,700
UNCONVENTIONAL CONVENTION.

31
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:01,910
John: YEAH, OKAY, WE GET IT.

32
00:01:01,934 --> 00:01:03,066
IT WAS AN "UNCONVENTIONAL

33
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:03,734
CONVENTION."

34
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,967
THE THING IS, THAT'S ONE OF

35
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:06,300
THOSE PHRASES THAT SOUNDS LIKE

36
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:08,166
IT HAS GRAVITY, BUT ACTUALLY

37
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:08,800
MEANS NEXT TO NOTHING, LIKE

38
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:10,033
"IT IS WHAT IT IS" OR

39
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,000
"QUIBI EXCLUSIVE."

40
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:13,306
AND WHILE THE LACK OF ATTENDEES

41
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:15,200
DID MAKE SOME THINGS AWKWARD,

42
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:16,300
THERE WERE UPSIDES, TOO.

43
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,133
FOR INSTANCE, THE ROLL CALL OF

44
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,400
DELEGATES WAS DONE VIRTUALLY

45
00:01:18,467 --> 00:01:19,600
THIS YEAR, WITH STATES AND

46
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:20,533
TERRITORIES FINDING NOVEL WAYS

47
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,934
TO SHOWCASE THEMSELVES.

48
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,367
HAWAII RUBBED THEIR BEACHES IN

49
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:26,667
EVERYONE'S FACE, PETE BUTTIGIEG

50
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:27,266
SHOWED OFF WHAT I CAN ONLY

51
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,533
ASSUME IS HIS NEW SOCIAL MEDIA

52
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:29,400
START-UP, AND THE ENTIRE

53
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:30,710
POPULATION OF MONTANA TURNED UP.

54
00:01:30,734 --> 00:01:31,633
BUT IT WAS THE STATE OF

55
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,943
RHODE ISLAND THAT STOLE THE SHOW

56
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,767
WITH THIS MOMENT.

57
00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:35,433
RHODE ISLAND, THE OCEAN

58
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,600
STATE.

59
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:40,367
OUR STATE APPETIZER,

60
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,266
CALAMARI, IS AVAILABLE

61
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,500
IN ALL 50 STATES.

62
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:44,367
John: YEAH, THAT WAS RHODE

63
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:45,133
ISLAND'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY

64
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,934
CHAIRMAN PLEDGING DELEGATES

65
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
WHILE STANDING NEXT TO

66
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:48,300
A CALAMARI NINJA.

67
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:49,800
AND I HAD NO IDEA THAT CALAMARI

68
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:51,133
WAS RHODE ISLAND'S OFFICIAL

69
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,700
STATE APPETIZER.

70
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:54,009
IT MIGHT BE THE FIRST THING I'VE

71
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:54,900
LEARNED ABOUT THAT STATE THAT

72
00:01:54,967 --> 00:02:01,533
I'VE ACTUALLY LIKED.

73
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,200
ASIDE FROM, OF COURSE, THE FACT

74
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:03,276
THAT IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE CITY

75
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:03,967
OF DANBURY, CONNECTICUT.

76
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:04,800
I'VE SAID IT BEFORE:

77
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:05,667
FUCK DANBURY!

78
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:06,533
BABIES, ELDERLY, PETS, BUILDINGS

79
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,767
...ALL OF YOU CAN GO FUCK

80
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:08,900
YOURSELVES.

81
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:10,207
IN TERMS OF TONE, THE DNC SPENT

82
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:11,533
THE WEEK STEERING HARD TOWARD

83
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,033
THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.

84
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,867
BECAUSE WHILE, YES, THERE WERE

85
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:16,009
BRIEF APPEARANCES FROM STARS

86
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:17,567
LIKE AOC AND STACEY ABRAMS,

87
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:19,533
A LOT OF TIME WAS GIVEN TO

88
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,676
REPUBLICANS LIKE MEG WHITMAN,

89
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,567
COLIN POWELL, AND JOHN KASICH,

90
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:23,967
WHO DELIVERED HIS REMARKS

91
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:24,900
STANDING AT A LITERAL

92
00:02:24,967 --> 00:02:26,200
CROSSROADS.

93
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:29,166
AND IT'S HARD TO CONVINCE

94
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,433
PROGRESSIVE VOTERS THAT YOU'RE

95
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,333
A FORWARD-LOOKING PARTY WHEN

96
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,667
YOUR CONVENTION FEELS LIKE A

97
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:36,600
ZOOM CAST REUNION, EXCEPT

98
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:37,676
THE SHOW IS "THE 2008 RNC."

99
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,567
AS FOR BIDEN, HIS NOMINATION

100
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:39,400
SPEECH ALSO PLAYED IT SAFE,

101
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:40,767
SHOWCASING HIS WARMTH AND

102
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:42,033
HIS EMPATHY.

103
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,567
BUT WHILE HE NAME-CHECKED

104
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:44,710
BROAD GOALS LIKE "EXPANDING

105
00:02:44,734 --> 00:02:46,834
CHILD CARE" OR "ENDING RACISM,"

106
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,266
THE SPEECH WAS LIGHT ON DETAIL,

107
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,066
AND HEAVY ON LINES LIKE THIS:

108
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:51,500
THIS WILL DETERMINE WHAT

109
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:52,333
AMERICA IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE

110
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,233
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

111
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,934
CHARACTER IS ON THE BALLOT.

112
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,200
COMPASSION IS ON THE BALLOT.

113
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:00,000
DECENCY, SCIENCE, DEMOCRACY.

114
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:07,133
THEY'RE ALL ON THE BALLOT.

115
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,467
John: OKAY, NOW NORMALLY I

116
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:12,100
WOULD POINT OUT THAT PASSION AND

117
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,066
DECENCY ARE NOT

118
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:15,600
OPEN AUTHORITARIANISM

119
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:16,100
INITIATIVES, CONSIDERING

120
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:16,834
IS ALSO ON THE BALLOT, SURE,

121
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,133
WHAT THE FUCK... ADEQUATE VS.

122
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,200
EVIL.

123
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:20,033
LET'S GO.

124
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,834
AND I'M HONESTLY NOT SAYING IT'S

125
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,734
A MISTAKE FOR THE DNC TO SPEND

126
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,734
FOUR DAYS POINTING OUT THAT

127
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,810
JOE BIDEN'S NOT DONALD TRUMP.

128
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:24,843
IT'S A VERY ATTRACTIVE QUALITY.

129
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:25,943
BUT SPENDING SO MUCH OF THEIR

130
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:27,433
CONVENTION UNDERSCORING TRUMP'S

131
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,676
UNFITNESS FOR OFFICE MAY'VE BEEN

132
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,033
REDUNDANT, GIVEN THAT TRUMP

133
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,500
SPENT THE ENTIRE WEEK BASICALLY

134
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:33,066
MAKING THAT CASE FOR THEM,

135
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:34,633
BY CONTINUING TO SOW DISTRUST

136
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,843
OF VOTING BY MAIL, CALLING FOR

137
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:37,200
A BOYCOTT OF AN AMERICAN COMPANY

138
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:39,133
THAT EMPLOYS OVER 60,000

139
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,476
WORKERS, AND REFUSING TO DISAVOW

140
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
THE QANON CONSPIRACY THEORY.

141
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:44,934
BUT AS APPALLING AND

142
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,500
UNSURPRISING AS ALL OF THAT IS,

143
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:47,767
THE BIGGEST NEWS REGARDING HIM

144
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,333
ACTUALLY GOT BURIED THIS WEEK,

145
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,300
AND IT WAS THIS:

146
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:52,433
TONIGHT, THE REPUBLICAN-LED

147
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,400
SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

148
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,200
RELEASING ITS FINAL REPORT,

149
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:56,800
DECLARING THE 2016 TRUMP

150
00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:58,500
CAMPAIGN HAD REPEATED CONTACTS

151
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:00,266
WITH RUSSIAN OPERATIVES.

152
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,000
John: YEAH, THE SENATE'S

153
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:03,667
REPORT CONFIRMED TRUMP'S

154
00:04:03,734 --> 00:04:04,843
CAMPAIGN WAS UNCOMFORTABLY CLOSE

155
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:06,033
TO RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE.

156
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,100
IT'S SOMETHING WE ALREADY KNEW,

157
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,309
BUT IT IS STILL NICE TO HAVE IT

158
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,376
IN WRITING, LIKE WHEN YOUR DAD

159
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,440
SIGNS A BIRTHDAY CARD WITH

160
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:12,333
"I LOVE YOU."

161
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,300
SURE, HE MAY NOT BE EMOTIONALLY

162
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:15,609
READY TO SAY IT OUT LOUD, BUT AT

163
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:16,200
LEAST HE HAD YOUR MOM SCRIBBLE

164
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:17,667
IT ON TOP OF GARFIELD'S ASS.

165
00:04:17,734 --> 00:04:21,100
THAT'S NOT NOTHING.

166
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:21,300
IS IT?

167
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:22,200
THIS REPORT HAS NEW DETAILS, AND

168
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:24,333
CITES TRUMP'S FORMER CAMPAIGN

169
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,467
MANAGER, PAUL MANAFORT'S

170
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:27,033
WILLINGNESS TO SHARE INFORMATION

171
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,533
WITH INDIVIDUALS CLOSELY

172
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,333
AFFILIATED WITH RUSSIAN

173
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,166
INTELLIGENCE AS A GRAVE

174
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:31,033
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE THREAT.

175
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,467
NOT ONLY THAT, IT DETAILS HOW

176
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:33,700
ROGER STONE TRIED TO GET

177
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:34,967
WIKILEAKS TO DROP DAMAGING

178
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:36,109
EMAILS FROM HILLARY CLINTON'S

179
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:37,567
CAMPAIGN CHAIR, JUST AS THE

180
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:38,800
"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD" TAPE

181
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:39,600
CAME OUT.

182
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:40,567
AND WHILE TRUMP DENIED KNOWLEDGE

183
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:42,100
OF STONE'S ACTIVITIES TO

184
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,867
ROBERT MUELLER, THIS REPORT HAS

185
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:44,600
PUT ONE HELL OF AN ASTERISK

186
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,033
ON THAT.

187
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:47,600
THE COMMITTEE ASSESSES THAT

188
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:49,433
TRUMP DID, IN FACT, SPEAK WITH

189
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,200
STONE ABOUT WIKILEAKS ON

190
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:52,567
MULTIPLE OCCASIONS.

191
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:53,834
John: YEAH, OF COURSE.

192
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,066
NOT ONLY DID EVERYONE ASSUME

193
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:57,633
THAT, BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

194
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,710
TRUMP WOULDN'T HAVE REMEMBERED

195
00:04:58,734 --> 00:04:59,767
THAT CONVERSATION.

196
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:01,500
HOW WOULD ANYONE FORGET TALKING

197
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,066
TO ROGER STONE, A MAN WHO CAN

198
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:04,500
BEST BE DESCRIBED AS

199
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:07,333
VISUALLY TOO FUCKING MUCH?

200
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,543
THE BIPARTISAN REPORT... WHICH,

201
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:09,834
REMEMBER, COMES FROM A

202
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,767
REPUBLICAN-LED SENATE COMMITTEE

203
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:12,042
...IS A TRULY DAMNING INDICTMENT

204
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:15,734
OF TRUMP'S CHARACTER,

205
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,633
UNDERSCORING JUST HOW IMPORTANT

206
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,500
THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER IS.

207
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,767
AND AS MUCH AS THE DNC'S

208
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:20,233
PLATFORM OF "BIDEN IS NOT TRUMP"

209
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,343
SHOULD BE AN OVERWHELMINGLY

210
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:23,734
SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY, THE TRUTH

211
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,867
IS TRUMP STILL HAS A VERY REAL

212
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:27,266
CHANCE AT WINNING RE-ELECTION.

213
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:27,900
TAKE THAT RHODE ISLAND CALIMARI

214
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:28,533
CHEF.

215
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,433
"THE WASHINGTON POST" TRACKED

216
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,000
HIM DOWN, AND HE SAID HE'S NOT

217
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,300
SURE IF HE'LL VOTE FOR BIDEN

218
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,100
AT ALL, ADDING, HE DOESN'T

219
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,309
KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC

220
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,867
NOMINEE.

221
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:38,134
AND IT'S PRETTY FRUSTRATING TO

222
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:41,000
CLAIM YOU'RE ONLY VAGUELY AWARE

223
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:41,734
OF BIDEN.

224
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,910
BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

225
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:43,700
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT WHO'S BEEN

226
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:48,200
IN PUBLIC OFFICE FOR NEARLY

227
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:48,800
50 YEARS, NOT

228
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:49,700
PENN FUCKING BADGLEY.

229
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:50,776
AND WHILE YOUR INSTINCTIVE

230
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,734
REACTION MIGHT BE, "HOW THE FUCK

231
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,040
CAN ANYONE STILL BE UNDECIDED?"

232
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,066
THE SAD FACT IS, LOTS OF PEOPLE

233
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:55,800
STILL ARE.

234
00:05:55,867 --> 00:05:56,567
SO I REALLY HOPE THE DNC'S

235
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:58,066
STRATEGY THIS WEEK OF WOOING

236
00:05:58,133 --> 00:05:59,333
UNDECIDED VOTERS WITH THE STAR

237
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:00,233
POWER OF JOHN KASICH AND

238
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,533
MEG WHITMAN PAYS OFF.

239
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,300
BECAUSE IF THE DEMOCRATS JUST

240
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:07,633
SPENT A WEEK WOOING CONSERVATIVE

241
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,967
WHO ULTIMATELY END

242
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:10,076
UP VOTING REPUBLICAN, THEN THIS

243
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:10,900
WILL HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE

244
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:11,800
A DEPRESSINGLY CONVENTIONAL

245
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:12,433
CONVENTION.

246
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,767
AND NOW THIS.

247
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:18,934
Announcer: AND NOW...

248
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,033
YES, IT'S STILL AUGUST, BUT

249
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,567
GUESS WHO'S BACK?

250
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,400
PUMPKIN SPICE SEASON IS

251
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:26,643
STARTING EARLIER THAN EVER THIS

252
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:26,800
YEAR.

253
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:28,367
I FEEL LIKE EVERY YEAR, IT GETS

254
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:31,200
EARLIER AND EARLIER.

255
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,166
PUMPKIN SPICE SEASON HAS COME

256
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:34,600
EARLIER AND IS COMING FOR THE

257
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:37,100
REMAINS OF YOUR FRAGILE PSYCHE!

258
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:40,767
WE ALL KNOW PUMPKIN SPICE

259
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,166
SEASON, IT IS INEVITABLE.

260
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:45,367
IS INEVITABLE!

261
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:47,333
YOU SHALL BE CRADLED IN THE

262
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,333
FRAGMENT PUMPKIN ARMS OF THE

263
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:48,633
SPICE!

264
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,266
IF YOU WANT TO GO BUY A

265
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,700
PUMPKIN COFFEE, DO IT.

266
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:53,433
DO IT.

267
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,433
DO IT!

268
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,200
DO IT!

269
00:06:57,266 --> 00:06:58,834
ARE YOU PUMPKIN SPICE?

270
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,233
I'M NOT.

271
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,433
NO, I'M NOT EITHER.

272
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,767
WE JUST WANT THE REGULAR

273
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:04,033
COFFEE.

274
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,800
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT!

275
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:08,433
REGULAR COFFEE LIKE THE PRECIOUS

276
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,000
THOUGHTS OF A MARBLE FRIEND IS

277
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:11,767
NOT LIKE A VIVID MEMORY!

278
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:13,200
I HAVE NEVER HAD A PUMPKIN

279
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,467
SPICE LATTE.

280
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:18,200
IT IS REALLY GOOD.

281
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:21,066
OH, MY GOD, IT IS SO FUCKING

282
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:21,266
GOOD!

283
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,467
YOU HAVE TO TRY IT!

284
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:24,800
JILL!

285
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:27,200
EVERY YEAR, PEOPLE WHO LIKE

286
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:29,467
PUMPKIN SPICE KIND OF GET MADE

287
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:30,166
FUN OF.

288
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:31,066
YES, THEY DO.

289
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:32,967
2020 HAS BEEN, MIGHT I SAY,

290
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:37,967
HE DUM DUMPSTER FIRE.

291
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:39,767
LET THEM HAVE THE PUMPKIN SPICE.

292
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,934
PUMPKIN SPICE IS ALL WE HAVE

293
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,066
LEFT!

294
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,667
John: MOVING ON.

295
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:48,300
FOR OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT,

296
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,867
WE THOUGHT WE'D LOOK AT

297
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:52,734
THE BORDER WALL.

298
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,000
ONE OF THE MORE DEPRESSING

299
00:07:57,066 --> 00:08:00,367
THINGS FROM 2016, TIED WITH THE

300
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:02,900
REBOOT OF "GILMORE GIRLS CLOSE."

301
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:04,100
WHO WAS PAUL?

302
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,033
NOT ENOUGH PARIS.

303
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,800
WINDED BOTH OF THESE WOMEN

304
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:11,000
FORGET?

305
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:16,867
WHO THE ABSOLUTE FUCK WAS PAUL?

306
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:24,333
#TeamLoganForLife.

307
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,200
IT WAS THE KEY PROMISE OF

308
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:26,200
TRUMP'S FIRST CAMPAIGN.

309
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:27,309
HE TALKED ABOUT IT CONSTANTLY,

310
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,400
EVEN FAMOUSLY MANAGING TO

311
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:28,967
INADVERTENTLY POINT OUT KEY

312
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:29,633
FLAWS IN THE IDEA, LIKE THIS:

313
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,600
THERE'S NO LADDER GOING

314
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:31,133
OVER THAT.

315
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,800
IF THEY EVER GET UP THERE,

316
00:08:31,867 --> 00:08:32,876
THEY'RE IN TROUBLE, BECAUSE

317
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,400
THERE'S NO WAY TO GET DOWN.

318
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:33,834
MAYBE A ROPE.

319
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,734
John: YEAH, MAYBE A ROPE.

320
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,367
THAT WAS TRUMP, RECOGNIZING IN

321
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:36,100
REAL TIME THAT HIS SIGNATURE

322
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,242
PLAN COULD BE COMPLETELY UNDONE

323
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,934
BY THICK STRING.

324
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,367
IF THAT CLIP'S FAMILIAR TO YOU,

325
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:41,367
IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE WE PLAYED IT

326
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:43,200
IN OUR FIRST PIECE ON THE WALL

327
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:44,734
FOUR YEARS AGO, WHEN I WAS

328
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,600
APPROXIMATELY 50 YEARS YOUNGER.

329
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:48,776
AND IN THAT SHOW, WE DISCUSSED

330
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,266
HOW THE WALL SEEMED... IN

331
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:49,900
ADDITION TO BEING TRANSPARENTLY

332
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:51,300
RACIST... LIKE IT WAS GOING TO

333
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:52,476
BE BOTH EXPENSIVE AND POINTLESS.

334
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,667
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE

335
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:54,974
NOTICED, BUT TRUMP IS PRESIDENT

336
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,767
NOW, AND HAS SPENT THE LAST

337
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:57,367
THREE AND A HALF YEARS PUTTING

338
00:08:57,433 --> 00:08:59,066
HIS PLAN INTO ACTION.

339
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:00,000
IN FACT, JUST BEFORE THE

340
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:02,433
PANDEMIC, HE WAS REASSURING

341
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,233
ATTENDEES AT A RALLY THAT THINGS

342
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,734
WERE GOING GREAT.

343
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,300
WE'LL SOON BE BUILDING MANY

344
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:08,476
MANY MILES A WEEK, BUT WE'RE UP

345
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,000
TO OVER 125.

346
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:13,176
I GUESS, 127 OR 28 MILES OF THIS

347
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,500
SUPER-DUPER WALL, SUPER-DUPER.

348
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:20,266
John: I'M SORRY,

349
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:20,867
"THE SUPER-DUPER WALL?"

350
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:21,767
THAT SOUNDS LESS LIKE A

351
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:23,033
DESCRIPTION OF BORDER FENCING

352
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,633
AND MORE LIKE THE NAME OF AN

353
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,600
OFF-BRAND PLAY SET RECALLED

354
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:25,266
BECAUSE IT COLLAPSED ON A BUNCH

355
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,266
OF SMALL CHILDREN.

356
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:26,834
LISTEN TO ME!

357
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,300
DO NOT BUY "THE SUPER-DUPER

358
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:28,500
WALL!"

359
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:29,133
UNLESS YOU WANT TO WIND UP WITH

360
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,343
A PILE OF CRACKED FIBERGLASS AND

361
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,700
A FLATTENED TODDLER.

362
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:32,910
BUT CLEARLY, THE WALL IS BY NO

363
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:34,100
MEANS SUPER-DUPER.

364
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,600
AND WHILE WE PREDICTED THE WHOLE

365
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:36,934
THING WOULD BE A SHAMBLES,

366
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,500
THE EXTENT TO WHICH THAT'S BEEN

367
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:40,033
TRUE, EVEN WE DIDN'T SEE COMING.

368
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,033
TAKE WHAT HAPPENED JUST THIS

369
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,734
THURSDAY.

370
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,467
STEVE BANNON AND THREE OTHERS

371
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,300
ARE ACCUSED OF DEFRAUDING

372
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:48,100
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

373
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,333
BY PERSONALLY PROFITING OFF

374
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,800
ASCHEME TO RAISE MONEY TO HELP

375
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:52,300
BUILD PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

376
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:53,133
BORDER WALL.

377
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,867
John: YEAH, STEVE BANNON,

378
00:09:54,934 --> 00:09:56,500
THE PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER

379
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:57,400
AND FORMER CHIEF STRATEGIST,

380
00:09:57,467 --> 00:09:58,266
WAS ARRESTED!

381
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,500
WHICH IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS

382
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:00,600
YOU KNEW WOULD EVENTUALLY

383
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:01,767
HAPPEN, BUT ARE PLEASANTLY

384
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,066
SURPRISED THAT IT HAPPENED SO

385
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:04,533
SOON, LIKE JENNIFER LAWRENCE'S

386
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,100
OSCAR WIN, OR ROGER AILES'

387
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,667
DEATH.

388
00:10:06,734 --> 00:10:08,800
AND THE STORY BEHIND THAT ARREST

389
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:10,333
IS ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING, AND I

390
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,500
PROMISE WE'LL GET INTO IT LATER

391
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:13,600
IN THIS PIECE.

392
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:14,467
BUT WE THOUGHT TONIGHT...

393
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:15,233
ESPECIALLY AHEAD OF THE RNC

394
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,033
NEXT WEEK... IT'D BE A GOOD TIME

395
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,333
TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON THE

396
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,633
STATUS OF TRUMP'S BORDER WALL.

397
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,066
BECAUSE BEFORE HE TOOK OFFICE,

398
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:21,276
HE WANTED IT TO DEFINE HIM AS

399
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,567
A PRESIDENT.

400
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:24,300
AND THAT HAS VERY MUCH HAPPENED,

401
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,600
BUT IN NONE OF THE WAYS

402
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,667
THAT HE INTENDED.

403
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,567
SO LET'S TRY AND BREAK DOWN

404
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:29,967
A FEW THINGS: WHAT HE'S BUILT,

405
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:30,734
WHAT DAMAGE IT'S DONE, AND

406
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,810
CRUCIALLY, WHO'S BEEN DOING

407
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:33,433
SOME OF THE BUILDING.

408
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,509
AND LET'S START WITH WHAT,

409
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,834
EXACTLY, HE HAS BUILT.

410
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,910
BECAUSE FROM THE START, TRUMP

411
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:38,333
INSISTED THAT HE WANTED A

412
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,533
CONCRETE WALL... SOMETHING MANY

413
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,776
BORDER PATROL AGENTS HAD ADVISED

414
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,333
HIM AGAINST BECAUSE IT WOULD

415
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,476
BLOCK THEIR VIEW OF WHAT WAS

416
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,567
GOING ON BEHIND IT.

417
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:47,533
YET TRUMP WAS STILL SO INSISTENT

418
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,876
ON IT THAT LESS THAN A YEAR INTO

419
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,667
HIS TERM, THIS HAPPENED.

420
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:53,600
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE

421
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:54,367
WANTED A BIG, FAT BEAUTIFUL

422
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:55,300
WALL.

423
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:56,533
THESE ARE HIS 30 BY 30 FOOT

424
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,934
OPTIONS.

425
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,109
ONE OF THESE EIGHT CONTESTANTS

426
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:02,667
COULD SOON STRETCH ACROSS THE

427
00:11:02,734 --> 00:11:03,000
BORDER.

428
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:04,142
THERE'S A CHANCE THAT ONE OF

429
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,967
THEM GETS... ONE OF THEM GETS

430
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,667
ELECTED, EIGHT OF THEM GET

431
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:08,567
SELECTED, OR A MIX OF THEIR

432
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:09,433
CHARACTERISTICS GET SELECTED FOR

433
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,767
CONSTRUCTION.

434
00:11:11,867 --> 00:11:12,433
John: YEAH, TRUMP ESSENTIALLY

435
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,600
ORGANIZED A WALL PAGEANT.

436
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:15,333
AND LOOK, IF YOU'RE GOING TO

437
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,533
HOLD A WEIRD CONTEST IN THE

438
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,800
MIDDLE OF THE DESERT, AT LEAST

439
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:19,233
MAKE IT SAUDI ARABIA'S ACTUAL

440
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,667
BEAUTY PAGEANT FOR CAMELS.

441
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:23,066
A REAL, ANNUAL EVENT WHERE THE

442
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:24,309
HOTTEST CAMELS ARE EVALUATED ON

443
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,533
THE "FULLNESS OF THEIR LIPS,

444
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,800
HOW GRACEFULLY THEY WALK, AND

445
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:27,867
THE SIZE OF THEIR HUMPS."

446
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,109
AND YOU MIGHT BE THINKING, "WOW,

447
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:30,033
IT'S PRETTY PROBLEMATIC TO

448
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,367
OBJECTIFY CAMELS LIKE THAT,"

449
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:33,609
BUT THE FACT IS, THIS CONTEST IS

450
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:35,266
ACTUALLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST

451
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,066
SCHOLARSHIP OPPORTUNITIES THEY

452
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:37,233
HAVE.

453
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,934
AND DO YOU REALLY THINK NOW IS

454
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,042
THE TIME TO ARGUE WE NEED FEWER

455
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,000
CAMELS IN STEM?

456
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:41,633
OF COURSE NOT.

457
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,600
GET REAL.

458
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:43,934
BE AN ALLY.

459
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,467
BUT IT'S TRUE.

460
00:11:45,533 --> 00:11:47,867
EIGHT PROTOTYPES WERE BUILT, SO

461
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:49,134
THEY COULD TEST THEM TO FIGURE

462
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,600
OUT WHICH WOULD WORK BEST.

463
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,100
AND IT DIDN'T GO WELL.

464
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,567
A GOVERNMENT REPORT FOUND EVERY

465
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:55,300
MOCK-UP WAS "DEEMED VULNERABLE

466
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:56,066
TO AT LEAST ONE BREACHING

467
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,667
TECHNIQUE," WITH ONE HAVING

468
00:11:57,734 --> 00:11:58,767
THE "POTENTIAL TO IMPACT

469
00:11:58,834 --> 00:11:59,876
THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF

470
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,633
THE ENTIRE MOCK-UP."

471
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,967
WHICH IS RIDICULOUS.

472
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:04,734
WE ALL KNOW, THE ONLY WALL THAT

473
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,867
SHOULD BE IN DANGER OF

474
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:06,367
COLLAPSING IS THE

475
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:07,433
"SUPER-DUPER WALL!"

476
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,576
I'M SERIOUS... DO NOT BUY THAT

477
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,867
WALL!

478
00:12:09,934 --> 00:12:11,100
IT WILL SQUISH YOUR CHILD

479
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,100
LIKE A PANINI.

480
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,633
SO THE DESIGN THEY ENDED UP

481
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,633
GOING WITH WAS A WALL OF SLATS,

482
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,166
OR BOLLARDS, TOPPED BY A METAL

483
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:19,266
ANTI-CLIMBING PLATE.

484
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,033
AND TRUMP DID NOT LIKE THAT,

485
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,700
REPORTEDLY TELLING OFFICIALS

486
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:23,400
"HE THINKS IT'S UGLY."

487
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25,834
AND I HAVE TO SAY... HE'S NOT

488
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,300
ACTUALLY WRONG THERE.

489
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:28,266
I DON'T MEAN TO WALL-SHAME,

490
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,433
BUT IF I HAD A LIST OF HOT

491
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,333
WALLS, THAT ONE WOULDN'T CRACK

492
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,033
THE TOP 30.

493
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,700
THIS STONE WALL?

494
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:33,700
SCORCHING HOT.

495
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:34,934
THIS WOODEN ONE?

496
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,900
CALL ME TOMORROW, YOU BIG,

497
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,100
TEASE.

498
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:42,433
THIS HUMAN WALL?

499
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,934
I THINK WE ALL KNOW I FEEL ABOUT

500
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,367
THAT.

501
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:45,433
COLLAPSE ON MY CHEST,

502
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:46,667
YOU IMPENETRABLE BARRIER.

503
00:12:46,734 --> 00:12:47,233
CRUSH MY RIB CAGE, YOU

504
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,033
LOAD-BEARING BEHEMOTH.

505
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,200
BUT THIS BORDER WALL?

506
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:53,734
NO, THANK YOU.

507
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,700
THAT'S A HARD PASS FROM BOTH ME

508
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:56,433
AND THE PRESIDENT.

509
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:56,967
STILL, TRUMP INSISTS THAT

510
00:12:57,033 --> 00:12:57,867
REGARDLESS OF HOW IT LOOKS,

511
00:12:57,934 --> 00:12:58,834
THE IMPORTANT THING IS,

512
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,133
IT WORKS.

513
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,500
WE ACTUALLY BUILT PROTOTYPES

514
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:04,000
AND WE HAVE, I GUESS YOU COULD

515
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:04,867
SAY, WORLD-CLASS MOUNTAIN

516
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:05,667
CLIMBERS.

517
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:07,633
WE GOT CLIMBERS.

518
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,567
WE HAD 20 MOUNTAIN

519
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:09,333
CLIMBERS... THAT'S ALL THEY DO,

520
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,300
THEY LOVE TO CLIMB MOUNTAINS.

521
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:11,500
THEY CAN HAVE IT.

522
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:13,033
ME, I DON'T WANT TO CLIMB

523
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,867
MOUNTAINS.

524
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:14,767
BUT THEY'RE VERY GOOD.

525
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:16,074
AND SOME OF 'EM WERE CHAMPIONS.

526
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:17,233
AND WE GAVE THEM DIFFERENT

527
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,033
PROTOTYPES OF WALLS.

528
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:19,867
AND THIS WAS THE ONE THAT WAS

529
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:20,934
HARDEST TO CLIMB.

530
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,900
John: OKAY, HOLD ON.

531
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,076
THERE'S NO NEED FOR TRUMP TO SAY

532
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:24,700
"I DON'T WANT TO CLIMB

533
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:26,200
MOUNTAINS."

534
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:27,667
THAT WAS... AND I CANNOT STRESS

535
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:29,100
THIS ENOUGH... ASSUMED.

536
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,433
IF I KNEW NOTHING ELSE ABOUT

537
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,800
DONALD TRUMP, BASED SOLELY ON

538
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:32,700
HIS APPEARANCE, I'D IMMEDIATELY

539
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:33,767
MAKE THREE ASSUMPTIONS:

540
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:34,533
BAD KNEES.

541
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,367
WEIRD DICK.

542
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:36,713
DOESN'T WANT TO CLIMB MOUNTAINS.

543
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:37,807
HE'S GIVING ME INFORMATION

544
00:13:37,834 --> 00:13:38,900
I ALREADY HAVE.

545
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:41,633
AND OBVIOUSLY, THAT CLAIM IS

546
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,800
BULLSHIT, NOT JUST BECAUSE

547
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:44,667
NOBODY'S BEEN ABLE TO FIND THOSE

548
00:13:44,734 --> 00:13:45,810
CHAMPION CLIMBERS, BUT ALSO

549
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:47,033
BECAUSE OF THIS:

550
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,500
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS CALLED

551
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:49,233
THESE REFURBISHED WALLS

552
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,000
UNCLIMBABLE.

553
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,734
BUT THIS VIDEO POSTED JUST

554
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,367
YESTERDAY ON SOCIAL MEDIA SHOWS

555
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,300
TWO MEN SCALING A REPLACED

556
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:57,300
PORTION OF THE WALL IN

557
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:59,033
CALIFORNIA.

558
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,867
John: YEAH, OF COURSE!

559
00:14:00,934 --> 00:14:02,834
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED A ROPE IF IT

560
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,976
CAN FUNCTION LIKE A FIREMAN'S

561
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,433
POLE.

562
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,367
SO TO RECAP WHAT WE'VE LEARNED

563
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:07,100
ABOUT WALLS SO FAR: FUCKABLE.

564
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:07,633
DEFINITELY FUCKABLE.

565
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:12,567
AND VERY MUCH CLIMBABLE.

566
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:13,233
SO THAT IS WHAT THE WALL

567
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:13,767
LOOKS LIKE.

568
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:15,433
THE NEXT QUESTION IS WHERE,

569
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,000
EXACTLY, ARE WE BUILDING IT?

570
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:16,633
WELL, AS WE POINTED OUT IN OUR

571
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,200
FIRST PIECE, FINDING PLACES

572
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:17,967
WHERE YOU CAN BUILD THE WALL IS

573
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:19,300
A BIT OF A CHALLENGE.

574
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:20,066
UNDER PRESIDENTS CLINTON, BUSH,

575
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:21,567
AND OBAMA, HUNDREDS OF MILES OF

576
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:23,367
BORDER BARRIER HAD ALREADY BEEN

577
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:24,233
CONSTRUCTED, AND MUCH OF THE

578
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:25,200
REST OF THE BORDER IS ALREADY

579
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:26,800
COVERED BY NATURAL BARRIERS,

580
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,433
OR IS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.

581
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,700
SO WHAT TRUMP DID WAS START

582
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:31,467
BUILDING IN THE PLACES WHERE IT

583
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:32,700
WAS EASIEST TO DO THAT...

584
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:33,500
SPECIFICALLY, WHERE BARRIERS

585
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:35,066
WERE ALREADY IN PLACE.

586
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:37,467
IN FACT, OF THE 275 MILES OF

587
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:39,300
NEW WALL TRUMP HAS COMPLETED

588
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:41,200
TO DATE, ONLY FIVE MILES ARE IN

589
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:42,346
LOCATIONS WHERE NO BARRIERS

590
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,100
AT ALL PREVIOUSLY EXISTED.

591
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,333
IT MAY BE TEMPTING TO THINK,

592
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,633
"OH, WELL, THEN HE HASN'T DONE

593
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,066
VERY MUCH, HAS HE?"

594
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:49,767
BUT TRUMP'S ACTING SECRETARY OF

595
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:50,876
HOMELAND SECURITY, A MAN NAMED

596
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,500
CHAD WOLF, PUSHES BACK ON THAT

597
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:53,800
CLAIM, HARD.

598
00:14:53,867 --> 00:14:54,667
AND YOU PUT UP WHAT'S BEHIND

599
00:14:54,734 --> 00:14:55,300
US.

600
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:56,667
THAT'S NOT REPLACEMENT WALL.

601
00:14:56,734 --> 00:14:57,200
THAT IS A NEW WALL.

602
00:14:57,266 --> 00:14:58,066
THAT IS A NEW PHYSICAL

603
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,800
INFRASTRUCTURE.

604
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:01,367
I JUST... I DON'T... I DON'T

605
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,066
AGREE WITH THE ASSERTION THAT

606
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:04,700
WE'RE SIMPLY REPLACING WALL.

607
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:05,943
John: OKAY, FIRST, LET'S DEAL

608
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:07,176
WITH THE SHEER "CHAD WOLF" -INESS

609
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,400
OF THIS MAN.

610
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:09,800
IF I LOST ALL OF MY MEMORIES AND

611
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:10,943
FELL INTO A COMA FOR 30 YEARS,

612
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:12,300
OPENED MY EYES, AND SAW HIM,

613
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:13,800
THE FIRST WORDS OUT OF MY MOUTH

614
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:14,467
WOULD BE, "YOU MUST BE

615
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:16,333
CHAD WOLF."

616
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,409
HE LOOKS LIKE THE MODEL FOR A

617
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:19,166
KNOCKOFF "TOP GUN" COSTUME

618
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:20,767
YOU FIND AT PARTY CITY CALLED,

619
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:21,533
"TOP FLIGHT FAST PILOT COSTUME:

620
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,400
USA!"

621
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:23,333
HE LOOKS LIKE HIS PARENTS

622
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:23,900
STARTED WITH THE NAME

623
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:25,333
"CHAD WOLF" AND THEN FOUND

624
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,867
A BABY TO MATCH.

625
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:29,834
BUT HE IS ACTUALLY RIGHT THERE.

626
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,333
THE REPLACEMENT WALL IS

627
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,233
A COMPLETELY NEW PHYSICAL

628
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,233
INFRASTRUCTURE.

629
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,443
I'LL SHOW YOU: HERE'S THE OLD

630
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:36,567
BARRIER IN A SECTION OF

631
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:40,934
ARIZONA.

632
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,667
HERE IS THE NEW STRUCTURE.

633
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:42,567
THOSE ARE VERY DIFFERENT.

634
00:15:42,633 --> 00:15:44,033
CLAIMING THAT THEY'RE THE SAME

635
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,734
BECAUSE THEY'RE TECHNICALLY

636
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,633
BARRIERS IS LIKE CLAIMING THAT

637
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,333
JOHN CENA AND I ARE THE SAME

638
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,200
BECAUSE WE'RE THE EXACT SAME

639
00:15:47,266 --> 00:15:48,667
AGE AND WE'RE BOTH NAMED JOHN.

640
00:15:48,734 --> 00:15:50,300
SURE, YEAH, ON PAPER, THERE ARE

641
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:50,700
SOME SIMILARITIES.

642
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:51,333
BUT WHEN YOU COMPARE THE TWO

643
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,266
SIDE BY SIDE, ONE IS GIGANTIC,

644
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:52,967
AND THE OTHER LOOKS LIKE IT

645
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:53,867
MIGHT COLLAPSE IF YOU PRESS ON

646
00:15:53,934 --> 00:15:55,200
IT TOO HARD.

647
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:56,633
BUT, CRUCIALLY, THESE MASSIVE

648
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,033
NEW BARRIERS ARE CAUSING

649
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,633
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS, DISRUPTING

650
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,533
ANIMALS' MIGRATORY PATTERNS, AND

651
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,734
SLICING UP PEOPLE'S LAND.

652
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,734
AND THE THING IS, FOR WHAT?

653
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,976
IF THIS IS ABOUT STOPPING DRUGS

654
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,009
OR PEOPLE FROM ENTERING THE

655
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:08,133
COUNTRY, IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING,

656
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,934
MOST OF THAT HAPPENS THROUGH OUR

657
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,266
PORTS OF ENTRY.

658
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,066
AND EVEN THE DEPARTMENT OF

659
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:13,000
HOMELAND SECURITY'S OWN

660
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:14,433
INSPECTOR GENERAL ISSUED

661
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,633
A SCATHING REPORT JUST LAST

662
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,940
MONTH SAYING THE ADMINISTRATION

663
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,280
"DID NOT USE A SOUND METHODOLOGY

664
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,934
TO IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE

665
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,567
INVESTMENTS IN AREAS ALONG THE

666
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:22,967
BORDER THAT WOULD BEST BENEFIT

667
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:23,867
FROM PHYSICAL BARRIERS."

668
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:24,943
IN OTHER WORDS, PUTTING WALLS

669
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:26,009
WHERE WE'VE BEEN PUTTING THEM

670
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:27,967
JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

671
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:30,867
AND IF YOU WANT TO SEE JUST HOW

672
00:16:30,934 --> 00:16:32,042
NONSENSICAL, NEW SECTIONS ARE

673
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:32,867
CURRENTLY GOING UP ALONG

674
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:33,600
THE TOP OF THESE JAGGED

675
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:34,947
MOUNTAINS IN A NATIONAL WILDLIFE

676
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,934
REFUGE, WHICH IS JUST UTTERLY

677
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,100
INSANE.

678
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,286
AND THIS IS COSTING A LOT OF

679
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,433
MONEY.

680
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,776
MEXICO, OBVIOUSLY, IS NOT PAYING

681
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
FOR THE WALL.

682
00:16:42,867 --> 00:16:44,100
INSTEAD, WE ARE, AND IN THE

683
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,567
DUMBEST WAY POSSIBLE.

684
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:48,734
SO FAR TRUMP HAS GARNERED

685
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,967
$15 BILLION OF TAXPAYER MONEY

686
00:16:50,033 --> 00:16:51,600
FOR THE WALL... BUT ONLY

687
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:52,776
$5 BILLION OF THAT WAS PROVIDED

688
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
BY CONGRESS.

689
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:55,233
TRUMP DECLARED A NATIONAL

690
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,900
EMERGENCY AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER

691
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:58,200
SO HE COULD TAP INTO PENTAGON

692
00:16:58,266 --> 00:16:59,867
ACCOUNTS FOR THE REST.

693
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:01,400
THAT REDIRECTION OF FUNDS

694
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:02,747
DIVERTED MONEY THAT HAD BEEN SET

695
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,040
ASIDE FOR THINGS LIKE REPLACING

696
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,000
AN OVERCROWDED MIDDLE SCHOOL ON

697
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:08,133
A KENTUCKY MILITARY BASE, OR

698
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,100
REPAIRING A DAYCARE FOR SERVICE

699
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:10,767
MEMBERS' CHILDREN, WHICH

700
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:11,943
REPORTEDLY SUFFERED FROM SEWAGE

701
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:12,500
BACKUPS, FLOODING, MOLD, AND

702
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:13,867
PESTS.

703
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:15,300
AND WHEN ASKED TO JUSTIFY

704
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,433
THOSE DECISIONS,

705
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,200
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM HAD

706
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:18,734
A PRETTY AMAZING RATIONALE.

707
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,200
LET'S JUST SAY FOR A MOMENT

708
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:21,443
THAT HE TOOK SOME MONEY OUT OF

709
00:17:21,467 --> 00:17:22,400
THE MILITARY CONSTRUCTION

710
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:23,533
BUDGET.

711
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,834
I WOULD SAY IT'S BETTER FOR

712
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,200
THE MIDDLE SCHOOL KIDS

713
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:27,367
IN KENTUCKY TO HAVE

714
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:29,000
A SECURE BORDER.

715
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:32,600
WE'LL GET THEM THE SCHOOL THEY

716
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:33,400
NEED, BUT RIGHT NOW, WE'VE GOT

717
00:17:33,467 --> 00:17:34,000
A NATIONAL EMERGENCY ON OUR

718
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:34,567
HANDS.

719
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:35,734
John: WOW.

720
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,600
EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT IS BAD.

721
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,333
FROM THE IDEA THAT TRUMP'S

722
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,266
NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION

723
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:40,800
WAS JUSTIFIED... WHICH IT

724
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:41,867
WASN'T.

725
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:43,066
TO THE IDEA THAT HIS VANITY

726
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:44,242
PROJECT IS "BETTER FOR MIDDLE

727
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:45,000
SCHOOL KIDS" THAN A NEW SCHOOL,

728
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:46,867
WHICH IT'S NOT.

729
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:48,233
TO THAT TIE, WHICH LOOKS LIKE

730
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:48,900
A CANDY CANE THAT MELTED ON HIS

731
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,300
SHIRT.

732
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:51,433
IT LOOKS LIKE THE TIE THAT

733
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,066
SANTA CLAUS WEARS TO

734
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:52,967
ELF FUNERALS.

735
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:54,433
IT'S THE WORST THING IN THAT

736
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,740
SHOT, WHICH IS SAYING SOMETHING

737
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,876
BECAUSE THAT SHOT ALSO INCLUDES

738
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,400
LINDSEY GRAHAM.

739
00:17:58,467 --> 00:17:59,643
AND THAT BRINGS US TO OUR FINAL

740
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:01,633
QUESTION: WHO'S BUILDING THIS?

741
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,266
BECAUSE THE ANSWERS TO THAT ARE

742
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,033
ACTUALLY A LITTLE SURPRISING.

743
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,233
JUST LOOK AT ONE OF THE

744
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,000
COMPANIES THAT WAS INVITED TO

745
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:08,633
TAKE PART IN THAT AMERICA'S NEXT

746
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,266
TOP WALL IN THE DESERT

747
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,000
COMPETITION,

748
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:11,734
FISHER SAND & GRAVEL.

749
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,867
THE HEAD OF THE COMPANY,

750
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:14,367
TOMMY FISHER, KNOWS HOW TO CURRY

751
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:15,533
FAVOR WITH TRUMP.

752
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,233
HERE HE IS ON LAURA INGRAHAM'S

753
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,333
SHOW, GIVING HIM THE HARD SELL.

754
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,700
IF HE ALLOWS US TO PLAY IN,

755
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,047
OUR TEAM OF FISHER INDUSTRIES TO

756
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,200
PLAY, I GUARANTEE YOU, NO

757
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:27,300
DIFFERENT THAN TOM BRADY, ONCE

758
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:28,266
WE GET IN, WE NEVER COME OUT.

759
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,433
AND IF WE DON'T PERFORM,

760
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,367
THE PRESIDENT CAN FIRE US,

761
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:31,609
AND THAT'S HOW COMFORTABLE AND

762
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:32,166
CONFIDENT I AM IS WHEN PEOPLE

763
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:32,700
SEE WHAT WE REALLY OFFER.

764
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:33,367
I LOVE IT!

765
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:34,300
I LOVE IT.

766
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,527
I'M NOT TAKING SIDES ON WHICH

767
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:36,433
PROTOTYPE IS BEST, BUT THIS IS

768
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,033
WHY YOU'RE A GOOD BUSINESSMAN.

769
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,500
John: "I LOVE IT!"

770
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:40,727
I DIDN'T THINK LAURA INGRAHAM

771
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,166
WAS CAPABLE OF THAT LEVEL OF

772
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:43,343
DELIGHT, BUT IT TURNS OUT HER

773
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:44,600
LOVE LANGUAGE IS WHITE MEN

774
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:45,900
BEGGING FOR ATTENTION.

775
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:47,233
BECAUSE THAT MAN IS THIRSTY

776
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,934
AS FUCK.

777
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,400
"I'LL WIN FOR YOU, DADDY, JUST

778
00:18:51,467 --> 00:18:52,543
LIKE THAT TOM BRADY YOU LIKE!

779
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:55,066
AND IF I DON'T, YOU CAN FIRE ME

780
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,467
LIKE YOU USED TO ON TV."

781
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:57,333
AND THAT WAS, BY NO MEANS,

782
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,680
FISHER'S ONLY APPEARANCE ON FOX.

783
00:18:58,734 --> 00:19:00,333
HE WENT ON THE NETWORK TEN TIMES

784
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,476
TO PRAISE THE PRESIDENT AND SELL

785
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,867
HIS WALL.

786
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,867
AND THESE APPEARANCES SEEMED TO

787
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:06,066
HAVE AN EFFECT.

788
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:07,734
BECAUSE WHILE BOTH DHS AND THE

789
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,009
ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS ACTUALLY

790
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:10,042
TURNED DOWN FISHER'S INITIAL

791
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:10,667
WALL DESIGNS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T

792
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:12,133
MEET OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS,

793
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,333
FISHER'S COMPANY WAS

794
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,767
NEVERTHELESS ADDED TO A SMALL

795
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:16,633
LIST OF PRE-APPROVED BIDDERS

796
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,910
THANKS TO PERSONAL PRESSURE FROM

797
00:19:17,934 --> 00:19:19,174
THE PRESIDENT, WHO... ACCORDING

798
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,333
TO ONE OF THE SENATORS FROM

799
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,233
FISHER'S HOME STATE... LIKED

800
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,233
FISHER BECAUSE HE HAD SEEN HIM

801
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,233
ON TELEVISION.

802
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,367
AND OF COURSE HE DID!

803
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:27,266
TRUMP IS LIKE A SHUT-IN WHO SITS

804
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,767
AT HOME ALL DAY AND ORDERS WHAT

805
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:31,433
HE SEES ON FOX, BUT INSTEAD OF

806
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,200
ORDERING LEGENDZ XL MALE

807
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:34,500
ENHANCEMENT PILLS, HE PICKS

808
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:35,834
COMPANIES TO BUILD A GIANT WALL

809
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,667
ACROSS THE BORDER.

810
00:19:36,734 --> 00:19:38,834
BUT JUST AS WITH BONER PILLS,

811
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,976
YOU SHOULDN'T JUST BUY SOMETHING

812
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,367
BECAUSE YOU SAW IT ON TV.

813
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:42,166
YOU MIGHT WANT TO AT LEAST

814
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:44,033
GOOGLE IT FIRST.

815
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:45,142
BECAUSE FISHER'S COMPANY HAD

816
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,567
A LOT OF OBVIOUS RED FLAGS.

817
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:49,000
FISHER HAS BEEN HIT WITH

818
00:19:49,066 --> 00:19:50,109
LAWSUITS, ONE FROM THE FEDERAL

819
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:51,367
GOVERNMENT FOR SEXUAL

820
00:19:51,433 --> 00:19:53,400
DISCRIMINATION IN NEW MEXICO.

821
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:54,834
IT SETTLED FOR 150 GRAND.

822
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,300
THE COMPANY AND THE FOUNDER'S

823
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:57,200
SON WERE BOTH ACCUSED OF

824
00:19:57,266 --> 00:19:59,133
TAX FRAUD IN 2009.

825
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,633
THE SON PLEADED GUILTY,

826
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,300
THE COMPANY PAID MORE THAN A

827
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,066
MILLION IN BACK TAXES.

828
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:03,834
John: WOW.

829
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,042
SO THEY CHEATED TO GET AHEAD,

830
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:05,934
GOT CAUGHT, AND YET, THEY'RE

831
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,700
STILL AROUND.

832
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:09,233
THEY REALLY ARE THE TOM BRADY OF

833
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,967
THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY.

834
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:12,333
BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE, BECAUSE

835
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,667
OVER THE YEARS, THEY'VE ALSO

836
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:15,367
RACKED UP AROUND 2,000 VIOLATION

837
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:16,533
NOTICES FROM CITY, COUNTY,

838
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,967
STATE, AND FEDERAL REGULATORY

839
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:20,867
BODIES, INCLUDING 469 CRIMINAL

840
00:20:20,934 --> 00:20:22,200
CHARGES FOR VIOLATIONS IN

841
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:23,967
PHOENIX, WHERE THE COMPANY RAN

842
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:25,313
AN ASPHALT PLANT... CHARGES ONLY

843
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:26,667
REDUCED TO CIVIL PENALTIES AFTER

844
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:27,266
FISHER AGREED TO PERMANENTLY

845
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:27,934
CLOSE IT.

846
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
BUT WAIT... I'M NOT DONE.

847
00:20:30,066 --> 00:20:31,867
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE REJECTED

848
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:35,233
THEIR BIDS ON CONTRACTS DUE TO

849
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,233
EVEN MORE SKETCHY DETAILS FROM

850
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,133
THEIR PAST, INCLUDING THE FACT

851
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,600
THE FORMER HEAD OF THEIR FAMILY

852
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:39,266
OF COMPANIES, FISHER INDUSTRIES,

853
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:39,934
WAS CONVICTED FOR

854
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,900
CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.

855
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:41,600
AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT,

856
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:42,776
TAX FRAUD, FEDERAL VIOLATIONS,

857
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,734
AND CHILD PORNOGRAPHY IS NOT A

858
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,700
GREAT LIST FOR A COMPANY VYING

859
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:49,333
TO RECEIVE GOVERNMENT MONEY,

860
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,000
IT'S NOT EVEN A GREAT LIST FOR

861
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,767
THE "OZARK" SEASON FOUR WRITER'S

862
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:53,834
ROOM.

863
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,633
GUYS, GUYS, THAT'S TOO MUCH.

864
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,967
NOT EVEN JASON BATEMAN CAN MAKE

865
00:20:57,033 --> 00:20:58,734
THOSE CRIMES LIKEABLE!

866
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,633
AND YET, FISHER WAS INCREDIBLY

867
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,776
SAVVY ABOUT HOW TO APPEAL TO

868
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,066
TRUMP... NOT JUST WITH HIS

869
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:05,467
CONSTANT TV APPEARANCES, BUT

870
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:06,576
ALSO BY HOOKING UP WITH "WE

871
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,967
BUILD THE WALL"... THAT IS THE

872
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,333
NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT

873
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,967
LED TO STEVE BANNON'S ARREST

874
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:12,266
ON THURSDAY.

875
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,433
IT WAS FOUNDED BY A VETERAN

876
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,800
NAMED BRIAN KOLFAGE, AND IT TOOK

877
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:16,300
MONEY FROM INDIVIDUAL DONORS,

878
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:17,266
WITH THE PROMISE THAT IT WOULD

879
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,567
BUILD NEW SECTIONS OF WALL ON

880
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:19,433
PRIVATE LAND.

881
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,266
IT EVEN HAD A FUNDRAISING

882
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,133
"WALL-A-THON," FEATURING A STAR

883
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,409
TURN FROM A MAN CALLING HIMSELF

884
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:25,667
"FOREMAN MIKE":

885
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:26,567
WE BUILD THE WALL

886
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:28,734
CONSTRUCTION.

887
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,734
THEY ARE REAL!

888
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,100
WE NEED YOUR HELP.

889
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:32,967
WE NEED TO GET DONATIONS IN.

890
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:35,333
WE WANT TO START.

891
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,266
YOU CAN BUY A BOLLARD PANEL.

892
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,633
PUT YOUR NAME ON IT FOR

893
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,333
ETERNITY, CAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA

894
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,133
LAST FOREVER.

895
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,834
$5,000.

896
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,433
AND IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT,

897
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:47,266
GET YOURSELF A BRICK.

898
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,700
IT LASTS FOREVER AS WELL WITH

899
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,667
YOUR NAME, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR

900
00:21:50,734 --> 00:21:51,910
GIRLFRIEND, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO

901
00:21:51,934 --> 00:21:52,400
PUT ON IT.

902
00:21:52,467 --> 00:21:55,066
YOU NEED TO DONATE TODAY.

903
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:55,800
John: OKAY, THERE'S A LOT TO

904
00:21:55,867 --> 00:21:56,867
DIGEST THERE.

905
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,567
BECAUSE DESPITE WHAT YOU MAY

906
00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:58,500
THINK, "FOREMAN MIKE" IS NOT

907
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,807
A PROMO FOR A NEW WWE CHARACTER

908
00:21:59,834 --> 00:22:00,667
WHOSE SIGNATURE MOVE IS

909
00:22:00,734 --> 00:22:01,533
"THE CHAOTIC SALES PITCH."

910
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,767
IN FACT, HE ISN'T EVEN THE

911
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:04,533
FOREMAN ON THE PROJECT, JUST AS

912
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,200
"WE BUILD THE WALL CONSTRUCTION"

913
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:06,306
IS NOT A REAL CONSTRUCTION

914
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,834
COMPANY.

915
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,433
HE'S JUST SOME GUY THEY USE TO

916
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,543
FUNDRAISE, SO HE CAN GRUNT ABOUT

917
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:13,000
PERSONALIZED BRICKS.

918
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:14,400
WHICH I DO ADMIT ARE A GREAT

919
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:16,233
IDEA, BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THE

920
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,540
BEST WAY TO DETER SOMEONE WHO'S

921
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,033
CROSSING THE BORDER IS FOR THEM

922
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,209
TO SEE THE MESSAGE, "TO THE ONE

923
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:22,633
AND ONLY KIERSTEN, MAY OUR LOVE

924
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,367
BE AS STRONG AS THIS WALL."

925
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:24,509
AND AS RIDICULOUS AS THAT MAY

926
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:25,200
SEEM, "WE BUILD THE WALL" RAISED

927
00:22:25,266 --> 00:22:27,300
$25 MILLION.

928
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:28,700
AND YET, ACCORDING TO THIS

929
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:30,367
WEEK'S INDICTMENT, QUITE A BIT

930
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,033
OF THAT MONEY WOUND UP GETTING

931
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,567
REDIRECTED BACK TO BANNON AND

932
00:22:33,633 --> 00:22:35,233
KOLFAGE, WHO... ALONG WITH

933
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,000
OTHERS... WORKED TOGETHER TO

934
00:22:37,066 --> 00:22:38,433
MISAPPROPRIATE HUNDREDS OF

935
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,166
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR THEIR

936
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,667
OWN PERSONAL BENEFIT.

937
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,233
WITH BANNON ALLEGEDLY USING

938
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,467
MONEY FOR PERSONAL USES AND

939
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:45,066
EXPENSES, AND KOLFAGE ALLEGEDLY

940
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:46,567
SPENDING FUNDS ON A LUXURY SUV,

941
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:48,967
A GOLF CART, JEWELRY, AND

942
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:50,867
PAYMENTS TOWARD A BOAT.

943
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:53,500
AND LOOK, BANNON AND KOLFAGE

944
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:54,567
DENY THOSE CHARGES.

945
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,643
BUT IT DEFINITELY PAINTS THIS

946
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,166
MOMENT FROM THAT "WALL-A-THON"

947
00:22:57,233 --> 00:22:57,700
IN A VERY DIFFERENT LIGHT:

948
00:22:57,767 --> 00:22:58,667
WELCOME BACK, THIS IS

949
00:22:58,767 --> 00:23:00,100
STEPHEN K. BANNON.

950
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,533
WE'RE OFF THE COAST OF

951
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,367
SAN TROPEZ IN SOUTHERN FRANCE IN

952
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:05,443
THE MEDITERRANEAN, WE'RE ON

953
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,066
THE MILLION-DOLLAR YACHT OF

954
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:08,467
BRIAN KOLFAGE... BRIAN KOLFAGE,

955
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:09,066
WHO TOOK ALL THAT MONEY FROM

956
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:10,066
BUILD THE WALL.

957
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:11,934
NO, WE'RE ACTUALLY IN

958
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,734
SUNLAND PARK, NEW MEXICO.

959
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,533
John: HA HA HA!

960
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,433
I GET IT!

961
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,500
I GET IT!

962
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:17,576
JOKING ABOUT STEALING PEOPLE'S

963
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,533
MONEY IS FUNNY!

964
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,710
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,

965
00:23:19,734 --> 00:23:20,843
ALL GREAT JOKES HAVE AN ELEMENT

966
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:23,834
OF TRUTH IN THEM.

967
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,109
NOW TRUMP WAS ANXIOUS THIS WEEK

968
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:26,600
TO DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM

969
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:27,600
"WE BUILD THE WALL," SAYING "I

970
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:28,810
KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE PROJECT,"

971
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:29,567
WHICH IS A LITTLE HARD TO

972
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:31,000
BELIEVE, BECAUSE HERE'S KOLFAGE

973
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:32,309
WITH DON, JR., AT AN EVENT WHERE

974
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:33,609
HE DESCRIBED "WE BUILD THE WALL"

975
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:34,793
AS "PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AT ITS

976
00:23:34,834 --> 00:23:35,767
FINEST."

977
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:37,100
AND HERE'S TRUMP ALLY

978
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,834
KRIS KOBACH ON THE GROUP'S OWN

979
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,940
YOUTUBE PAGE, BEING PRETTY

980
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,767
UNEQUIVOCAL ABOUT WHERE THE

981
00:23:40,834 --> 00:23:41,867
PRESIDENT STOOD.

982
00:23:41,934 --> 00:23:43,066
I WAS SPEAKING WITH THE

983
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:44,734
PRESIDENT AND WE WERE TALKING

984
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,133
ABOUT A VARIETY OF ISSUES, AND

985
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,800
THE TOPIC CAME UP... I MENTIONED

986
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:51,000
THAT I WAS WORKING WITH WE BUILD

987
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:53,500
THE WALL, AND HE SAID, WELL, YOU

988
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:55,667
TELL THE PEOPLE YOU ARE WORKING

989
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,033
WITH THAT THIS PROJECT HAS MY

990
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,233
BLESSING, AND HE WENT FURTHER,

991
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:00,934
AND HE SAID, I WANT THE MEDIA TO

992
00:24:01,033 --> 00:24:01,533
KNOW THAT THIS PROJECT HAS MY

993
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,333
BLESSING.

994
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,867
HE WAS REALLY MAKING A POINT

995
00:24:03,934 --> 00:24:05,367
THAT HE WAS BEHIND THIS.

996
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:10,567
John: YEAH, OF COURSE HE WAS!

997
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:12,033
I'M JUST SURPRISED KOBACH DIDN'T

998
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,700
CONTINUE, "THIS PRESIDENT WANTED

999
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:13,467
YOU TO KNOW HE'S COMPLETELY

1000
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:14,543
BEHIND THIS WALL SCAM UNTIL IT

1001
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:15,166
FAILS, AND THEN YOU'LL NOT BE

1002
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:16,000
ABLE TO REACH HIM AND HE WON'T

1003
00:24:16,066 --> 00:24:17,667
HAVE HEARD OF YOU.

1004
00:24:17,734 --> 00:24:18,533
THAT'S JUST HOW THE GUY WORKS."

1005
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,133
AND LOOK, TO BE FAIR, SOME OF

1006
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,800
THAT $25 MILLION THEY RAISED DID

1007
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:21,867
GO TO CONSTRUCTION.

1008
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,567
SPECIFICALLY, THEY SAY THEY GAVE

1009
00:24:23,633 --> 00:24:25,133
AROUND $10 MILLION OF IT TO

1010
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,800
TOMMY FISHER'S COMPANY, MOST OF

1011
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:28,800
IT TO BUILD THAT PRIVATE WALL

1012
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,767
IN NEW MEXICO THAT YOU SAW A GUY

1013
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:32,567
NAMED MIKE BANGING WITH A

1014
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:36,667
HAMMER.

1015
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:37,266
AND THAT WALL DOES APPEAR TO

1016
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:38,133
FEATURE SOME PERSONALIZED

1017
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,100
BRICKS, LIKE THIS ONE THAT

1018
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:39,800
KOLFAGE EXCITEDLY PUT ON

1019
00:24:39,867 --> 00:24:40,700
INSTAGRAM, WHICH SAYS,

1020
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:41,533
"THICC LATINAS WILL NOT BE

1021
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,400
DEPORTED," WHICH IS JUST FUCKING

1022
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:43,333
DISGUSTING.

1023
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,467
THE GROUP ALSO HELPED FUND

1024
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:45,934
ANOTHER FISHER WALL, BUILT

1025
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,667
DIRECTLY ALONG THE RIO GRANDE,

1026
00:24:47,734 --> 00:24:49,033
WHICH FISHER REFERRED TO AS THE

1027
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,300
LAMBORGHINI OF WALLS, CLAIMING

1028
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:51,600
THAT, "IT'LL STAND FOR

1029
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:54,233
150 YEARS, YOU MARK MY WORDS."

1030
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,834
ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS TO BE CONKING

1031
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,600
OUT AROUND 149 YEARS AHEAD OF

1032
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:58,533
SCHEDULE.

1033
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,133
A PROPUBLICA AND

1034
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,066
"TEXAS TRIBUNE" INVESTIGATION

1035
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:02,934
FOUND EROSION BENEATH

1036
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,009
THE FOUNDATION OF A STRETCH OF

1037
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:05,433
WALL IN TEXAS.

1038
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,000
THAT STRETCH WAS JUST BUILT IN

1039
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:09,300
JANUARY OF THIS YEAR BY FISHER

1040
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:12,367
SAND AND GRAVEL.

1041
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:13,543
I'M JUST DOING THIS WITH ONE

1042
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:19,967
HAND, NOT EVEN EXERTING MYSELF.

1043
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:20,734
John: OKAY, SO

1044
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,400
IT TURNS OUT, IT REALLY IS THE

1045
00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:22,467
LAMBORGHINI OF WALLS, IN

1046
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:23,467
THAT AS SOON AS YOU GET NEAR IT,

1047
00:25:23,533 --> 00:25:24,133
THE OWNER YELLS, "HEY, PLEASE

1048
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,133
DON'T TOUCH THAT, IT'LL LOSE

1049
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,467
VALUE AND YOU COULD BREAK IT."

1050
00:25:26,533 --> 00:25:27,693
AND WHILE I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

1051
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:28,333
FISHER'S ATTORNEY HAS TOLD

1052
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,600
REPORTERS THAT EROSION IS A

1053
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:33,867
NORMAL PART OF NEW CONSTRUCTION,

1054
00:25:33,934 --> 00:25:34,834
AND THAT IF THERE ARE ISSUES

1055
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,700
THAT COME UP, THEY WILL ADDRESS

1056
00:25:38,767 --> 00:25:40,667
THAT.

1057
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:41,200
EXPERTS SAID THAT IT WAS

1058
00:25:41,266 --> 00:25:43,934
CONCERNING AND THAT

1059
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
SEGMENTS OF THE STRUCTURE COULD

1060
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:46,633
TOPPLE INTO THE RIVER IF NOT

1061
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,233
FIXED.

1062
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,376
SO, TO RECAP: FISHER SAND &

1063
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,500
GRAVEL IS A COMPANY WITH A

1064
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:50,967
CHECKERED PAST THAT PARTNERED

1065
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:51,767
WITH A SHADY NONPROFIT WHOSE

1066
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:52,767
BACKERS ARE NOW UNDER INDICTMENT

1067
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:53,533
FOR SKIMMING MONEY FOR THEIR OWN

1068
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,433
USES, IN ORDER TO HAVE A FOREMAN

1069
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,333
WHO'S NOT THE ACTUAL FOREMAN

1070
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,033
HELP BUILD A WALL THAT LOOKS

1071
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,000
LIKE IT MAY EITHER COLLAPSE

1072
00:25:58,066 --> 00:25:58,433
OR GET PUSHED OVER.

1073
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,367
AND IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

1074
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:00,443
THIS ADMINISTRATION, IT WILL NOT

1075
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:01,266
SURPRISE YOU TO LEARN THAT

1076
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:02,767
FISHER HAS NOW WOUND UP WITH

1077
00:26:02,834 --> 00:26:03,874
OVER $2 BILLION DOLLARS IN

1078
00:26:03,934 --> 00:26:05,200
BORDER-BUILDING CONTRACTS.

1079
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:06,700
THEY'RE ONE OF THE BIGGEST

1080
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:08,266
CONTRACTORS THE GOVERNMENT HAS

1081
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,333
HIRED FOR THIS PROJECT.

1082
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:10,667
AND THE THING IS, SHOULD TRUMP

1083
00:26:10,734 --> 00:26:12,734
BE RE-ELECTED, ALL OF THIS IS

1084
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,943
ONLY GOING TO ACCELERATE... IN

1085
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:16,000
FACT, HIS ADMINISTRATION SEEMS

1086
00:26:16,066 --> 00:26:17,266
TO BE STEPPING UP ITS EFFORTS,

1087
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,567
ATTEMPTING TO TAKE PRIVATE LAND

1088
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:20,100
BY FILING MORE EMINENT DOMAIN

1089
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:22,100
LAWSUITS DURING THE PANDEMIC

1090
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:22,700
THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME IN HIS

1091
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:24,066
PRESIDENCY.

1092
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:24,767
AND THEY'RE ALSO USING A

1093
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:28,100
PROVISION TUCKED INTO

1094
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:29,100
THE REAL ID ACT OF 2005, GIVING

1095
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:29,734
THE ADMINISTRATION THE POWER TO

1096
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,633
WAIVE ALL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS

1097
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,066
NECESSARY TO CONSTRUCT THE WALL.

1098
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,433
AND THAT MEANS IT'S NOT BOUND

1099
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,800
BY ENVIRONMENTAL OR CULTURAL

1100
00:26:35,867 --> 00:26:37,107
HERITAGE PROTECTION LAWS, WHICH

1101
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:39,033
HAS ENABLED THEM TO PLOW THROUGH

1102
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,433
NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES,

1103
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,200
WITH DEVASTATING EFFECTS.

1104
00:26:43,266 --> 00:26:44,734
CONSTRUCTION CREWS IN

1105
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,166
SOUTHERN ARIZONA CONDUCTED

1106
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:50,567
CONTROLLED BLASTS EARLIER THIS

1107
00:26:50,633 --> 00:26:51,100
YEAR ALONG MONUMENT HILL.

1108
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:52,166
FIRE IN THE HOLE.

1109
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,033
THE SAME DAY OF THE

1110

SAT BEFORE CONGRESS.

1113
00:26:56,633 --> 00:26:58,367
IT'S HARD TO SEE THE BLASTING

1114
00:26:58,433 --> 00:26:59,734
THAT YOU SHOWED ON THE VIDEO

1115
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,033
TODAY.

1116
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,033
THAT AREA IS HOME TO OUR

1117
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,667
ANCESTORS.

1118
00:27:04,734 --> 00:27:07,834
AND BY BLASTING AND DOING WHAT

1119
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:12,166
WE SAW TODAY, HAS TOTALLY

1120
00:27:12,233 --> 00:27:13,800
DISTURBED... TOTALLY, FOREVER

1121
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:19,500
DAMAGED OUR PEOPLE.

1122
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:21,834
John: THAT'S HORRIBLE.

1123
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,567
AS THAT MAN TOLD CONGRESS, "FOR

1124
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:24,500
US, THIS IS NO DIFFERENT THAN

1125
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:25,467
DHS BUILDING A 30-FOOT WALL

1126
00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:26,934
ALONG ARLINGTON CEMETERY OR

1127
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,333
THROUGH THE GROUNDS OF THE

1128
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,033
NATIONAL CATHEDRAL."

1129
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,367
AND I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT'S

1130
00:27:31,433 --> 00:27:32,300
SOMETHING TRUMP KNOWS WOULD BE

1131
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:33,700
WRONG, BUT WHO KNOWS, GIVEN THAT

1132
00:27:33,767 --> 00:27:35,133
HE HAD PEOPLE TEARGASSED SO HE

1133
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,133
COULD STAND OUTSIDE A CHURCH,

1134
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,967
HOLDING A BIBLE WITH AN

1135
00:27:37,033 --> 00:27:37,667
EXPRESSION LIKE IT JUST FUCKED

1136
00:27:37,734 --> 00:27:39,400
HIS WIFE.

1137
00:27:39,467 --> 00:27:40,934
AND THE DEVASTATION CAUSED BY

1138
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,900
THIS WALL WAS COMPLETELY

1139
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:43,300
PREDICTABLE.

1140
00:27:43,367 --> 00:27:44,300
I KNOW THAT, BECAUSE WE

1141
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:49,133
LITERALLY PREDICTED IT.

1142
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,500
AND BELIEVE ME,

1143
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:50,400
THIS IS THE LAST THING I

1144
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:51,367
WANTED TO SAY I TOLD YOU SO ON.

1145
00:27:51,433 --> 00:27:52,576
I'D MUCH RATHER HAVE SAID THAT

1146
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,400
ABOUT THE FACT I KNEW PETE AND

1147
00:27:54,467 --> 00:27:55,509
ARIANA WEREN'T GOING TO MAKE IT

1148
00:27:55,533 --> 00:27:56,609
OR THAT A CROCKPOT WOULD BE THE

1149
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,776
KILLER ON "THIS IS US," OR THE

1150
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,876
FACT THAT I KNEW THE BABADOOK

1151
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,467
WAS GAY AS SOON AS I SAW HIM.

1152
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:04,934
C'MON, GUYS... THE HAT!

1153
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,042
BUT EVEN I DIDN'T SEE SOME OF

1154
00:28:06,066 --> 00:28:07,467
THIS COMING... FROM THE

1155
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:09,900
POINTLESSNESS OF A BEAUTY

1156
00:28:09,967 --> 00:28:11,142
CONTEST IN THE DESERT, ALL THE

1157
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:11,867
WAY THROUGH A SKETCHY CHARITY

1158
00:28:11,934 --> 00:28:13,900
SELLING PERSONALIZED BRICKS.

1159
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:15,200
ALL OF THIS WAS STUPIDER THAN

1160
00:28:15,266 --> 00:28:16,900
EVEN I THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE.

1161
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:18,333
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, THIS WALL

1162
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,266
IS NOT A FUNCTIONAL BARRIER.

1163
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,633
IF IT'S ANYTHING, IT'S A FUCKING

1164
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,867
MONUMENT TO TRUMP.

1165
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:26,767
WHICH ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE.

1166
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:28,233
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT HE'S

1167
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,066
COMPLETELY OBSESSED WITH HIS

1168
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:30,200
LEGACY.

1169
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:31,467
TRUMP REPORTEDLY EVEN ASKED

1170
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:32,543
SOUTH DAKOTA'S GOVERNOR HOW HE

1171
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:33,233
COULD BE ADDED TO

1172
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:37,433
MOUNT RUSHMORE.

1173
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,033
AND WHILE THAT IS CLEARLY NOT

1174
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,800
GOING TO HAPPEN... FOR ONE

1175
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:39,433
THING, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO CARVE

1176
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,266
STONE INTO WHATEVER FUCKING

1177
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:40,934
SHAPE HIS HAIR IS... HE ALSO

1178
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,266
DOESN'T NEED IT.

1179
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:45,266
BECAUSE THIS IS HIS MONUMENT.

1180
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:47,133
AND THERE'S PERHAPS NOTHING MORE

1181
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,100
EMBLEMATIC OF HIS PRESIDENCY

1182
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:50,500
THAN THIS WALL: IT'S

1183
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:52,133
DESTRUCTIVE, POINTLESS,

1184
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,567
INEFFECTIVE, RACIST, WEAK, AND

1185
00:28:53,633 --> 00:28:55,000
SOMETHING THE DAMAGES OF WHICH

1186
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,967
WE'RE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH

1187
00:28:57,033 --> 00:28:59,000
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

1188
00:28:59,066 --> 00:29:00,367
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

1189
00:29:00,433 --> 00:29:03,934
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

1190
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,100
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK,

1191
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:05,767
GOOD NIGHT.
