DECLINED TO INDICT ANYONE OVER

00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:44,266
THE DEATH OF BREONNA TAYLOR,

00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,834

68

THE CHARGE AND ALSO THE CITY

70
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:11,333
PAID $12 MILLION TO THE FAMILY,

71

73
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:17,500
ARE... IT'S ONLY CONTINUING, IN

74
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:18,166
MY MIND, BECAUSE THERE ARE

75
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:19,066
PEOPLE WHO HAVE THEIR OWN

76
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:23,166
AGENDA.

77
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:26,300
John: NOW, I KNOW THAT SOUNDS

78
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:26,967
AWFUL, AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS.

79
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:27,800
BUT TRY AND LOOK AT IT FROM HIS

80
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:28,300
PERSPECTIVE: THE COPS IN

81
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:29,409
QUESTION WERE INVESTIGATED, LET

82
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:30,000
OFF, AND THE VICTIM'S FAMILY WAS

83
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,226
PAID OFF WITH TAXPAYER MONEY.

84
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:32,567
FROM A FORMER POLICE OFFICER'S

85
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:34,166
POINT OF VIEW, THAT'S THE SYSTEM

86
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:36,934
WORKING AS DESIGNED...

87
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,867
AND THAT IS KIND OF THE WHOLE

88
00:02:38,934 --> 00:02:39,433
FUCKING PROBLEM HERE.

89
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,867
BUT OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT

90
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:42,433
CONCERNS THE FACT THAT, LAST

91
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,000
WEEKEND, RUTH BADER GINSBURG

92
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:43,567
DIED, WHICH WAS DISTRESSING

93
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:44,533
ENOUGH.

94
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,800
BUT IT'S BEEN COMPOUNDED BY THE

95
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:47,533
FACT THAT JUST YESTERDAY, THIS

96
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,033

THE PRESIDENT NOMINATING ANY CO.

100
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:01,200
BARRETT IS FAVORITE OF

101
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:02,476
RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES FOR HER

STRONG ANTI-ABORTION RIGHTS

103
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,333
VIEWS AND, IF CONFIRMED, WOULD

104
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,609
MOVE THE COURT TO THE RIGHT FOR

105
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:07,934
A GENERATION.

106
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,700
John: RIGHT, TRUMP IS ABOUT

107
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:09,300
TO REPLACE A LIBERAL ICON WITH

108
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:09,834
AN EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE

109
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,433
JUSTICE WHO'S BEEN CALLED THE

110
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,033
FEMALE ANTONIN SCALIA, AND SHE

111
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:11,900
COULD SERVE FOR A LONG, LONG

112
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:13,667
TIME.

113
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:14,843
AMY CONEY BARRETT IS ONLY 48,

114
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:16,266
AND I KNOW THAT I MAKE 43 LOOK

115
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,533
LIKE 76, BUT TRUST ME, THAT'S

116
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,333
YOUNG FOR A SUPREME COURT

117
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
JUSTICE.

118
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:22,473
AND LOOK, IF... AND ALMOST

119
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:23,667
CERTAINLY WHEN... BARRETT IS

120
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:24,876
CONFIRMED TO THE SUPREME COURT,

121
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,533
THE IMPACT COULD BE DIRE.

122
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,676
IN RECENT YEARS, KEY CASES HAVE

123
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:34,400
BEEN DECIDED BY JUST ONE VOTE,

124
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:35,066
FROM UPHOLDING THE AFFORDABLE

125
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:35,867
CARE ACT TO PRESERVING DACA TO

126

127

RESTRICTIVE ABORTION LAW.

128
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:38,300
SHOULD THOSE ISSUES COME BEFORE

129
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:39,266
THE COURT AGAIN, THEY COULD NOW

130
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:43,533
EASILY GO THE OTHER WAY.

131
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,133
AND THERE IS CLEARLY NO POINT

132
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,767
HOLDING ONTO HOPE THAT

133
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:45,533
CONSERVATIVES MIGHT CHOOSE TO

134
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,166
RESPECT THE PRECEDENT THEY SET

135
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:51,767
BY REFUSING TO EVEN CONSIDER

136
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:52,400
MERRICK GARLAND IN AN ELECTION

137
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:53,066
YEAR, BECAUSE THAT WAS ALWAYS IN

138
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:53,700
BAD FAITH, AS WAS OBVIOUS AT THE

139
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:54,066
TIME.

140
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,333
IN FACT, AHEAD OF THE 2016

141
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,767
ELECTION, SENATOR RICHARD BURR

142
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:57,734
EVEN PRIVATELY SAID THIS TO A

143
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,900
GROUP OF CAMPAIGN VOLUNTEERS:

144
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:03,834
IF HILLARY CLINTON BECOMES

145
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,567
PRESIDENT, I AM GOING TO DO

146
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:13,567
EVERYTHING I CAN DO TO MAKE

147
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:14,873
SURE THAT, FOUR YEARS FROM NOW,

148
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,433
WE STILL GOT AN OPENING ON THE

149
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,300
SUPREME COURT.

150
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:17,133
John: YEAH, THAT'S A

151
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,934
REPUBLICAN SENATOR COMMITTING TO

152
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,934
BLOCKING A JUSTICE CONFIRMATION,

153
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,142
NOT JUST IN AN ELECTION YEAR,

154
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:20,700
BUT FOR AN ENTIRE PRESIDENTIAL

155
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:21,867
TERM.

156
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:22,800
AND JUST THINK ABOUT HOW LONG

157
00:04:22,867 --> 00:04:24,767
FOUR YEARS IS.

158
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:26,042
FOUR YEARS AGO, HARVEY WEINSTEIN

159
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,567
WAS STILL PRODUCING MOVIES.

160
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:29,400
IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS,

161
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:30,367
HARRY AND MEGHAN BEGAN DATING,

162
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:31,609
GOT ENGAGED, GOT MARRIED, LEFT

163
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:33,867
THE ROYAL FAMILY, AND I THINK

164
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:35,200
OWN NETFLIX NOW?

165
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:36,343
AND IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS,

166
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:37,800
LEONARDO DiCAPRIO'S GIRLFRIEND

167
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:38,910
GAINED THE RIGHT TO LEGALLY

168
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:40,066
DRINK ALCOHOL.

169
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:41,300
TWO MORE YEARS, AND SHE'LL

170
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:42,667
HAVE NO PROBLEM GETTING

171
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:43,633
A RENTAL CAR...

172
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,433
TO MOVE HER BELONGINGS OUT OF

173
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,333
HIS HOUSE.

174
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,266
TIME IS AMAZING.

175
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,200
AND SOME REPUBLICANS SEEM TO

176
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:49,467
RATIONALIZE THEIR PARTY'S

177
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:50,467
BLATANT HYPOCRISY BY SAYING

178
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:51,600
THAT, SHOULD THEY CONFIRM

179
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:52,533
TRUMP'S NOMINEE, THEY'LL SIMPLY

180
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,967
BE BRINGING THE COURT CLOSER TO

181
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:56,233
THE WILL OF THE COUNTRY.

182
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,967
I RECOGNIZE THAT WE MAY HAVE

183
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:00,533
A COURT WHICH HAS MORE OF A

184
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,533
CONSERVATIVE BENT THAN IT'S HAD

185
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,133
OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES, BUT

186
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,533
MY LIBERAL FRIENDS HAVE, OVER

187
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,800
MANY DECADES, GOTTEN VERY USED

188
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:11,433
TO THE IDEA OF HAVING A LIBERAL

189
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,643
COURT, AND THAT'S NOT WRITTEN IN

190
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:13,600
THE STARS.

191
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:14,710
IT'S ALSO APPROPRIATE FOR A

192
00:05:14,734 --> 00:05:16,200
NATION WHICH IS, IF YOU WILL,

193
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:17,567
CENTER RIGHT, TO HAVE A COURT

194
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:18,713
WHICH REFLECTS CENTER RIGHT

195
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,066
POINTS OF VIEW.

196
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:22,233
John: WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU

197
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,700
TALKING ABOUT, MITT?

198
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:24,900
SET ASIDE THE NOTION THAT A

199
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:25,900
COURT THAT GUTTED THE VOTING

200
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:27,533
RIGHTS ACT IS A "LIBERAL COURT,"

201
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,567
SINCE WHEN IS THIS NATION

202
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:32,066
NATURALLY CENTER RIGHT?

203
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:34,066
DID WE ALL TAKE A BUZZFEED QUIZ

204
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,033
THAT I'M NOT REMEMBERING, LIKE

205
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,700
"CHOOSE YOUR FAVORITE

206
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:36,533
FALL LASAGNA INGREDIENTS AND

207
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,433
WE'LL TELL YOU WHICH DIRECTION

208
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,300
THE NATION'S ELECTORATE LEANS?"

209
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:40,567
BECAUSE, FOR THE RECORD, MORE

210
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:41,533
AMERICANS SAY THEY ALIGN WITH

211
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,333
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAN THE

212
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,467
REPUBLICANS.

213
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:46,133
PLUS, POLL AFTER POLL HAS SHOWN

214
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,433
AMERICANS FAVOR ABORTION RIGHTS,

215
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,033
WITH SUPPORT OF ROE V. WADE

216
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,867
REACHING RECORD HIGHS, WHILE A

217
00:05:52,934 --> 00:05:53,834
STRONG MAJORITY OF THE PUBLIC

218
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,300
ALSO SUPPORTS MEDICARE FOR ALL.

219
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:56,667
OH, AND INCIDENTALLY, A SOLID

220
00:05:56,734 --> 00:05:57,743
MAJORITY SAY THE WINNER OF THIS

221
00:05:57,767 --> 00:05:58,843
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SHOULD BE

222
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:00,000
THE ONE TO CHOOSE GINSBURG'S

223
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:01,266
SUCCESSOR.

224
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,500
SO OUR COUNTRY ISN'T SO MUCH

225
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,066
CENTER RIGHT AS MITT ROMNEY IS

226
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:05,867
CENTER WRONG.

227
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:07,567
LOOK, THIS HAS BEEN A VERY DARK

228
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,800
WEEK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE.

229
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:11,027
THE SUPREME COURT IS ABOUT TO

230
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:12,433
LURCH TO THE RIGHT FOR THE

231
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,800
FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

232
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:16,400
AND IF THINGS SEEM HOPELESS

233
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:17,643
RIGHT NOW, IT'S BECAUSE, TO BE

234
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:18,667
COMPLETELY HONEST, THEY

235
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:20,633
BASICALLY ARE.

236
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,667
THIS IS A PIVOTAL MOMENT, AND

237
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:24,867
WHILE WE GOT HERE A LITTLE BIT

238
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:26,600
BY BAD LUCK AND BAD TIMING, WE

239
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:28,333
ALSO GOT HERE THROUGH DILIGENT

240
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,333
EFFORT BY REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP

241
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,567
AND, CRUCIALLY, SOME VERY BIG

242
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:32,800
SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS WHICH JUST

243
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:34,767
HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED.

244
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:36,367
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

245
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:38,900
THAT: SPECIFICALLY, HOW THE FUCK

246
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:40,209
WE GOT HERE AND WHAT THE FUCK WE

247
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,066
CAN POSSIBLY DO NEXT.

248
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:43,033
AND THERE ARE BASICALLY TWO

249
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,142
MAJOR FACTORS THAT BROUGHT US TO

250
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,400
THIS POINT.

251
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:46,567
THE FIRST IS THIS MAN,

252
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:47,934
MITCH McCONNELL, THE ONLY THING

253
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,120
TO COME OUT OF KENTUCKY MORE

254
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,633
SHAMELESS THAN THE KFC MENU.

255
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,867
HOW DO YOU WANT YOUR CHICKEN?

256
00:06:51,934 --> 00:06:52,633
REGULAR?

257
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,300
CRISPY?

258
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:54,400
CHEETO-FLAVORED?

259
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:55,633
IN A WARM SLURRY?

260
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,967
AS BREAD?

261
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:58,200
'CAUSE IT'S ALL ON THE TABLE.

262
00:06:58,266 --> 00:06:59,533
AT KFC, WE PROMISE:

263
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,667
MAXIMUM FLAVOR FOR YOU,

264
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:02,166
MAXIMUM DISRESPECT FOR A

265
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:04,600
CHICKEN'S MEMORY.

266
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:05,676
RECONFIGURING AMERICA'S COURTS

267
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,967
HAS BEEN A SINGLE-MINDED FOCUS

268
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:07,934
FOR McCONNELL.

269
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,600
TRUMP ONCE MARVELED TO

270
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:11,600
BOB WOODWARD THAT "YOU KNOW WHAT

271
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:12,676
MITCH'S BIGGEST THING IS IN THE

272
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,767
WHOLE WORLD?

273
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,000
HIS JUDGES."

274
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:15,900
AND HIS OBSESSION ISN'T JUST

275
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,800
WITH THE SUPREME COURT.

276
00:07:18,867 --> 00:07:19,467
McCONNELL'S BLOCKADE OF

277
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:20,710
MERRICK GARLAND JUSTIFIABLY GOT

278
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:22,066
A LOT OF ATTENTION, BUT HE ALSO

279
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,033
MADE SURE TRUMP COULD STACK THE

280
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,433
LOWER COURTS WITH CONSERVATIVE

281
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,700
JUDGES, SOMETHING TRUMP ALSO

282
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:30,133
EXPLAINED TO WOODWARD.

283
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,400
I'M GOING TO BE UP TO

284
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:32,300
280 JUDGES VERY SOON.

285
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:34,166
NOBODY'S EVER HAD THAT.

286
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:36,166
280.

287
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:37,900
OBAMA GAVE US 142 JUDGES WHEN I

288
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:39,834
CAME HERE.

289
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,900
THIS NEVER HAPPENED.

290
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,133
YOU NEVER HAD ONE.

291
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,700
IF YOU WERE A PRESIDENT, YOU

292
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:45,333
WOULD NEVER HAVE ANY FEDERAL...

293
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:45,934
THEY WERE LIKE GOLDEN NUGGETS,

294
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,834
RIGHT?

295
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,009
John: OKAY, FIRST, IT'S WEIRD

296
00:07:50,033 --> 00:07:50,500
TO REFER TO ANYTHING AS

297
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:51,367
"GOLDEN NUGGETS" UNLESS

298
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:52,900
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ACTUAL

299
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:54,600
GOLDEN NUGGETS OR YOU'RE

300
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:55,533
DESCRIBING YOUR HUSBAND'S BALLS

301
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,500
IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS

302
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:57,607
TIGER-THEMED FUNERAL WHILE

303
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:58,900
IMPERSONATING A PRIEST.

304
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:00,009
THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO PERFECTLY

305
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:02,233
APPROPRIATE TIMES.

306
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,667
BUT NEEDLESS TO SAY, OBAMA VERY

307
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:04,843
MUCH DIDN'T DELIBERATELY LEAVE

308
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:06,500
THOSE VACANCIES OPEN FOR TRUMP.

309
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:08,233
WHEN REPUBLICANS TOOK THE SENATE

310
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,700
IN 2014, MITCH McCONNELL BEGAN

311
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:14,333
SYSTEMATICALLY BLOCKING

312
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,100
LOWER COURT APPOINTEES SO A

313
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:15,900
FUTURE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT

314
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:17,200
COULD FILL THE SEATS LATER.

315
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:18,700
SO OBAMA DIDN'T GIVE TRUMP THOSE

316
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:19,867
JUDGES ANY MORE THAN THE

317
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:20,967
NATIONAL ARCHIVES GAVE

318
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:21,867
NICOLAS CAGE THE DECLARATION OF

319
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,834
INDEPENDENCE.

320
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,233
IN FACT, OBAMA'S ONLY EVER GIVEN

321
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,400
TRUMP TWO THINGS: A BRIEF TOUR

322
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:29,000
OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND A

323
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:30,400
COLOSSAL INFERIORITY COMPLEX

324
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:31,547
THAT FUELED TRUMP'S RISE TO

325
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,880
POWER AND MADE HIM SO FURIOUS HE

326
00:08:32,934 --> 00:08:34,700
DECIDED TO TURN AMERICA INTO AN

327
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:35,800
APOCALYPTIC HELLSCAPE AND

328
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:38,333
DESTROY DEMOCRACY AS WE KNOW IT.

329
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,266
REALLY JUST THOSE TWO THINGS.

330
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,066
AND McCONNELL'S WILLINGNESS TO

331
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:43,667
GO TO THE MAT FOR JUDICIAL

332
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:44,467
APPOINTMENTS WAS PERHAPS NEVER

333
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:45,653
MORE OBVIOUS THAN DURING THE

334
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,500
KAVANAUGH HEARINGS, BECAUSE

335
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,567
IMMEDIATELY AFTER

336
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:48,567
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD'S

337
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:50,667
GUT-WRENCHING TESTIMONY,

338
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:51,533
McCONNELL APPARENTLY HAD THIS

339
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,200
CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT.

340
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:53,967
BOTH OF THEM ARE KIND OF

341
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,033
TESTING EACH OTHER A BIT.

342
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:55,800
"WHERE ARE YOU AT ON THIS?"

343
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:57,567
YOU KNOW, "HOW STRONG ARE YOU?"

344
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:59,133
AND McCONNELL BASICALLY SAYS TO

345
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,376
THE PRESIDENT, "YOU DON'T WORRY

346
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,100
ABOUT ME.

347
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:01,967
I'M STRONG AS MULE PISS."

348
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:02,767
THAT'S HIS QUOTE.

349
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,367
"I'M STRONG AS MULE PISS."

350
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:06,576
IN OTHER WORDS, HE'S NOT GOING

351
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,433
TO LET UP, HE'S NOT GOING TO

352
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,333
GIVE UP, HE'S NOT GOING TO

353
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,500
SURRENDER.

354
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:10,734
John: WOW.

355
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,967
THAT IS EXTRAORDINARY.

356
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:14,500
BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO FORGET THAT

357
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:16,367
AFTER BLASEY FORD'S TESTIMONY,

358
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:17,476
KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION FELT A

359
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,467
LOT LESS CERTAIN.

360
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:20,800
AND TO REACT TO WHAT SHE SAID

361
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:22,934
WITH, "DON'T WORRY, I'M STRONG

362
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,867
AS MULE PISS" IS BOTH HORRENDOUS

363
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:26,934
AND DEEPLY WEIRD.

364
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,433
QUICK SIDE NOTE: I WASN'T SURE

365
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,233
HOW STRONG MULE PISS ACTUALLY

366
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,033
IS, AND THE INTERNET IS

367
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,500
SURPRISINGLY SHORT OF VIDEOS OF

368
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:33,000
MULES URINATING.

369
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:34,533
ALTHOUGH WE DID FIND MANAGE TO

370
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,533
FIND THIS STOCK FOOTAGE TITLED

371
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,867
"DONKEY WHO URINE AT SUNSET,"

372
00:09:37,934 --> 00:09:40,166
AND I HAVE TO SAY, THAT IS AN

373
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:44,767
IMPRESSIVELY STRONG STREAM.

374
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:45,667
SO I DO TOTALLY GET IT NOW.

375
00:09:45,734 --> 00:09:46,300
AND GOING FORWARD, EVERY TIME I

376
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:48,834
THINK OF MITCH McCONNELL, I WILL

377
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,934
THINK OF THAT DONKEY

378
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,967
WHO URINE AT SUNSET.

379
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:53,273
BUT AS EASY AND FUN AS IT IS TO

380
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,000
BLAME MITCH McCONNELL AND HIS

381
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:55,834
MULE PISS FOR EVERYTHING, IT'S A

382
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,934
MISTAKE TO FOCUS JUST ON THE

383
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,633
PEOPLE INVOLVED HERE, BECAUSE

384
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,400
THERE IS A WHOLE SYSTEM

385
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,800
UNDERNEATH THEM THAT HAS ENABLED

386
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:05,333
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE.

387
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,133
AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE SECOND

388
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,000
MAJOR FACTOR THAT GOT US TO

389
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:07,934
WHERE WE ARE NOW: THE DEEPLY

390
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,133
UNDEMOCRATIC NATURE OF

391
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,767
AMERICA'S INSTITUTIONS.

392
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:14,467
BECAUSE THERE IS NO DOUBT, THE

393
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:15,233
REPUBLICAN PARTY CURRENTLY

394
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,734
CONTROLS BOTH THE SENATE AND THE

395
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,700
WHITE HOUSE.

396
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:21,333
IT'S TRUE.

397
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:21,867
AND THEY WILL ARGUE

398
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:22,500
THIS GIVES THEM A MANDATE TO DO

399
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:23,266
EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

400
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,409
CHRIS, THE SENATE MAJORITY IS

401
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:24,967
PERFORMING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL

402
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:25,800
DUTY AND FULFILLING THE MANDATE

403
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:28,600
THAT THE VOTERS GAVE US.

404
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:29,200
VOTERS HAVE ELECTED A

405
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:29,967
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT.

406
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:30,800
THEY ELECTED A REPUBLICAN

407
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:32,033
SENATE.

408
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,867
AND I THINK REPUBLICANS NEED TO

409
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:35,467
KEEP THEIR PROMISES HERE, AND

410
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:36,613
THAT'S WHAT I INTEND TO DO.

411
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:37,200
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ELECTED

412
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:38,767
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND A REPUBLICAN

413
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:39,967
MAJORITY BECAUSE WE WANT THE

414
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:40,900
CONSTITUTION AND BILL OF RIGHTS

415
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:42,767
PROTECTED, AND THAT IS OUR JOB.

416
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:44,333
IT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO.

417
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,266
John: I DO NOT LIKE THAT MAN

418
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,367
TED CRUZ.

419
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:46,967
I DO NOT LIKE

420
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:48,033
HIS BACKWARD VIEWS.

421
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:49,600
I DO NOT LIKE HIS STUPID SUITS.

422
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:51,667
I DO NOT LIKE HIS COWBOY BOOTS.

423
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,433
I DO NOT LIKE HIM WHEN

424
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,433
HE SNEEZES.

425
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,333
I DO NOT LIKE HIM

426
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,667
EATING CHEESES.

427
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:57,100
I HATE TO SEE

428
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:57,967
HIS DUMB FACE SMIRKIN',

429
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,333
BECAUSE HIS BEARD LOOKS LIKE

430
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,166
A MERKIN.

431
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:05,343
BUT, LOOK, LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT

432
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:05,867
MANDATE, BECAUSE NEITHER THE

433
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:06,500
PRESIDENCY NOR THE SENATE ARE AS

434
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:07,609
REFLECTIVE OF THE WILL OF THE

435
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:08,767
AMERICAN PEOPLE AS THEY'RE

436
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,900
SUGGESTING THERE.

437
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:11,500
FIRST, TAKE THE WHITE HOUSE.

438
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:13,200
A DEMOCRAT HAS WON THE NATIONAL

439
00:11:13,266 --> 00:11:15,133
POPULAR VOTE IN FOUR OUT OF THE

440
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,166
LAST FIVE ELECTIONS, BUT WE HAVE

441
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:19,000
SPENT 12 OF THE LAST 20 YEARS

442
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:20,900
WITH A REPUBLICAN IN OFFICE, AND

443
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:22,500
THAT IS BECAUSE THE ELECTORAL

444
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:23,967
COLLEGE, WITH ITS

445
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:25,176
WINNER-TAKE-ALL APPROACH IN MOST

446
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,467
STATES, CAN DISTORT THE WILL OF

447
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:28,500
THE MAJORITY, ON TOP OF WHICH IT

448
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:29,710
GRANTS DISPROPORTIONATE POWER TO

449
00:11:29,734 --> 00:11:31,800
LESS POPULOUS STATES, WHICH TEND

450
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:33,533
TO BE RURAL AND MORE

451
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,810
CONSERVATIVE, SOMETHING WHICH IS

452
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:36,266
EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED IN THE

453
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,333
SENATE, WHERE THERE ARE

454
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,100
15 STATES REPRESENTING

455
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,133
38 MILLION PEOPLE THAT HAVE

456
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,900
30 REPUBLICAN SENATORS, EVEN

457
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:44,667
THOUGH THAT IS LESS THAN THE

458
00:11:44,734 --> 00:11:46,033
TOTAL POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA,

459
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,667
WHICH HAS JUST TWO DEMOCRATIC

460
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:50,033
ONES.

461
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,109
AND THAT'S BEFORE YOU EVEN

462
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:52,300
GET INTO THE FACT THAT

463
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:53,447
PLACES LIKE PUERTO RICO AND

464
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,633
WASHINGTON D.C.... WHERE THE

465
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,710
POPULATIONS ARE LARGELY BLACK

466
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:56,834
OR HISPANIC... DON'T HAVE

467
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,009
REPRESENTATION IN THE SENATE AT

468
00:11:58,033 --> 00:11:59,133
ALL.

469
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,867
IN FACT, IF YOU TAKE ALL THIS

470
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:02,300
TOGETHER, THE SENATE GIVES THE

471
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:03,834
AVERAGE BLACK AMERICAN ONLY 75%

472
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,333
AS MUCH REPRESENTATION AS THE

473
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,600
AVERAGE WHITE AMERICAN AND THE

474
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:08,033
AVERAGE HISPANIC AMERICAN ONLY

475
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,300
55% AS MUCH.

476
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,066
AND IT'S CLEARLY NOT GREAT WHEN

477
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:13,500
THE BEST THING YOU CAN SAY ABOUT

478
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,900
YOUR REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY

479
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:18,800
IS, "HEY, AT LEAST BLACK PEOPLE

480
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:20,400
GOT ABOVE THREE FIFTHS THIS

481
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:21,100
TIME.

482
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,176
AT THIS RATE, THEY COULD COUNT

483
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,834
AS 100% OF A WHITE PERSON AS

484
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,533
EARLY AS 2408.

485
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,367
ONWARDS AND UPWARDS,

486
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:30,533
BLACK PEOPLE!

487
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,166
YOU TRULY ARE AN INSPIRATION TO

488
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:32,533
HISPANIC HALF-PEOPLE

489
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,367
EVERYWHERE."

490
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:34,233
SO THE FACT IS, WHEN BARRETT IS

491
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,540
CONFIRMED, A PRESIDENT WHO LOST

492
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:36,200
THE POPULAR VOTE WILL HAVE

493
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:37,166
PICKED A QUARTER OF THE FEDERAL

494
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:38,353
JUDICIARY AND A THIRD OF THE

495
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,133
SUPREME COURT, AND HIS CHOICES

496
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,667
WILL HAVE BEEN RUBBER-STAMPED BY

497
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:43,467
A SENATE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY

498
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:45,233
REPRESENTING 15 MILLION FEWER

499
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,300
PEOPLE THAN THE DEMOCRATIC

500
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,600
"MINORITY," AND THOSE COURTS

501
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:54,767
HAVE ALLOWED REPUBLICANS TO SET

502
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:56,400
WILDLY UNPOPULAR POLICY THAT

503
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:57,576
WOULDN'T ACTUALLY PASS MUSTER

504
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,300
WITH VOTERS.

505
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:01,800
AND THAT BRINGS US TO OUR FINAL

506
00:13:01,867 --> 00:13:03,100
QUESTION OF, WHAT CAN NOW BE

507
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,166
DONE?

508
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,533
WELL, FOR DEMOCRATS, THE FIRST

509
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,400
PRIORITY IS TO TRY AND TAKE

510
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:08,643
CONTROL OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND

511
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:09,266
BOTH CHAMBERS OF CONGRESS THIS

512
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,433
NOVEMBER, WHICH, GIVEN

513
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,834
EVERYTHING WE'VE JUST DISCUSSED,

514
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,033
IS BY NO MEANS A CERTAINTY.

515
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,500
NOT ONLY COULD TRUMP WIN THE

516
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:17,367
ELECTION OUTRIGHT, EVEN IF HE

517
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:18,443
DOESN'T, HE COULD, AS HE'S

518
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:20,033
REPEATEDLY INDICATED, REFUSE TO

519
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,266
CONCEDE AND FORCE THE RESULT

520
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,400
INTO THE COURTS.

521
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:24,900
AND THAT POSSIBILITY IS CLEARLY

522
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:25,533
PART OF HIS HASTE TO GET A

523
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,000
JUSTICE CONFIRMED BEFORE THE

524
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:30,433
ELECTION.

525
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,100
BECAUSE HE'S NOT EVEN TRYING TO

526
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,166
HIDE IT NOW.

527
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,333
WE NEED NINE JUSTICES.

528
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,367
YOU NEED THAT.

529
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:39,467
WITH THE UNSOLICITED MILLIONS OF

530
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:40,967
BALLOTS THAT THEY'RE SENDING,

531
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:42,033
IT'S A SCAM, IT'S A HOAX,

532
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:45,900
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

533
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:47,367
AND THE DEMOCRATS KNOW IT BETTER

534
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:47,934
THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

535
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,600
SO YOU'RE GONNA NEED NINE

536
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:49,233
JUSTICES UP THERE.

537
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:49,967
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY

538
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:53,066
IMPORTANT.

539
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,567
John: OKAY.

540
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:56,233
THERE IS A NUMBER OF

541
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:56,734
DARK INSINUATIONS THERE,

542
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,533
INCLUDING, "IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

543
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,166
US TO CHOOSE THE NEXT JUSTICE SO

544
00:13:58,233 --> 00:13:59,533
THEY CAN DECIDE WHAT THE

545
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,467
AMERICAN PEOPLE CHOSE."

546
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:02,733
AND THAT MAKES IT PRETTY CLEAR

547
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:03,600
THAT, FOR TRUMP, HAVING AN

548
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:04,967
ADDITIONAL SUPREME COURT

549
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:06,300
APPOINTMENT IS ABSOLUTELY

550
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,266
CRUCIAL TO HIS RE-ELECTION...

551
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,409
AS CRUCIAL, SAY, AS ANGRY WHITE

552
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:10,767
PEOPLE WEARING RED HATS,

553
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:11,700
FACEBOOK POSTS FROM UNDERCOVER

554
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,233
RUSSIAN OPERATIVES, AND, BASED

555
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,834
ON HIS CAMPAIGN'S ONLINE STORE,

556
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,233
SELLING TRUMP COLORING BOOKS

557
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,066
THAT EVEN THE KIDS IN THE AD

558
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:18,533
LOOK BORED BY.

559
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,834
WHAT IS GOING ON THERE?

560
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,200
THE YOUNGER KID ISN'T EVEN

561
00:14:23,266 --> 00:14:24,100
PAYING ATTENTION, AND THE OLDER

562
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:24,934
ONE LOOKS LIKE HE'S TRYING TO

563
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,767
WILL THE COLORING BOOK INTO

564
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:27,433
BECOMING A NINTENDO SWITCH WITH

565
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,767
HIS EYES.

566
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:33,433
ALSO, WHY AREN'T THEY

567
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,133
COLORING IN THE COLORING BOOK?

568
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,033
THE FATHER SEEMS TO BE READING

569
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,767
IT TO HIS CHILDREN, WHICH IS

570
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,009
OBJECTIVELY THE ONE WRONG WAY TO

571
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:41,533
ENJOY A COLORING BOOK.

572
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,667
BUT LOO, LET'S SAY, FOR THE SAKE

573
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:45,014
OF ARGUMENT, DEMOCRATS DO MANAGE

574
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:45,633
TO SWEEP THE UPCOMING ELECTION.

575
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,500
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE WOULD BE TO

576
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:48,133
THINK THAT THAT HAS, IN ITSELF,

577
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,700
FIXED EVERYTHING... OR, INDEED,

578
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:51,500
ANYTHING... BECAUSE THERE'S NO

579
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:52,767
POINT GETTING POWER UNLESS YOU

580
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,000
ARE THEN WILLING TO BE BOLD

581
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:55,200
ENOUGH TO USE IT TO MAKE

582
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:57,633
SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL CHANGE.

583
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,867
WE'VE ARGUED BEFORE THAT THE

584
00:14:58,934 --> 00:15:00,233
FILIBUSTER SHOULD BE ABOLISHED.

585
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,166
THAT WOULD ALLOW LEGISLATION TO

586
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,000
GET PASSED WITH A SIMPLE

587
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:05,266
MAJORITY.

588
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:05,967
IT IS ADMITTEDLY RISKY,

589
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:07,076
ESPECIALLY FOR A PARTY THAT,

590
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,734
AGAIN, FOR STRUCTURAL REASONS,

591
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,976
CAN EXPECT TO BE IN THE MINORITY

592
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,967
MORE OFTEN THAN IT SHOULD.

593
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:12,834
BUT THOSE VERY FACTORS MAKE IT

594
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,140
EXTREMELY HARD FOR DEMOCRATS TO

595
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,133
WIN A FILIBUSTER-PROOF

596
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,266
SUPERMAJORITY AND DO ANYTHING

597
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:21,800
MEANINGFUL.

598
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:22,734
WHAT IS FRUSTRATING IS THAT SOME

599
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,233
CENTRIST DEMOCRATS, LIKE

600
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,309
JOE MANCHIN, HONESTLY SEEM TO

601
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,333
THINK THAT, EVEN IF THEY GET

602
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,734
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE POWER, THE

603
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,000
BEST WAY FORWARD IS TO TRY AND

604
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:31,142
RETURN TO A MORE CIVILIZED,

605
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:31,867
MODERATE ERA IN AMERICAN

606
00:15:31,934 --> 00:15:34,333
POLITICS.

607
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,066
I WILL MAKE EVERY DECISION

608
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:39,033
I CAN THAT KEEPS THE SENATE

609
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,734
BIPARTISAN.

610
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,133
SIMPLE AS THAT.

611
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,133
WE HAVE GOT TO FIGHT FOR

612
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,700
BASICALLY WHO WE ARE AS A

613
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:44,233
SENATE.

614
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,700
CAN WE REPRESENT THE PEOPLE IN A

615
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:46,066
BIPARTISAN WAY?

616
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:47,300
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS.

617
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:48,633
John: OH, I'VE GOT AN ANSWER

618
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,433
TO THAT QUESTION FOR YOU, JOE:

619
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,433
NO.

620
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,667
YOU CAN'T.

621
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:53,066
IT SEEMS THE MESSAGE MANCHIN

622
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:55,066
WOULD TAKE FROM AMERICA SURGING

623
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:56,467
TO THE LEFT, AGAINST THE ODDS,

624
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:57,609
WOULD BE "I THINK THEY WANT US

625
00:15:57,633 --> 00:16:01,900
TO WORK WITH REPUBLICANS."

626
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:03,600
AND THAT IS NOT JUST DUMB,

627
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,066
THAT'S DUMB ON THE LEVEL OF

628
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:06,176
JAMES CAMERON GOING, "YOU KNOW

629
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,600
WHAT PEOPLE WANT?

630
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:07,333
FOUR MORE 'AVATAR' MOVIES."

631
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,333
AND TO BOTH OF THOSE MEN, I SAY

632
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:08,934
THIS: NO ONE WANTS THAT, STOP

633
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,734
TALKING ABOUT IT, AND JUST GIVE

634
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,834
US WHAT WE WANT:

635
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,834
ONE MORE GOOD "TERMINATOR" MOVIE

636
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,934
AND A GREEN NEW DEAL.

637
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,834
I DON'T CARE WHICH OF YOU DOES

638
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,133
WHICH, JUST GET IT THE FUCK

639
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,300
DONE.

640
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:19,800
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, EVEN IF THE

641
00:16:19,867 --> 00:16:21,867
DEMOCRATS SWEEP THE ELECTION,

642
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:23,867
AND EVEN IF THEY THEN GET RID OF

643
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:24,600
THE FILIBUSTER AND THEN HAVE THE

644
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:25,834
COURAGE TO PASS MAJOR

645
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,500
LEGISLATION, THOSE LAWS ARE NOW

646
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:28,800
INCREASINGLY VULNERABLE TO A

647
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:30,009
MORE CONSERVATIVE SUPREME COURT

648
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:32,266
STRIKING THEM DOWN.

649
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,576
AND THAT HAS LED SOME TO SUGGEST

650
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,743
TAKING THE MORE DRAMATIC STEP OF

651
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:36,567
EXPANDING THE SUPREME COURT BY

652
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:38,066
ADDING JUSTICES.

653
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:39,467
IT'S POSSIBLE.

654
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:40,813
THE CONSTITUTION DOESN'T SPECIFY

655
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,333
HOW MANY SEATS THERE SHOULD BE,

656
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,934
AND IT CAN AND HAS BEEN DONE IN

657
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,700
THE PAST THROUGH A SIMPLE ACT OF

658
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:46,900
CONGRESS, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE

659
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:48,233
REAL CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT THE

660
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,000
EVENTUAL BLOWBACK TO THAT WOULD

661
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:54,100
BE.

662
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,446
BECAUES IT DOESN'T TAKE A GENIUS

663
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,734
TO IMAGINE WHAT REPUBLICANS

664
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,066
WOULD DO NEXT TIME THEY TOOK

665
00:16:58,133 --> 00:17:00,734
CONTROL OF THE GOVERNMENT.

666
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,300
SERIOUSLY, IT DOESN'T TAKE A

667
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:01,834
GENIUS.

668
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,467
THEY WANNA PACK THE COURT...

669
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:03,133
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

670
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,033
THEY WANNA PUT ON A LOT OF

671
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,767
JUSTICES.

672
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:05,367
THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE JUST

673
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:06,333
HORRIBLE.

674
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,200
I GUESS WE COULD DO THAT TOO,

675
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:08,033
RIGHT?

676
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,233
WE COULD DO THAT TOO.

677
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:09,900
John: YEAH.

678
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:11,100
HE'S RIGHT.

679
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,276
HE COULD ABSOLUTELY DO THAT,

680
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,934
WHICH IS UNDENIABLY CHILLING.

681
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,153
EXPANDING THE COURT IS A BIT

682
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,667
LIKE DOING YOGA NAKED...

683
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:17,900
ONE WAY TO DAMPEN YOUR

684
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:19,109
ENTHUSIASM FOR THE IDEA IS TO

685
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:20,293
PICTURE DONALD TRUMP DOING IT

686
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,100
TOO.

687
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,533
COURT EXPANSION COULD OPEN THE

688
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,533
DOOR TO A NEVER-ENDING CYCLE OF

689
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,400
BOTH PARTIES DOING IT, WHICH

690
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:28,000
COULD PERMANENTLY DESTABILIZE

691
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:29,400
ONE OF THE BEDROCK INSTITUTIONS

692
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:31,000
OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENT.

693
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:32,076
NOW, DOES THAT OUTWEIGH THE

694
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,734
POTENTIAL FOR A COURT WITH

695
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
BARRETT ON IT UNDOING OR

696
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:35,976
BLOCKING YEARS OF PROTECTIONS

697
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,834
FOR OUR CLIMATE, HEALTH CARE,

698
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,567
AND CIVIL AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS?

699
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:42,100
THAT IS DEFINITELY WORTH

700
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:42,700
CONSIDERING.

701
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:43,567
NOTHING SHOULD BE TAKEN LIGHTLY

702
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:44,643
HERE... THOUGH I WILL SAY, THERE

703
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:45,743
ARE SOME OTHER STEPS WE COULD

704
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:46,633
TAKE THAT SHOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE

705
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,776
TO ARGUE WITH AT THIS POINT,

706
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,667
STEPS THAT WOULD MAKE BOTH THE

707
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,743
SENATE AND WHITE HOUSE MORE

708
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:50,767
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE

709
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,166
ELECTORATE.

710
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:53,300
ON THE SENATE SIDE, YOU

711
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:55,100
COULD GRANT STATEHOOD TO

712
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,567
WASHINGTON D.C. AND, IF VOTERS

713
00:17:56,633 --> 00:17:58,000
THERE WANT IT, PUERTO RICO.

714
00:17:58,066 --> 00:17:59,400
THAT WOULD NOT ONLY HELP BALANCE

715
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:05,600
OUT THE SENATE'S PRO-WHITE,

716
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,367
...BIAS TOWARD WHITE, RURAL

717
00:18:08,433 --> 00:18:08,600
VOTERS,

718
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:09,100
IT'S ALSO THE

719
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:09,700
RIGHT FUCKING THING TO DO FOR

720
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:10,300
THE ALMOST 4 MILLION AMERICANS

721
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:10,934
WHO CURRENTLY HAVE NO SENATORIAL

722
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,266
REPRESENTATION WHATSOEVER, WHICH

723
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:13,800
IS JUST ASTONISHING.

724
00:18:13,867 --> 00:18:14,943
IT'S ROUGHLY THE POPULATION OF

725
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:15,567
RHODE ISLAND, MAINE, MONTANA,

726
00:18:15,633 --> 00:18:18,467
AND WYOMING COMBINED.

727
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:19,900
NOW, AS FOR THE PRESIDENCY, WE

728
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:20,600
HAVE TO GET RID OF THE ELECTORAL

729
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:21,800
COLLEGE, WHICH MIGHT SOUND

730
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:22,533
RADICAL, BUT IT REALLY ISN'T.

731
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,834
IT'S NOT EVEN A NEW IDEA.

732
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,800
IN FACT, IN THE LATE '60s, IT

733
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:28,700
VERY NEARLY HAPPENED.

734
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:29,967
HERE'S BIRCH BAYH, THE SENATOR

735
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:31,109
WHO SPEARHEADED THOSE EFFORTS,

736
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:32,667
MAKING WHAT IS, IN RETROSPECT, A

737
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:35,500
PRETTY CONVINCING CASE:

738
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:37,633
THERE IS A GREAT DANGER WITH

739
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,066
THE PRESENT ELECTORAL COLLEGE

740
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:40,967
SYSTEM OF ELECTING A MINORITY,

741
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:42,500
OR A NON-PLURALITY, PRESIDENT,

742
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:44,066
OF ELECTING A PRESIDENT WHO HAS

743
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:45,066
FEWER VOTES THAN THE FELLA HE'S

744
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:46,266
RUNNING AGAINST.

745
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,133
WHEN WE HAVE AN ELECTORAL

746
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,800
COLLEGE SYSTEM WHICH THREATENS

747
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:51,166
TO ELECT A MAN WHO HAS FEWER

748
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:52,900
VOTES THAN HIS OPPONENT, WE TEND

749
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,400
TO ERODE THE CONFIDENCE IN THE

750
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,867
PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY IN THEIR

751
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,009
PRESIDENT AND IN THEIR FORM OF

752
00:18:57,033 --> 00:18:58,133
GOVERNMENT.

753
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,266
John: RIGHT.

754
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,900
AND AS SOMEONE WHO'S LIVED

755
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:03,433
THROUGH THE EXACT HYPOTHETICAL

756
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,100
HE JUST DESCRIBED, AND TWICE, I

757
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,209
CAN REPORT THAT OUR CONFIDENCE

758
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:07,700
IN GOVERNMENT HASN'T SO MUCH

759
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:08,967
BEEN ERODED... EROSION IS A

760
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:09,934
SLOW, DIGNIFIED PROCESS... AS

761
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,133
MUCH AS IT'S BEEN HIT BY AN

762
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,633
ASTEROID FULL OF SENTIENT

763
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,934
NUCLEAR JACKHAMMERS UNTIL IT

764
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,934
COLLAPSED IN ON ITSELF LIKE A

765
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,166
STAR INSIDE A BLACK HOLE.

766
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:18,367
BACK THEN, THE IDEA OF

767
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:19,543
ABOLISHING THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE

768
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:21,300
HAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.

769
00:19:21,367 --> 00:19:23,033
THEN-PRESIDENT NIXON EVEN URGED

770
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,800
CONGRESS TO GO THROUGH WITH IT,

771
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:26,633
WRITING "EVERY FOUR YEARS, THE

772
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,166
AMERICAN DEMOCRACY PLACES A

773
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,400
LARGE, UNACCEPTABLE, AND

774
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:30,600
UNNECESSARY WAGER THAT THE

775
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:31,934
ELECTORAL COLLEGE WILL WORK ONE

776
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,934
MORE TIME."

777
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,300
WHICH DOES MAKE SENSE, BECAUSE

778
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:36,934
IF THERE'S ONE THING WE KNOW

779
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,133
NIXON WAS NOT A FAN OF, IT'S

780
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,033
LEAVING ELECTIONS UP TO CHANCE.

781
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,209
AND IF THERE ARE SIX THINGS WE

782
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:42,066
KNOW HE WASN'T A FAN OF, IT'S

783
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:43,667
JEWS, BLACKS, HIPPIES, SNITCHES,

784
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:45,166
LIVING VIETNAMESE PEOPLE, AND

785
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:46,400
THEN LEAVING ELECTIONS UP TO

786
00:19:46,467 --> 00:19:48,000
CHANCE.

787
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:52,600
MISS YOU, DICK.

788
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:53,500
BUT OBVIOUSLY, WE DIDN'T END UP

789
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,367
DOING AWAY WITH THE ELECTORAL

790
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:55,133
COLLEGE IN 1970, BECAUSE THE

791
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,033
LEGISLATION WAS ULTIMATELY

792
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,734
BLOCKED BY, YOU GUESSED IT, A

793
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,300
FUCKING FILIBUSTER.

794
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:04,700
AND EVEN TODAY, THE IDEA HAS

795
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:08,867
WIDESPREAD SUPPORT, WITH 61% OF

796
00:20:08,934 --> 00:20:11,066
AMERICANS SAYING WE SHOULD

797
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:12,033
ABOLISH THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE.

798
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,367
BUT REPUBLICANS WILL FIERCELY

799
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:14,100
DEFEND IT.

800
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:14,934
IN FACT, WHEN A MOVEMENT TO

801
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,633
SWITCH TO A NATIONAL POPULAR

802
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,300
VOTE BEGAN PICKING UP STEAM A

803
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:16,934
DECADE AGO, MITCH McCONNELL SAID

804
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,767
REPUBLICANS NEED TO "KILL IT IN

805
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:20,567
THE CRADLE BEFORE IT GROWS UP."

806
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:21,934
BUT THE BEAUTY IS, THE MOVEMENT

807
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,133
McCONNELL WAS TALKING ABOUT

808
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,400
THERE DOESN'T NECESSARILY

809
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:25,507
REQUIRE HIS COOPERATION...

810
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:27,734
OR, INDEED, AN ACT OF CONGRESS

811
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,367
AT ALL... BECAUSE A GROUP OF

812
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:30,509
STATES HAVE QUIETLY SIGNED ONTO

813
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:34,066
AN INTERESTING WORKAROUND.

814
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:35,767
RECENTLY, 15 STATES AND THE

815
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,734
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA JOINED THE

816
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,080
NATIONAL POPULAR VOTE INTERSTATE

817
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:40,967
COMPACT.

818
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:42,700
THEY'RE PLEDGING TO GIVE THEIR

819
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:43,700
ELECTORAL VOTES TO THE CANDIDATE

820
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:44,810
WHO WINS THE NATIONAL POPULAR

821
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:45,943
VOTE RATHER THAN THE PERSON WHO

822
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:49,000
WINS THE POPULAR VOTE IN THEIR

823
00:20:49,066 --> 00:20:49,333
STATE.

824
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,033
BUT THIS WON'T TAKE EFFECT UNTIL

825
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,380
ENOUGH STATES ADOPT IT WHICH, SO

826
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:54,467
FAR, HASN'T HAPPENED.

827
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:55,533
John: YEAH, IT'S KIND OF

828
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,200
AMAZING.

829
00:20:57,266 --> 00:20:58,900
VERY BASICALLY, IF ENOUGH STATES

830
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,600
JUST PRETEND THE ELECTORAL

831
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:01,776
COLLEGE DOESN'T EXIST, IT COULD

832
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,100
FUNCTIONALLY DISAPPEAR.

833
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,467
IT'S THE SAME APPROACH EVERY

834
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:05,643
"HARRY POTTER" FAN IS CURRENTLY

835
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:06,500
TRYING TO TAKE TOWARD

836
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:09,967
J.K. ROWLING.

837
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:12,000
OBLIVIATE.

838
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:13,233
YOU GO, THE BOOKS STAY.

839
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,066
NOW, FOR THIS IDEA TO TAKE

840
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:14,900
EFFECT... SETTING ASIDE THE

841
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:16,042
LEGAL HURDLES IT WOULD ALMOST

842
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,000
CERTAINLY FACE... IT WOULD

843
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:18,433
NEED STATES REPRESENTING

844
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,100
270 ELECTORAL VOTES TO SIGN ON.

845
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,376
IT CURRENTLY HAS 196, WHICH IS A

846
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,800
LOT, BUT NEEDS 74 MORE, WHICH

847
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,834
WOULD BE INCREASINGLY HARD TO

848
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,734
GET.

849
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,166
AND OBVIOUSLY, THE BETTER WAY TO

850
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:31,967
ABOLISH THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE

851
00:21:32,033 --> 00:21:33,076
WOULD BE TO DO IT THROUGH A

852
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,800
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, BUT

853
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:37,467
THAT IS EVEN HARDER.

854
00:21:37,533 --> 00:21:38,533
AND I WILL SAY,

855
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:39,333
THERE ARE OTHER IDEAS FOR

856
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,567
SIGNIFICANT REFORM, SUCH AS

857
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,934
SETTING TERM LIMITS FOR

858
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,200
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, WHICH

859
00:21:44,266 --> 00:21:44,800
WE'VE ARGUED BEFORE WE SHOULD

860
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:47,233
ABSOLUTELY DO.

861
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,767
THE POINT HERE IS, IT'S PAST

862
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:49,667
TIME FOR BIG CHANGE.

863
00:21:49,734 --> 00:21:50,567
AND PERHAPS THAT'S WHY

864
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:51,843
REPUBLICANS LIKE KEVIN McCARTHY

865
00:21:51,867 --> 00:21:54,967
ALREADY SEEM TO BE FREAKING OUT.

866
00:21:55,033 --> 00:21:56,667
THE DEMOCRATS BELIEVE IT HAS

867
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:57,633
TO BE THEIR WAY OR NO WAY, BUT

868
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,567
NOW IT'S A NEW EXTREME.

869
00:21:59,633 --> 00:22:00,500
THEY WANT TO EXPAND THE

870
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:01,333
COURT.

871
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,233
THEY WANT TO BRING NEW STATES

872
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,500
INTO THE UNION.

873
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:04,934
ANYTHING THAT RIGS THE SYSTEM ON

874
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,400
THEIR BEHALF INSTEAD OF

875
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:09,066
BELIEVING IN THE RULE OF LAW.

876
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:10,734
John: OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,

877
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,166
FUCK YOU, KEVIN.

878
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:15,867
IF THERE IS ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE

879
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:16,500
WHO DON'T GET TO COMPLAIN ABOUT

880
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:17,266
THEIR OPPONENTS GOING TO

881
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,509
EXTREMES TO GET WHAT THEY WANT,

882
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:19,467
ITS CONGRESSIONAL FUCKING

883
00:22:19,533 --> 00:22:20,900
REPUBLICANS, AND SECONDLY, WE'VE

884
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:22,367
EXPANDED THE COURT BEFORE AND

885
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:24,300
WE'VE ADDED STATES BEFORE.

886
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:26,734
WE ADDED TWO STATES IN 1959.

887
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,967
WE DIDN'T FIGHT WORLD WAR II

888
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:29,967
WITH 50 STARS ON THE FLAG.

889
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:31,867
AMERICA IS CONSTANTLY SHIFTING,

890
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,667
AND GRANTING D.C. AND

891
00:22:33,734 --> 00:22:35,066
PUERTO RICO STATEHOOD OR ENDING

892
00:22:35,133 --> 00:22:36,600
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE WOULD

893
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:38,200
ACTUALLY MAKE OUR SYSTEM MORE

894
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:40,133
DEMOCRATIC RATHER THAN LESS,

895
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,800
BECAUSE THE UNAVOIDABLE TRUTH

896
00:22:41,867 --> 00:22:42,967
HERE IS THAT THE SYSTEM IS

897
00:22:43,033 --> 00:22:45,100
ALREADY RIGGED.

898
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,367
AND IT'S RIGGED IN A WAY THAT

899
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:48,266
HAS ALLOWED A PARTY WITHOUT

900
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,376
POPULAR SUPPORT TO DRASTICALLY

901
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,480
RESHAPE AN ENTIRE BRANCH OF

902
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:51,576
GOVERNMENT FOR THE FORESEEABLE

903
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,567
FUTURE BY APPEALING ALMOST

904
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:55,776
EXCLUSIVELY TO WHITE VOTERS IN

905
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,840
SOME OF THE LEAST POPULOUS

906
00:22:56,867 --> 00:23:01,133
REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY.

907
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,133
THAT'S NOT A MANDATE, AND IT'S

908
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,700
NOT DEMOCRACY.

909
00:23:03,767 --> 00:23:05,266
IT'S A FUCKING TRAVESTY.

910
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:06,543
WE ARE AT END OF A GENERATIONAL

911
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:07,400
BATTLE, AND THE HEARTBREAKING

912
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:09,133
THING IS, WE LOST.

913
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
AND THAT HURTS.

914
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,276
IT'S GOING TO HURT FOR A LONG

915
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,376
TIME FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IN WAYS

916
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,834
THAT COULD TAKE A WHILE TO FULLY

917
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,467
COMPREHEND.

918
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:18,834
BUT THE NEXT BATTLE HAS TO START

919
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,233
RIGHT NOW.

920
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:21,900
AND IT WILL BE LONG.

921
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:22,700
WE DIDN'T GET HERE OVERNIGHT,

922
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:23,600
AND WE WON'T GET OUT OF HERE

923
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:24,900
OVERNIGHT, BUT WE MUST BE

924
00:23:24,967 --> 00:23:26,433
WILLING TO FIGHT TIRELESSLY AND

925
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,734
WITH EVERY TOOL AND TACTIC AT

926
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,133
OUR DISPOSAL, BECAUSE SOMETIMES,

927
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,567
FIGHTING FIRE WITH FIRE ISN'T

928
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:32,500
ENOUGH.

929
00:23:32,567 --> 00:23:33,867
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT MULE PISS WITH

930
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:35,934
MULE PISS.

931
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,133
AND NOW THIS.

932
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,433
Announcer: AND NOW, AN

933
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,000
UNEXPECTED UPDATE REGARDING

934
00:23:45,066 --> 00:23:45,200
PEEPS.

935
00:23:45,266 --> 00:23:48,567
A MAJOR CHANGE FOR ONE CANDY

936
00:23:48,633 --> 00:23:49,467
COMPANY, JUST BONE QUALITY

937
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:51,000
CONFECTIONS HAS ANNOUNCED IT

938
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:52,967
WON'T BE PRODUCING ITS POPULAR

939
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:54,834
PEEPS FOR HALLOWEEN, CHRISTMAS,

940
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,800
OR VALENTINE'S DAY.

941
00:23:56,867 --> 00:23:57,166
VALENTINE'S DAY.

942
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:57,967
VICTORY!

943
00:23:58,033 --> 00:24:02,633
THE PEEPS HAS BEEN PURGED FROM A

944
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,200
HOLIDAY-THEMED GIFT BASKETS.

945
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:05,667
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY MADE THEM

946
00:24:05,734 --> 00:24:09,400
FOR HALLOWEEN OR CHRISTMAS.

947
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:13,333
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE

948
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,033
HALLOWEEN PEEPS EITHER, BUT YOU

949
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:16,633
NEVER STOP LEARNING.

950
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,667
PEEPS WILL NOT BE IN

951
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:20,800
HALLOWEEN CANDY BASKETS THIS

952
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:21,567
YEAR, THE COMPANY THAT PRODUCES

953
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:23,266
THEM SAID THEY WILL BE IN STARS

954
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,000
FOR CHRISTMAS EITHER.

955
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:25,200
DARN.

956
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:27,400
NO, NOT DON, WHATEVER THE

957
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:31,467
OPPOSITE OF "DARN" IS.

958
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:33,066
EVERY FOUR OR FIVE YEARS I

959
00:24:33,133 --> 00:24:35,000
CONVINCE MYSELF TO TRY TO PEEP

960
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:36,633
BECAUSE I LOVE MARSHMALLOWS, AND

961
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,633
EVERY TIME I'M MAD.

962
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,667
I DON'T EVEN TRY THEM

963
00:24:40,734 --> 00:24:40,900
ANYMORE.

964
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:45,633
DON'T EVEN TRY THEM!

965
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,033
THE END OF PEEPS SHALL BE THE

966
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,900
ONE TO DEVOUR YOU.

967
00:24:47,967 --> 00:24:49,967
PRODUCTION STOPPED IN SPRING

968
00:24:50,033 --> 00:24:51,400
WITH LIMITED PRODUCTION RESUMING

969
00:24:51,467 --> 00:24:53,133
IN MID-MAY, HOWEVER, THE CANDY

970
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,867
IS SET TO RESUME NEXT YEAR JUST

971
00:24:55,934 --> 00:24:58,133
IN TIME FOR EASTER.

972
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,400
NO!

973
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:06,133
NO, NO, NO, FUCK, NO!

974
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,734
NO!

975
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,600
John: MOVING ON.

976
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:08,400
FINALLY TONIGHT, A QUICK WORD ON

977
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:08,967
THE CENSUS.

978
00:25:09,033 --> 00:25:10,266
YOU MAY REMEMBER WE COVERED IT

979
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:11,700
LAST YEAR WHEN WE LEARNED

980
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:12,500
DONALD TRUMP THOUGHT IT WAS WHEN

981
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:13,100
YOU COUNT HOW MANY TOILETS ARE

982
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:16,333
IN PEOPLE'S HOUSES.

983
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,600
WHICH, Y'KNOW...

984
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:18,033
IT ISN'T.

985
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,767
THE CENSUS IS HOW THE GOVERNMENT

986
00:25:18,834 --> 00:25:19,300
DETERMINES THINGS LIKE THE

987
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:20,233
NUMBER OF SEATS EACH STATE HAS

988
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:20,934
IN THE HOUSE AND THE

989
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,867
DISTRIBUTION OF FEDERAL FUNDS,

990
00:25:27,934 --> 00:25:31,367
AND GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT WE

991
00:25:31,433 --> 00:25:32,676
JUST TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IN THE

992
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,000
SHOW ABOUT UNDERREPRESENTATION,

993
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:34,700
IT COULDN'T BE MORE IMPORTANT

994
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:35,400
FOR PEOPLE TO FILL IT IN.

995
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:35,900
UNFORTUNATELY, WITH THE

996
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:36,567
PANDEMIC, IT'S BECOME A BIT OF A

997
00:25:36,633 --> 00:25:37,166
CLUSTERFUCK, WITH THE LATEST

998
00:25:37,233 --> 00:25:37,734
NEWS COMING JUST THIS WEEK:

999
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,200
ALL RIGHT, BREAKING

1000
00:25:38,266 --> 00:25:38,734
OVERNIGHT: A FEDERAL COURT

1001
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,467
ORDERING THE TRUMP

1002
00:25:39,533 --> 00:25:40,773
ADMINISTRATION TO DROP PLANS TO

1003
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,233
RUSH THE CENSUS TO A CONCLUSION

1004
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,343
AND EXTENDING COUNTING IN THE

1005
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:45,133
CENSUS FOR AN ADDITIONAL MONTH.

1006
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,633
NOW, THE CENSUS RESULTS

1007
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,266
DETERMINE FUTURE CONGRESSIONAL

1008
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:49,200
DISTRICTING AND HOW FEDERAL

1009
00:25:49,266 --> 00:25:50,600
FUNDING IS DIVVIED UP ACROSS THE

1010
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:52,333
COUNTRY.

1011
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,133
COMMERCE SECRETARY WILBUR ROSS

1012
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,276
HAD ORDERED THE CENSUS BUREAU TO

1013
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,834
FINISH COUNTING BY SEPTEMBER

1014
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,943
30TH, ONE MONTH EARLIER THAN

1015
00:25:57,967 --> 00:25:59,633
ORIGINALLY PLANNED.

1016
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,133
THE RULING IS EXPECTED TO BE

1017
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,700
APPEALED.

1018
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,800
John: YEAH.

1019
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:05,500
THE DEADLINE FOR THE CENSUS WAS

1020
00:26:05,567 --> 00:26:06,967
INITIALLY JULY 31, THEN IT WAS

1021
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:09,000
PUSHED BACK TO OCTOBER 31, THEN

1022
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:10,734
POINTLESSLY MOVED FORWARD TO

1023
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,033
SEPTEMBER 30, WHICH IS IN JUST

1024
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,433
THREE DAYS, AND NOW THE COURTS

1025
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,633
WILL DECIDE WHETHER THAT'S

1026
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,500
ACTUALLY THE DEADLINE OR NOT.

1027
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:17,500
BUT REGARDLESS OF WHEN THE

1028
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:19,667
DEADLINE IS, IT'S SOON.

1029
00:26:19,734 --> 00:26:22,233
AND CURRENTLY, ESTIMATES ARE

1030
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,667
THAT AROUND 14 MILLION

1031
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:24,533
HOUSEHOLDS HAVEN'T PARTICIPATED.

1032
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,633
BASICALLY, THE CENSUS IS

1033
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,743
SOMETHING EVERYONE SHOULD DO,

1034
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:28,266
BUT SOME OF US AREN'T, PUTTING

1035
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:29,433
IT IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS

1036
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,233
FLOSSING, EXCEPT INSTEAD OF

1037
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,433
GETTING GINGIVITIS, YOU'RE

1038
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,133
GETTING UNDERREPRESENTED IN

1039
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,633
CONGRESS.

1040
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,710
AND IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE

1041
00:26:34,734 --> 00:26:36,200
PEOPLE WHO HASN'T FILLED IT OUT

1042
00:26:36,266 --> 00:26:37,200
YET, I CANNOT OVERSTATE HOW

1043
00:26:37,266 --> 00:26:39,500
IMPORTANT IT IS THAT YOU DO SO.

1044
00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:42,400
AND IT'S SO EASY.

1045
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:43,700
JUST GO TO THIS WEBSITE, OR IF

1046
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:45,200
YOU LOVE PHONE CALLS FOR SOME

1047
00:26:45,266 --> 00:26:46,300
REASON, DIAL THIS NUMBER.

1048
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:47,834
THE CENSUS BUREAU SAYS YOU'LL BE

1049
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,867
DONE IN LESS THAN 10 MINUTES,

1050
00:26:50,934 --> 00:26:51,500
BUT HONESTLY, AND NOT TO BRAG, I

1051
00:26:51,567 --> 00:26:52,967
FOUND IT TOOK ME LESS THAN TWO.

1052
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:54,113
SO WHY NOT DO IT RIGHT NOW?

1053
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:55,406
BECAUSE YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TWO

1054
00:26:55,467 --> 00:26:58,433
MINUTES.

1055
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,867
AND THE REASON I KNOW THAT IS,

1056
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:01,042
WE'RE CURRENTLY 28 MINUTES INTO

1057
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:02,306
A 30-MINUTE SHOW, AND I'M ABOUT

1058
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,100
TO DRIVE YOU AWAY TO GO FILL IT

1059
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,500
IN.

1060
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:06,743
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "I DON'T

1061
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:07,667
KNOW ABOUT THAT, I'M PRETTY

1062
00:27:07,734 --> 00:27:08,967
COMFORTABLE RIGHT NOW"...

1063
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:10,133
NOT FOR LONG, YOU'RE NOT.

1064
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,700
BECAUSE FOR THE REST OF THIS

1065
00:27:11,767 --> 00:27:13,233
SHOW, I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU

1066
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,700

00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:16,333
DVD LOGO BOUNCING AROUND, LIKE A

1068
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,567
SUBSTITUTE TEACHER WHO FELL

1069
00:27:17,633 --> 00:27:19,900
ASLEEP AFTER "GLORY" ENDED.

1070
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:21,600
AND NOT ONLY THAT, UNDERNEATH

1071
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:22,743
IT, WE'RE GOING TO BE PLAYING

1072
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:24,233
THE AUDIOBOOK VERSION OF

1073
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,133
SEAN PENN'S "BOB HONEY WHO JUST

00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,934
DO STUFF," READ BY ITS AUTHOR, A

1075
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,800
MAN WITH A FACE THAT'S SEEN

00:27:28,867 --> 00:27:29,667
BETTER DAYS AND A VOICE THAT'S

1077
00:27:29,734 --> 00:27:31,333
SEEN BETTER CENTURIES.

1078
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,100
THE BOOK HAS NO FORMAL PLOT, A

1079
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:34,276
PRESIDENT CHARACTER REFERRED TO

1080
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,600
ONLY AS "MR. LANDLORD," AND IT

1081
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:36,600
CONTAINS LINES LIKE

1082
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:38,133
"EFFERVESCENCE LIVED IN HER

1083
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,567
EVERY CELLULAR EXPRESSION, AND

1084
00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:44,066
SHE HAD SPIZZERINCTUM TO SPARE."

1085
00:27:44,133 --> 00:27:46,133
IT IS DREADFUL.

1086
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,400
SO PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF AND GO

1087
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:49,033

1095
00:27:58,266 --> 00:28:01,300
SCREEN.

1096
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:02,867
LIKE THE WIND.

1097
00:28:02,934 --> 00:28:03,800

00:28:03,867 --> 00:28:04,467
FOR WATCHING, SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

1099
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:08,633
TAKE IT AWAY, BOB.

1100
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,700
THE AMERICA BOB DROVE FROM

1101
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:11,700
WOOD BUTTE TO NEW ORLEANS WAS

1102
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:13,500
NOT THAT ONE OF THE WAR, NOT THE

1103
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:17,433
ONE HE HAD KNOWN IN HIS EARLIEST

1104
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,333
CROSS CONTINENTAL AUTOMOTIVE

1105
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,667
EXCURSIONS, NOT THE ONE OF PAY

1106
00:28:20,734 --> 00:28:23,133
LATER GAS STATIONS, VINTAGE

1107
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,667
DINERS, AND 2-LANE ROADS.

1108
00:28:25,734 --> 00:28:27,066
ONLY THE TRAINS REMAINED IN

1109
00:28:27,133 --> 00:28:28,000
TRIBUTE TO THAT SPIRIT REFUGE IN

1110
00:28:28,066 --> 00:28:30,700
A VANQUISHED BY MODERNITY'S

1111
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:32,266
GRAVE AND THERE WERE A FEW...

1112
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:35,300
