1
00:00:25,767 --> 00:00:26,834
John: HI THERE!

2
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,367
WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

3
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:29,713
TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK VOID,

4
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:30,266
WHICH MAKES ME LOOK LIKE I'M

5
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,033
IN ONE OF THOSE OLD E-HARMONY

6
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,140
COMMERCIALS, BUT FEATURING

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,934
THE CUSTOMERS WHO DIDN'T

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,734
FIND LOVE.

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,166
AND IT'S BEEN A VERY BUSY WEEK,

10
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:37,767
DOMINATED BY THE PRESIDENTIAL

11
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:39,100
CAMPAIGN.

12
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,567
TRUMP HELD MULTIPLE RALLIES

13
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:42,400
THIS WEEK, INCLUDING ONE IN

14
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:43,587
ERIE, PENNSYLVANIA, WHERE HE

15
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:44,567
GAVE A SURPRISINGLY HONEST

16
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:46,066
SPEECH.

17
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:47,066
BEFORE THE PLAGUE CAME IN,

18
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:48,867
I HAD IT MADE.

19
00:00:48,934 --> 00:00:50,567
I WASN'T COMING TO ERIE.

20
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,100
I MEAN, I HAVE TO BE HONEST,

21
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,500
THERE'S NO WAY I WAS COMING.

22
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:54,633
I DIDN'T HAVE TO.

23
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,000
I WOULD HAVE CALLED YOU AND

24
00:00:56,066 --> 00:00:56,834
SAID, "HEY ERIE, YOU KNOW, IF

25
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,433
YOU HAVE A CHANCE, GET OUT AND

26
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:57,633
VOTE."

27
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,800
WE HAD THIS THING WON.

28
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:00,900
John: WOW.

29
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:01,567
BOLD MOVE THERE TO NEG

30
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:03,467
A SWING STATE.

31
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:05,767
BUT I GUESS WE ALL HAD GRAND

32
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:06,533
DESIGNS FOR THIS YEAR "BEFORE

33
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,734
THE PLAGUE CAME IN."

34
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:08,967
TRUMP WAS GOING TO CONTINUE

35
00:01:09,033 --> 00:01:10,142
IGNORING ERIE LIKE A PHONE CALL

36
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,433
FROM ONE OF HIS CHILDREN.

37
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,509
LOTS OF PEOPLE WERE GOING TO

38
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:13,133
SPEND HOLIDAYS WITH THEIR

39
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,533
STILL-ALIVE GRANDPARENTS.

40
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,867
AND I WAS GOING TO CONTINUE MY

41
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:17,133
43-YEAR STREAK OF NEVER ONCE

42
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,633
SETTING FOOT IN DANBURY,

43
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,967
CONNECTICUT.

44
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:20,242
IT SEEMS TIME MAKES FOOLS OF ALL

45
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:21,967
OF US.

46
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:23,200
BUT YOU CAN SEE WHY

47
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:23,967
THE PRESIDENT MIGHT BE FEELING

48
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:25,600
NERVOUS.

49
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:27,467
THIS MONTH HAS BROUGHT ENOUGH

50
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:28,734
OCTOBER SURPRISES FOR HIM TO

51
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,333
RENDER THAT TERM COMPLETELY

52
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,166
MEANINGLESS... FROM CONTRACTING

53
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:33,600
COVID, TO THE MULTIPLE DAMNING

54
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:35,033
STORIES ABOUT HIS TAX RECORDS,

55
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,000
INCLUDING THE REVELATION HE HAS

56
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:38,533
A PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN BANK

57
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,333
ACCOUNT IN CHINA.

58
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,700
AND YET, FOR TRUMP SUPPORTERS,

59
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:43,200
IT SEEMS ALL OF THAT IS

60
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:45,166
COMPLETELY OFFSET BY THIS.

61
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:46,667
THE FBI DOES, IN FACT,

62
00:01:46,734 --> 00:01:48,367
HAVE POSSESSION OF

63
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:53,467
HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP.

64
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:54,300
EMAILS ALLEGEDLY FROM

65
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:54,767
HUNTER BIDEN'S

66
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:55,600
LAPTOP.

67
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:56,467
HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP.

68
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,200
HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP.

69
00:01:57,266 --> 00:01:57,934
HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP.

70
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,667
LAPTOP.

71
00:01:58,734 --> 00:01:59,233
LAPTOP.

72
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,100
LAPTOP.

73
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:00,967
AND THEY FOUND THE LAPTOP.

74
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:01,600
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL THAT?

75
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:02,934
THE LAPTOP FROM HELL.

76
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,042
John: YES, THE LAPTOP FROM

77
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:05,467
HELL.

78
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:06,567
NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH

79
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:07,900
THE LAPTOP IN HELL,

80
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:08,800
WHICH I BELIEVE IS OWNED BY

81
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:10,667
JEFFREY TOOBIN.

82
00:02:10,734 --> 00:02:14,200
I'M SO SORRY FOR EVERYTHING

83
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:15,867
THAT YOU'VE SEEN.

84
00:02:15,934 --> 00:02:17,333
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

85
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,767
WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE TALKING

86
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:19,533
ABOUT THERE, IT REVOLVES AROUND

87
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,633
EMAILS AND TEXT MESSAGES

88
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,600
SUPPOSEDLY RECOVERED FROM

89
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:22,500
A LAPTOP BELONGING TO

90
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:23,467
HUNTER BIDEN.

91
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:25,433
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF RED FLAGS

92
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,066
HERE... INCLUDING THE FACT

93
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:29,166
THE "NEW YORK POST" STORY THAT

94
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:29,800
BROKE IT WAS REPORTEDLY "WRITTEN

95
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:30,633
MOSTLY BY A STAFF REPORTER WHO

96
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,033
REFUSED TO PUT HIS NAME ON IT."

97
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,333
AND THE LAPTOP'S CONDUIT TO

98
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,543
THE PRESS IS RUDY GIULIANI, WHO

99
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:37,467
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS FLAGGED

100
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:38,900
LAST YEAR AS THE TARGET OF A

101
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:40,042
RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE OPERATION

102
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:42,600
TO FEED MISINFORMATION TO TRUMP.

103
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,066
AND GIULIANI'S ABILITY TO SPOT

104
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:45,200
FRAUDULENT INFORMATION IS,

105
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:47,433
AT BEST, NOT GREAT.

106
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,367
HE'S SO TECHNOLOGICALLY

107
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:50,333
ILLITERATE, HE HAS BUTT-DIALED

108
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,500
A REPORTER AND LEFT AN

109
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:52,567
ACCIDENTAL VOICE MAIL,

110
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,834
MORE THAN ONCE.

111
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,767
HE RECENTLY ACCIDENTALLY

112
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:56,066
UPLOADED A VIDEO OF HIMSELF

113
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:57,300
AFFECTING A STEREOTYPICAL

114
00:02:57,367 --> 00:03:00,033
CHINESE ACCENT, AND JUST THIS

115
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,276
WEEK, IT EMERGED HE HAS A CAMEO

116
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,300
IN THE NEW BORAT FILM.

117
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:04,133
SCREENSHOTS FROM THE MOVIE

118
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,367
WERE PUBLISHED BY VARIETY

119
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:05,934
IN BRITAIN'S "THE GUARDIAN"

120
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,400
NEWSPAPER.

121
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:09,433
RUDY GIULIANI IS SEEN HELPING

122
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,533
THE WOMAN TAKE HER MICROPHONE

123
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,200
OFF AND THEN THERE IS A SCENE

124
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:14,433
WHERE IT APPEARS THAT

125
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,900
RUDY GIULIANI'S HAND GOES DOWN

126
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:18,033
HIS PANT.

127
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,600
John: YOU KNOW, IT SAYS

128
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,500
SOMETHING ABOUT RUDY'S CHARACTER

129
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:22,700
THAT THE WEIRDEST PART OF

130
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:24,066
THE SENTENCE "RUDY GIULIANI GOT

131
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:25,276
TRICKED, THEN SHOVED HIS HAND

132
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,667
DOWN HIS PANTS IN A HOTEL ROOM

133
00:03:26,734 --> 00:03:28,467
IN FRONT OF A RELATIVE STRANGER"

134
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:29,066
IS THAT IT DOESN'T END

135
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:30,433
AT THE WORD "RELATIVE."

136
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,834
BUT THE POINT IS, ANY

137
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,433
INFORMATION THAT GIULIANI'S

138
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:34,567
NO

139
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:35,934
PASSING ON SHOULD BE TREATED

140
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,100
WITH EXTREME CAUTION.

141
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,233
AND ALL OF THIS FUNCTIONED

142
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,476
AS A LEAD UP TO THURSDAY'S FINAL

143
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,934
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE.

144
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,367
SOMETHING EVERYONE WAS DREADING,

145
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:43,667
AFTER THE FIASCO OF THE FIRST

146
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:47,533
ONE JUST THREE WEEKS AGO.

147
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,266
AND PERHAPS THAT IS WHY THE

148
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,166
INITIAL REACTION TO THIS WEEK'S

149
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:50,513
DEBATE WAS ONE OF SLIGHT RELIEF.

150
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:53,033
THIS WAS AN ACTUAL DEBATE,

151
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,967
I MEAN, AS OPPOSED TO SOME OF

152
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,033
THE OTHER THINGS WE HAVE HAD.

153
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:56,300
THERE WAS A REAL EXCHANGE.

154
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,233
A SPIRITED BUT CIVIL DEBATE

155
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,000
LAST NIGHT.

156
00:03:58,066 --> 00:03:59,166
FINALLY, A DEBATE.

157
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:01,300
IT WAS SUBSTANTIVE AND

158
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:02,033
INFORMATIVE.

159
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,300
NO ONE SET THEMSELVES

160
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:04,367
ON FIRE IN THE LAST

161
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,667
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE.

162
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:08,867
John: YEAH, TRUE.

163
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:09,943
ALTHOUGH HISTORICALLY, THE BAR

164
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:11,142
FOR SUCCEEDING AT THESE EVENTS

165
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:11,967
HAS BEEN A LITTLE HIGHER THAN

166
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:12,934
"NOBODY BURNS ALIVE."

167
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,700
THIS IS A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE,

168
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:16,333
NOT A BEGINNER'S FIRE JUGGLING

169
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,967
CLASS AT THE COMMUNITY CENTER.

170
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:20,233
AND FOR ANY OTHER CANDIDATE,

171
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,133
THINGS TRUMP SAID ON THAT DEBATE

172
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,266
NO

173
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,533
STAGE WOULD'VE BEEN AN ACT OF

174
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,834
SELF-IMMOLATION.

175
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,066
HE INSISTED WE'RE ROUNDING

176
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:28,200
NO

177
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:30,300
THE TURN ON THE CORONAVIRUS,

178
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:31,100
WHICH WE VERY MUCH ARE NOT.

179
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,066
HE CLAIMED THAT WIND TURBINES

180
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:33,500
"KILL ALL THE BIRDS,"

181
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:34,300
WHICH THEY DON'T.

182
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:35,834
AND ARGUED THAT BIDEN'S CLIMATE

183
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,700
POLICY SUGGESTS, "IF BUILDINGS

184
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:37,266
HAD NO WINDOWS, IT WOULD BE

185
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,166
A LOVELY THING," WHICH IS JUST

186
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:41,066
A VERY WEIRD THING TO SAY.

187
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:41,934
AND THEN THERE WAS THIS.

188
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,700
I AM THE LEAST RACIST PERSON

189
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:48,100
...I CAN'T EVEN SEE THE AUDIENCE

190
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:48,233
NO

191
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:48,834
BECAUSE IT'S SO DARK... BUT I

192
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,433
DON'T CARE WHO'S IN THE AUDIENCE

193
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,367
...I'M THE LEAST RACIST PERSON

194
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:55,300
IN THIS ROOM.

195
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:56,266
John: RIGHT.

196
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:56,867
THAT IS STRANGE FOR

197
00:04:56,934 --> 00:04:57,667
MULTIPLE REASONS.

198
00:04:57,734 --> 00:04:58,974
FIRST, HE'S IMPLYING HIS ANSWER

199
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,667
MIGHT HAVE CHANGED IF THE HOUSE

200
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:00,367
LIGHTS WERE UP.

201
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,576
"I CAN'T EVEN SEE THE AUDIENCE,

202
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,033
BUT I'M THE LEAST RACIST PERSON

203
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,734
IN THE... OH, HOLD ON, IS THAT

204
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,200
TOM HANKS?

205
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,000
OH, SHIT, HE'S DEFINITELY LESS

206
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:09,533
RACIST THAN ME, FOR SURE.

207
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,166
BUT I THINK I'M STILL IN

208
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:11,000
THE TOP TWO."

209
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:12,186
ALSO, IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT

210
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:13,276
WHEN HE SAID HE'S THE LEAST

211
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:13,900
RACIST PERSON IN THE ROOM, THAT

212
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:14,700
ROOM CONTAINED... AND THIS IS

213
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:18,533
TRUE... HIS FAMILY.

214
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,934
SO HE'S EFFECTIVELY THROWING

215
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,400
THEM UNDER THE BUS THERE, TOO.

216
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:24,576
LOOK, WHAT IS REALLY SAD HERE IS

217
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,266
THAT WHEN PEOPLE CLAIM TRUMP WAS

218
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,166
ON HIS "BEST BEHAVIOR"... THAT'S

219
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:27,133
ACTUALLY TRUE.

220
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,209
BUT HIS BEST BEHAVIOR IS STILL

221
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:29,934
ABSOLUTELY APPALLING.

222
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,767
BECAUSE EVEN WHEN THE BAR IS

223
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:33,934
SO LOW AS TO BE VIRTUALLY

224
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,467
NONEXISTENT, LIKE, "DON'T TELL

225
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:36,867
YOUR SUPPORTERS THAT YOU HATE

226
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:38,400
THEIR STUPID CITY," OR

227
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:39,567
"DON'T SAY EVERYONE IN THE

228
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:40,743
AUDIENCE IS MORE RACIST THAN

229
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:41,976
YOU, " OR " DON'T HIRE A PERSONAL

230
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,066
NO

231
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,142
ATTORNEY WHO FALLS FOR A BORAT

232
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,633
PRANK 14 YEARS AFTER THE FIRST

233
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,843
MOVIE CAME OUT," THE UNSHAKABLE

234
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:48,133
FACT IS, UNLESS YOU SET THE BAR

235
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,834
AT "NOBODY CAUGHT FIRE,"

236
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,166
TRUMP WILL ALWAYS FIND A WAY TO

237
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:52,467
DISAPPOINT.

238
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:53,600
AND NOW THIS.

239
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:00,166
Announcer: AND NOW..

240
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:02,700
NO A MOVING TASTE OF CNBC IS

241
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:04,967
EXACTLY WHAT YOU THINK IT IS.

242
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:07,400
ANY MAN WHO REFERENCES THE

243
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,100
CLASSIC "APOCALYPSE NOW" MOVIE

244
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,367
AND THEIR LATEST RESEARCH NOTE

245
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:11,800
IS OKAY BY US.

246
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:15,967
THE HORROR, THE HORROR,

247
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:18,166
CONRAD'S "HEART OF DARKNESS."

248
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:18,633
"APOCALYPSE NOW."

249
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,333
HE WALKED THROUGH AND NOT

250
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,800
EVEN FLINCHED WITH THINGS

251
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:23,967
EXPLODING, REMINDS ME OF ROBERT

252
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:24,934
DUVALL IN "APOCALYPSE NOW."

253
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,834
AGAIN, TRYING TO SPEAK

254
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,943
POSITIVE ABOUT G.E. BECAUSE I AM

255
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:30,900
A KIND MAN AND I'M A GOOD MAN,

256
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:32,009
NOT UNLIKE "APOCALYPSE NOW."

257
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:33,934
I AM A KIND MAN, I'M A GOOD MAN.

258
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,066
THAT IS FROM "APOCALYPSE NOW."

259
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:37,867
I AM A KIND MAN, I'M A GOOD MAN,

260
00:06:37,934 --> 00:06:40,467
SAID TO ME BY THE WAY, AND

261
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,100
"APOCALYPSE NOW" AT THE END.

262
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,834
I'M A KIND MAN.

263
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,700
JUST LIKE IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE

264
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:48,400
"APOCALYPSE NOW," I WILL COIN

265
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:49,633
THIS, SELL EVERYTHING, SO THE

266
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,233
KIDS, SELL THE CAR, SELL THE

267
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,767
HOME, I'M NOT COMING BACK,

268
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:54,166
"APOCALYPSE NOW."

269
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:56,200
KIND OF LIKE THE VILLAGE

270
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:58,000
BURNING WITH NAPALM AND

271
00:06:58,066 --> 00:06:58,400
"APOCALYPSE NOW."

272
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:00,300
"APOCALYPSE NOW" SITUATION.

273
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:00,734
"APOCALYPSE NOW."

274
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,867
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN

275
00:07:02,934 --> 00:07:03,266
"APOCALYPSE NOW"?

276
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,266
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN

277
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:06,667
"APOCALYPSE NOW"?

278
00:07:06,734 --> 00:07:08,800
MANY TIMES.

279
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:09,667
John: MOVING ON.

280
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:10,776
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

281
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,133
IMMIGRATION.

282
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,734
IT'S ABSOLUTELY CENTRAL TO THE

283
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,367
AMERICAN STORY, AS IS SOMETIMES

284
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:13,967
CLUMSILY EXPRESSED IN CARTOONS

285
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,667
LIKE THIS.

286
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:17,200
THEY HEARD ABOUT A COUNTRY

287
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:20,233
WHERE LIFE MIGHT LET THEM WIN,

288
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,600
THEY PAID THE FARE TO AMERICA

289
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:26,367
AND THERE THEY MELTED IN.

290
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:29,567
LOVELY LADY LIBERTY WITH HER

291
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:33,467
BOOK OF RECIPES AND THE FINEST

292
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:36,000
ONE SHE'S GOT IS THE GREAT

293
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:39,567
AMERICAN MELTING POT.

294
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:43,900
THE GREAT AMERICAN MELTING POT.

295
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:46,767
John: OKAY, DEEPLY WEIRD

296
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,867
METAPHOR ASIDE, I WILL SAY THIS:

297
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:49,867
IF YOU'RE COOKING A BUNCH OF

298
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:51,200
HUMANS IN A MELTING POT,

299
00:07:51,266 --> 00:07:54,700
DON'T INCLUDE THE ENGLISH.

300
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:55,843
BELIEVE ME, WE'LL RUIN THE DISH.

301
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:56,910
WE'RE BLAND AND YET ALSO TOTALLY

302
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:01,400
OVERPOWERING TO THE PALATE.

303
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:02,400
WE ARE BASICALLY THE CILANTRO OF

304
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:03,300
THE HUMAN RACE.

305
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:04,376
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IMMIGRATION

306
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:04,967
REPEATEDLY ON THIS SHOW BUT

307
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:06,313
TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON

308
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,800
ASYLUM.

309
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:09,042
IT'S THE LEGAL PROCESS BY WHICH

310
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:10,367
PEOPLE WHO ARE FLEEING

311
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:11,166
PERSECUTION, AND MAKE IT TO

312
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:12,867
THE U.S., CAN APPLY TO STAY

313
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:13,300
HERE.

314
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,509
AND ASYLUM SEEKERS ARE A GROUP

315
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:15,643
THAT, IN THEORY, EVERYONE SHOULD

316
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:17,000
BE ABLE TO SUPPORT... THEY ARE

317
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:17,867
THE LITERAL HUDDLED MASSES

318
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:19,133
YEARNING TO BREATHE FREE WHO

319
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,266
THE STATUE OF LIBERTY HAS,

320
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,567
FOR CENTURIES, FRICASSEED.

321
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:24,500
BUT TRUMP IS FAMOUSLY NOT A FAN.

322
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:26,200
HE WENT ON ABOUT ASYLUM

323
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:29,300
AT LENGTH IN THURSDAY'S DEBATE,

324
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:29,900
AND HE LOVES TO RIFF ABOUT IT

325
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:30,767
WHENEVER HE GETS IN FRONT

326
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:33,800
OF A CROWD.

327
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:37,734
THE ASYLUM PROGRAM IS A SCAM.

328
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,100
SOME OF THE ROUGHEST PEOPLE

329
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,600
YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

330
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:42,800
PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE THEY

331
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:45,667
SHOULD BE FIGHTING FOR THE UFC.

332
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,633
THEY READ A LITTLE PAGE GIVEN

333
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,633
BY LAWYERS.

334
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,266
I AM VERY FEARFUL FOR MY LIFE.

335
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,066
I AM VERY WORRIED THAT I WILL BE

336
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:59,767
ACCOSTED IF I WAS SENT BACK

337
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:00,834
HOME.

338
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,734
OH, GIVE HIM ASYLUM.

339
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,300
HE'S AFRAID.

340
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:06,200
HE'S AFRAID.

341
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:07,567
WE DON'T LOVE THE FACT HE'S GOT

342
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:09,934
TATTOOS ON HIS FACE.

343
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,800
John: OKAY, THERE'S A LOT TO

344
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:12,500
UNPACK THERE, STARTING WITH

345
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:13,676
THE FACT THAT TRUMP SEEMS TO

346
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,000
THINK PEOPLE WITH FACIAL TATTOOS

347
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:16,900
ARE JUST INHERENTLY SCARY,

348
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:17,976
SOMETHING DEFINITIVELY DISPROVEN

349
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,467
BY THE EXISTENCE OF POST MALONE.

350
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:21,900
HE LOOKS LIKE A BUILD-A-BEAR

351
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:23,233
WHO SPENT TOO MUCH TIME AT

352
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,467
THE TATTOO STATION.

353
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:26,600
ALSO, AS YOU PROBABLY GUESSED,

354
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,400
THE ASYLUM PROCESS ISN'T

355
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:29,600
A SIMPLE RECITATION OF MAGIC

356
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:31,000
WORDS, BY WHICH ALL MANNER OF

357
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:31,533
FRAUDULENT CLAIMS ARE LET

358
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
THROUGH.

359
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:34,409
NOR IS IT RESPONSIBLE FOR, AS

360
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:35,700
TRUMP'S OFFICIAL WHITE HOUSE

361
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:37,533
WEBSITE CALLS IT, "THE BIGGEST

362
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,609
LOOPHOLE TO GAIN ENTRY INTO OUR

363
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:42,533
GREAT COUNTRY."

364
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,667
THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE.

365
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:44,834
HISTORICALLY, THE BIGGEST

366
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,100
LOOPHOLE HAS BEEN TO BE

367
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,633
THE PARENTS OF SOMEONE

368
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,500
THAT DONALD TRUMP WISHES WOULD

369
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:49,767
FUCK HIM.

370
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:51,133
AND FOR THE RECORD, ASYLUM

371
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,242
SEEKERS ARE NOT ALL TATTOOED

372
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:53,567
UFC FIGHTERS.

373
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:55,367
THEY'RE ALSO PEOPLE LIKE BERTA,

374
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:57,433
WHO FLED HONDURAS AFTER MS-13

375
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,867
GANG MEMBERS TRIED TO FORCE HER

376
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:00,500
12-YEAR-OLD GRANDDAUGHTER INTO

377
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:01,767
MARRIAGE.

378
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,533
BERTA REFUSED, THEY THREATENED

379
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,867
TO SET HER ON FIRE, SO SHE AND

380
00:10:04,934 --> 00:10:05,767
HER GRANDDAUGHTER FLED TO

381
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:06,600
THE U.S.

382
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:07,734
THEY WERE SEPARATED,

383
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
BERTA WAS DETAINED,

384
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:09,876
AND I'LL LET HER LAWYER PICK

385
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,066
THE STORY UP FROM THERE.

386
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:14,300
BERTA, MY CLIENT, SHE'S

387
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:15,700
A 63-YEAR-OLD GRANDMOTHER

388
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:16,800
WHO LEGALLY ENTERED

389
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,433
THE UNITED STATES.

390
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,133
AND SHE'S FLEEING FOR HER LIFE,

391
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,066
BUT SHE DID IT THE CORRECT WAY.

392
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:20,467
WHY?

393
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:21,576
'CAUSE SHE WENT TO THE PORT OF

394
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,934
ENTRY AND BASICALLY TURNED

395
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,200
HERSELF IN.

396
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:25,834
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE WAS HIDING,

397
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,800
SHE WAS TRYING TO BE SMUGGLED

398
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:28,500
IN THE TRUNK OF A CAR.

399
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:30,400
SHE DID IT THE RIGHT WAY.

400
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:33,100
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR 17 MONTHS.

401
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,433
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR A LONG TIME

402
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,834
ALREADY.

403
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,100
I DON'T KNOW WHY IMMIGRATION

404
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,333
WON'T LET ME LEAVE.

405
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,600
I DON'T OWE ANYTHING.

406
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,233
ONLY BECAUSE I CAME TO ASK FOR

407
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,967
PROTECTION FROM THIS COUNTRY.

408
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:51,109
John: THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

409
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:51,900
IF YOU ASKED THE COPS FOR HELP,

410
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:52,633
AND THEY RESPONDED BY THROWING

411
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,710
YOU INTO DETENTION, YOU'D BE

412
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:55,166
ABSOLUTELY FURIOUS.

413
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:56,734
YOU'D PROBABLY ALSO BE BLACK,

414
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,700
BUT LET'S TRY AND TAKE THIS

415
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:58,867
ONE SYSTEMIC SOCIAL CRISIS

416
00:10:58,934 --> 00:11:00,200
AT A TIME.

417
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:01,066
AND BERTA'S STORY ISN'T EVEN

418
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:02,166
A ONE-OFF.

419
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:03,934
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S

420
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,333
ATTACK ON ASYLUM HAS BEEN

421
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,300
FOCUSED, DEDICATED, AND

422
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,100
DEEPLY RESOURCEFUL.

423
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,600
AND I KNOW THOSE AREN'T

424
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:10,567
ADJECTIVES YOU'RE USED

425
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:11,400
TO ASSOCIATING WITH THIS

426
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:12,900
ADMINISTRATION.

427
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:14,109
BUT IN THIS ONE AREA, THEY'VE

428
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,667
BEEN TRULY DISCIPLINED ABOUT

429
00:11:15,734 --> 00:11:16,934
BEING TRULY EVIL.

430
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,300
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT OUR

431
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:19,834
ASYLUM SYSTEM.

432
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,867
HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK, AND

433
00:11:21,934 --> 00:11:24,100
JUST A FEW OF THE KEY WAYS THIS

434
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,033
ADMINISTRATION HAS UNDERMINED

435
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,767
IT.

436
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:26,767
AND LET'S START WITH HOW IT'S

437
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:28,767
SUPPOSED TO WORK AT OUR BORDER.

438
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:29,834
IDEALLY, AN ASYLUM SEEKER

439
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,133
PRESENTS THEMSELVES TO ASK

440
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,066
FOR PROTECTION, AND AN OFFICER

441
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:35,000
PERFORMS A "CREDIBLE FEAR

442
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:38,133
SCREENING."

443
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,800
IF THERE IS A CHANCE THEY MIGHT

444
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:39,633
FACE DANGER IF THEY'RE SENT BACK

445
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,876
HOME, THEY'RE ALLOWED TO REMAIN

446
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,433
IN THE U.S. PENDING A DATE IN

447
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,300
IMMIGRATION COURT.

448
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:44,467
WHICH MAKES SENSE.

449
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:46,166
WHEN A PERSON SAYS THEIR LIFE'S

450
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:47,900
AT STAKE, YOU WANT TO ERR ON

451
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:49,007
THE SIDE OF BELIEVING THEM

452
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:49,700
WHILE YOU WEIGH THE FACTS OF

453
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:50,834
THEIR CASE.

454
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,767
IF SOMEONE SAYS "I'M DROWNING,"

455
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:53,910
YOUR FIRST MOVE SHOULD BE TO

456
00:11:53,934 --> 00:11:55,467
HELP THEM OUT OF THE POOL, NOT

457
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:56,767
LEAVE THEM IN THERE WHILE YOU

458
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:57,700
CONVENE A HEARING TO DETERMINE

459
00:11:57,767 --> 00:11:58,533
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE A FISH

460
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,700
WHO IS LYING.

461
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:01,100
NOW YOU SHOULD KNOW, EVEN BEFORE

462
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,533
TRUMP, THE ODDS OF BEING GRANTED

463
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,700
ASYLUM WERE NOT GREAT, WITH

464
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:05,066
IMMIGRATION ADVOCATES SAYING

465
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:07,133
LESS THAN HALF OF ALL CLAIMS

466
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,400
ARE GRANTED.

467
00:12:10,467 --> 00:12:11,367
NOW THAT IS PARTLY BECAUSE... AS

468
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:12,476
WE'VE DISCUSSED BEFORE... MANY

469
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,300
MIGRANTS DON'T HAVE A LAWYER TO

470
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,133
HELP THEM NAVIGATE A COMPLICATED

471
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:16,133
PROCESS.

472
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:17,133
AND IT'S PARTLY BECAUSE THE BAR

473
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,333
TO QUALIFY FOR ASYLUM IS HIGH.

474
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,934
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PROVE

475
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,300
YOU'RE BEING PERSECUTED ON

476
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,266
THE BASIS OF RACE, RELIGION,

477
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,400
NATIONALITY, MEMBERSHIP

478
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:28,300
IN A SOCIAL GROUP, OR POLITICAL

479
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:28,900
OPINION.

480
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:29,800
AND THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO

481
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:30,700
BE ROOM FOR INTERPRETATION

482
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:31,667
THERE.

483
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:32,533
WHAT QUALIFIES AS MEMBERSHIP IN

484
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,867
A SOCIAL GROUP OR A POLITICAL

485
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:35,266
OPINION?

486
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,867
FOR INSTANCE, SOMEONE BEING

487
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:38,066
PERSECUTED FOR CRITICIZING

488
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,209
A DRUG CARTEL MIGHT WELL ARGUE

489
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:40,400
THAT THEIR CRITICISM IS

490
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:41,800
POLITICAL IF THEY LIVE

491
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:43,100
IN A NARCO-STATE.

492
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,767
BUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS

493
00:12:44,834 --> 00:12:47,000
TOLD IMMIGRATION JUDGES TO APPLY

494
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,967
THE CRITERIA VERY NARROWLY, AS

495
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:49,900
THIS ATTORNEY EXPLAINS TO A ROOM

496
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:53,033
FULL OF ASYLUM SEEKERS.

497
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,400
THE ASYLUM PROCESS DOES NOT

498
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:57,333
PROTECT EVERYONE.

499
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,200
CASES THAT PERTAIN TO CARTELS OR

500
00:12:59,266 --> 00:13:01,300
GANGS EXTORTING YOU ARE ALMOST

501
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:07,934
IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN.

502
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,934
UH-HUH?

503
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,467
I HAVE A PROBLEM IN MY

504
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:12,233
COUNTRY.

505
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,300
I CAN'T GO BACK.

506
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:14,967
THIS IS VERY COMMON.

507
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:16,209
THEY ALREADY KILLED FAMILY WHO

508
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:19,367
DIDN'T PAY.

509
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:20,600
CRIMINALITY ISN'T PROTECTED.

510
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,166
YOU'RE SAYING WE CAN ONLY

511
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:25,633
PROVE IT IF WE TURN UP DEAD?

512
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,900
EVEN THEN, IF IT'S NOT

513
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:29,133
THE RIGHT REASON, IT'S NOT

514
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,934
PROTECTED.

515
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,667
John: WOW.

516
00:13:33,734 --> 00:13:35,166
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S MORE JARRING

517
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:35,767
THERE, THAT MAN'S PITCH-BLACK

518
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:36,700
JOKE ABOUT GETTING MURDERED OR

519
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:37,600
THE LAWYER TAKING IT AT COMPLETE

520
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,567
FACE VALUE.

521
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:40,767
"HA, THAT'S VERY FUNNY, BUT

522
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:41,914
SERIOUSLY, IF YOU COULD DIE

523
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:42,633
HOLDING DOCUMENTATION THAT YOU

524
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,266
WERE MURDERED FOR YOUR RELIGION,

525
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,443
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE A BIG

526
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:45,600
HELP."

527
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:47,467
SO THE ASYLUM PROCESS HAS NEVER

528
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:48,834
BEEN EASY.

529
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,467
BUT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE

530
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:52,133
IT ABSOLUTE HELL.

531
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,734
THEIR POLICY OF FAMILY

532
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,066
SEPARATION CAUSED WIDESPREAD

533
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:57,433
OUTRAGE, BUT THEY'VE DONE SO

534
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,700
MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

535
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:01,433
AND IT'S WORTH SLOWING DOWN TO

536
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,834
LOOK AT THREE TACTICS THEY'VE

537
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,133
USED IN PARTICULAR.

538
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,400
MIGRANT PROTECTION PROTOCOLS,

539
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:06,934
"SAFE THIRD COUNTRY AGREEMENTS,"

540
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,500
AND TITLE 42.

541
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:09,800
AND I KNOW NONE OF THOSE HAVE

542
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:12,033
THE HARROWING RING OF

543
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,467
"FAMILY SEPARATION," BUT EACH

544
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:15,066
REPRESENTS ANOTHER CRUEL,

545
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:16,209
CALCULATED DECISION THAT HAS

546
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:18,200
LARGELY FLOWN UNDER THE RADAR.

547
00:14:18,266 --> 00:14:19,543
AND LET'S START WITH THE MIGRANT

548
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,834
PROTECTION PROTOCOLS, OR, AS

549
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,834
THEY'RE MORE COMMONLY KNOWN,

550
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,667
THE "REMAIN IN MEXICO" PROGRAM.

551
00:14:24,734 --> 00:14:26,533
VERY BASICALLY, THIS POLICY

552
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,000
FORCES ASYLUM SEEKERS TO WAIT IN

553
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:29,834
MEXICO FOR THEIR CASES TO FULLY

554
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,400
PLAY OUT IN U.S. IMMIGRATION

555
00:14:31,467 --> 00:14:32,967
COURT RATHER THAN ADMIT THEM TO

556
00:14:33,033 --> 00:14:34,367
SAFETY FIRST.

557
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:36,033
WE'VE ALREADY DONE THIS TO OVER

558
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,867
67,000 PEOPLE, MANY OF WHOM

559
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:39,700
WOUND UP IN MAKESHIFT CAMPS

560
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:41,333
THAT HAVE EMERGED AT THE BORDER.

561
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,500
AND SINCE WE STARTED LIMITING

562
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:46,100
THE NUMBER EVEN ALLOWED TO ASK

563
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,533
FOR ASYLUM AT THE BORDER EACH

564
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,700
DAY, IN SOME PLACES, THE

565
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:50,266
MIGRANTS THEMSELVES HAD TO WORK

566
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,567
OUT A SYSTEM FOR WHOSE TURN IT

567
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:53,200
WAS NEXT.

568
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:55,166
THE LIST IS A STRANGE THING.

569
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:56,600
VOLUNTEERS WHO ARE MIGRANTS

570
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:57,767
THEMSELVES KEEP THEM IN A

571
00:14:57,834 --> 00:14:59,333
NOTEPAD IN THE MEXICAN BORDER

572
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,600
CITY OF TIJUANA.

573
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:01,567
IT DETERMINES THE ORDER IN WHICH

574
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:03,400
THE THOUSANDS OF ASYLUM SEEKERS

575
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:04,433
HERE WILL BE SEEN BY U.S.

576
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:07,734
OFFICIALS.

577
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,967
NO ONE KNOWS EXACTLY WHO

578
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,200
STARTED IT OR WHEN, BUT IT'S

579
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:15,200
EVOLVED INTO A SYSTEM TO TRY AND

580
00:15:15,266 --> 00:15:17,033
KEEP ORDER AS THE U.S. HAS

581
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,300
SLOWED UP THE PROCESSING OF

582
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:18,900
ASYLUM CLAIMS.

583
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:20,367
John: LOOK, THERE ARE PLENTY

584
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:20,934
OF THINGS YOU'D EXPECT TO BE

585
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,567
HAND-WRITTEN IN A COLLEGE RULED

586
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:22,400
NOTEBOOK.

587
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:23,266
MATH HOMEWORK, SURE.

588
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,166
A LIST OF THE CUTEST BOYS IN

589
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:25,533
HOMEROOM, NATCH.

590
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,676
JUST AN ABSOLUTE SHITLOAD OF

591
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,100
COOL Ss?

592
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,166
YOU KNOW IT.

593
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:30,567
WHAT YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT WOULD

594
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:31,200
BE THE NAMES OF THOUSANDS OF

595
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:32,800
FAMILIES FOR WHOM THIS SCRAP OF

596
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:33,367
NOTEBOOK PAPER IS THEIR ONLY

597
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,100
LIFELINE TO SAFETY.

598
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,242
BECAUSE HOW THE FUCK HAVE WE LET

599
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:36,734
THAT BE THE BEST SYSTEM

600
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,900
AVAILABLE TO THEM?

601
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:40,533
AND CONDITIONS ON THE BORDER CAN

602
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,934
BE DIRE.

603
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,867
IN FEBRUARY, MORE THAN 2500

604
00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:45,233
MIGRANTS WERE LIVING IN A CAMP

605
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,900
IN MATAMOROS, WHERE THERE WAS

606
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:48,000
ONLY ONE TOILET FOR EVERY

607
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:48,967
60 PEOPLE, AND SAFE DRINKING

608
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:51,266
WATER WAS SCARCE.

609
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,767
AND EVEN PEOPLE WHO DON'T WIND

610
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:54,667
UP IN THOSE CAMPS CAN BE IN

611
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:56,066
REAL JEOPARDY.

612
00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:59,900
BECAUSE MIGRANTS IN GENERAL CAN

613
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:01,033
BE TARGETS FOR CARTELS WHO

614
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:01,867
REGULARLY KIDNAP AND TRY TO

615
00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:02,633
EXTRACT RANSOM MONEY FROM THOSE

616
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,467
THEY SUSPECT OF HAVING FAMILY IN

617
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:05,533
THE U.S.

618
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,266
THIS IS DONE SO OFTEN, THERE'S A

619
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,934
WHOLE SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR IT, AS

620
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,800
THIS CARTEL MEMBER EXPLAINS.

621
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:12,700
WE JUST PULL PEOPLE OFF THE

622
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:14,433
STREETS, TAKE THEM INTO A SAFE

623
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,166
HOUSE.

624
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:18,700
WE REACH THEIR FAMILIES IN THE

625
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:21,333
UNITED STATES TO ASK FOR MONEY.

626
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,500
HOW MUCH MONEY ARE WE TALKING

627
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,233
HERE?

628
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,900
ALL THE WAY FROM $10,000 TO

629
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:31,800
$20,000 AMERICAN DOLLARS.

630
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:33,500
WE KNOW THEY CAN AFFORD IT.

631
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:35,467
THAT'S WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO.

632
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:37,367
WHAT IF THEY DON'T PAY?

633
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:38,300
WELL, THEY END UP WHERE THEY

634
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:39,266
END UP.

635
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,443
John: "THEY END UP WHERE THEY

636
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:41,967
END UP."

637
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:42,900
HE'S TALKING ABOUT MURDER

638
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:44,667
VICTIMS WITH THE SAME CASUALNESS

639
00:16:44,734 --> 00:16:45,233
MOST PEOPLE RESERVE FOR LOST

640
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,133
SOCKS.

641
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,700
AND AS OF MAY, THERE WERE OVER A

642
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:50,567
THOUSAND PUBLICLY REPORTED CASES

643
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:51,633
OF MURDER, RAPE, TORTURE,

644
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,066
KIDNAPPING, AND OTHER VIOLENT

645
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:55,667
ASSAULTS AGAINST ASYLUM SEEKERS

646
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:56,943
AND MIGRANTS FORCED BY THE U.S.,

647
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:58,367
COMPLETELY UNNECESSARILY, TO

648
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:00,500
WAIT IN MEXICO.

649
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:02,100
IN FACT, KIDNAPPINGS ARE SUCH A

650
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,467
FACT OF LIFE, CARTELS WILL GIVE

651
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:05,676
SOME KIDNAPPED MIGRANTS A CODE

652
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,000
WORD UPON RELEASE, SO IF THEY'RE

653
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:08,867
KIDNAPPED AGAIN, THE KEYWORD

654
00:17:08,934 --> 00:17:10,200
WOULD INDICATE THAT THEY'D

655
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:12,266
ALREADY PAID THE RANSOM.

656
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,800
AND IT'S PRETTY BLEAK WHEN

657
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,600
DRUG CARTELS HAVE A MORE

658
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:16,900
EFFICIENT SYSTEM FOR KEEPING

659
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:18,009
TRACK OF ASYLUM SEEKERS THAN

660
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:19,467
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

661
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:21,433
AND YET DESPITE THE WRECKAGE

662
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,867
THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS CAUSED,

663
00:17:23,934 --> 00:17:25,009
IT'S TRUMPETED ITS "REMAIN IN

664
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:25,800
MEXICO" PROGRAM AS A GREAT

665
00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:26,734
SUCCESS.

666
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,300
IN FACT, CHAD WOLF... ACTING

667
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:30,200
SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY

668
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:32,000
AND UNDISPUTED CHADDIEST WOLF...

669
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:33,209
HAS TOUTED IT, USING A PRETTY

670
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:34,967
WEIRD METRIC.

671
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:36,500
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS ABOUT

672
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:37,166
HALF OF THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT

673
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:38,276
ARE PUT IN THE PROGRAM NEVER

674
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,633
SHOW UP FOR THEIR COURT

675
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:40,900
HEARINGS.

676
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:42,076
SO INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE PUT IN

677
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,066
THIS PROGRAM THAT KNOW THEY DO

678
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:45,242
NOT HAVE A, AGAIN, A MERITORIOUS

679
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:45,834
CLAIM, SIMPLY CHOOSE TO WALK

680
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:48,300
AWAY.

681
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,567
John: OKAY, REAL QUICK...

682
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:50,433
GET FUCKED, CHAD, YOU HUMAN

683
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,100
RAZOR BURN.

684
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,700
BECAUSE REMEMBER, THESE HEARINGS

685
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:54,633
ARE MIGRANTS' ONLY SHOT AT

686
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,633
GETTING TO SAFETY.

687
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,600
IT'S EVERYTHING THEY'VE BEEN

688
00:17:56,667 --> 00:18:00,367
WAITING FOR.

689
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:02,800
AND IF THEY MISS THEIR HEARING,

690
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:03,934
THEY LOSE THEIR CASE!

691
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,700
SO A PERSON NOT SHOWING UP

692
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:05,433
IN COURT AFTER YOU FORCE THEM

693
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,543
TO WAIT IN A DANGEROUS AREA,

694
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:07,800
WITHOUT ADEQUATE SHELTER OR

695
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:08,767
SUPPORT ISN'T PROOF THEY WERE

696
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:10,109
TRYING TO CHEAT THE SYSTEM, IT'S

697
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:11,533
PROOF YOUR SYSTEM IS NOT FUCKING

698
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,433
WORKING!

699
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,133
AND FOR THE RECORD, THE

700
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,900
GOVERNMENT CAN MAKE THESE

701
00:18:17,967 --> 00:18:21,367
HEARINGS PRETTY MS.ABLE.

702
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,133
IT MAY BEAR NO DATE OR

703
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,433
TIME, OR YOUR HEARING MAY BE

704
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,609
SCHEDULED FOR WHEN THE COURTS

705
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:25,333
AREN'T OPEN, INCLUDING ONE THAT

706
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,200
WAS SCHEDULED AT 1:00 A.M.

707
00:18:28,266 --> 00:18:29,409
IT CAN BE HARD TO KNOW ABOUT ANY

708
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:30,900
CHANGES TO DATE OF HEARINGS

709
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:32,834
GIVEN THAT SOME BORDER PATROL

710
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,333
AGENTS FILLING OUT FORMS FOR

711
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,200
MIGRANTS HAVE WRITTEN IN

712
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:38,200
"FACEBOOK" AS A STREET ADDRESS.

713
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:39,667
ALL IN ALL, THE GOVERNMENT

714
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:40,967
SYSTEM IS ABOUT AS EFFECTIVE

715
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:41,967
AS PAINTING

716
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:43,133
"MEET US AT THE PLACE" ON

717
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,133
A RACCOON AND THROWING IT

718
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,433
OVER THE WALL INTO MEXICO.

719
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,734
GOOD LUCK GETTING THE

720
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,567
INSTRUCTIONS, AND IF YOU DO,

721
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:49,867
GOOD LUCK FIGURING OUT HOW TO

722
00:18:49,934 --> 00:18:50,967
FOLLOW THEM.

723
00:18:51,033 --> 00:18:52,800
SO THIS PROGRAM ALL BUT SHUT OFF

724
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:53,533
THE PATHWAY FOR MANY ASYLUM

725
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,760
SEEKERS TO ENTER THE COUNTRY.

726
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,633
BUT THAT SEEMINGLY WASN'T

727
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,567
ENOUGH, BECAUSE THE

728
00:18:56,633 --> 00:18:58,233
ADMINISTRATION THEN CAME UP WITH

729
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,333
"SAFE THIRD COUNTRY" AGREEMENTS.

730
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,000
BASICALLY, THE U.S. MANAGED

731
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:04,209
TO FORCE HONDURAS, GUATEMALA,

732
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:05,400
AND EL SALVADOR TO SIGN UP TO

733
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:07,934
THIS.

734
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,266
AND IT MEANT THAT WE COULD BAR

735
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,166
MIGRANTS FROM SEEKING ASYLUM

736
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:11,133
HERE, AND SEND THEM TO APPLY FOR

737
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,200
IT IN THOSE COUNTRIES INSTEAD.

738
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:14,667
WHICH IS COMPLETELY ABSURD,

739
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:16,333
SINCE FOR MANY MIGRANTS, THOSE

740
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,033
ARE THE EXACT COUNTRIES THEY'RE

741
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,200
SEEKING ASYLUM FROM.

742
00:19:21,266 --> 00:19:23,367
"OH, YOU'RE FLEEING HONDURAS?

743
00:19:23,433 --> 00:19:24,000
WHY NOT TRY EL SALVADOR!

744
00:19:24,066 --> 00:19:24,800
IT'S RIGHT NEXT DOOR SO YOU CAN

745
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:25,667
STAY IN TOUCH WITH FAMILY,

746
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:26,810
FRIENDS, AND THE PEOPLE WHO WANT

747
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:27,767
TO MURDER YOU!"

748
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,533
AND IF THAT WASN'T BAD ENOUGH,

749
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,667
NONE OF THESE THREE COUNTRIES

750
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:33,600
HAVE ROBUST ASYLUM SYSTEMS, AS

751
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:34,533
THE PRESIDENT OF EL SALVADOR

752
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,934
HIMSELF ADMITS.

753
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,200
A MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENT'S

754
00:19:38,266 --> 00:19:39,276
INNER CIRCLE SAID THAT ASYLUM

755
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,166
SEEKERS COULD END UP STAYING IN

756
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:42,734
EL SALVADOR, THAT THAT COULD

757
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,400
HAPPEN.

758
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:45,200
IS EL SALVADOR PREPARED FOR

759
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:46,900
THAT?

760
00:19:46,967 --> 00:19:49,033
WELL, NOT RIGHT NOW.

761
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,467
WE DON'T HAVE ASYLUM CAPACITIES,

762
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:53,166
BUT WE CAN BUILD THEM.

763
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:53,867
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE IT NOW.

764
00:19:53,934 --> 00:19:54,834
WE DON'T HAVE IT NOW.

765
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,900
WHEN WE HAVE IT...

766
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:56,633
AND IF HE SAID, "I CAN THROW

767
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,133
UP A TENT."

768
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,700
A TENT?

769
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:58,433
THAT'S NOT... THAT'S NOT ASYLUM

770
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,233
CAPACITY.

771
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,200
NO.

772
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,133
John: NO.

773
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,066
NO, IT REALLY ISN'T.

774
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:04,142
THROWING UP A TENT DOESN'T

775
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:04,834
INHERENTLY GIVE YOU ASYLUM

776
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,567
CAPACITY.

777
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:06,934
THERE ARE ONLY TWO THINGS

778
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:09,834
SHELTER FROM THE ELEMENTS, AND

779
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,767
THE ARENA FOR A SHAME-BASED

780
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:12,433
BAKING CRUCIBLE WHOSE ONLY PRIZE

781
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,540
IS THE NARROW AVOIDANCE OF

782
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:15,333
PUBLIC FAILURE.

783
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,633
WHY THE

784
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,633
FUCK DID THE NEW SEASON OF

785
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,820
"THE GREAT BRITISH BAKE-OFF"

786
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:19,876
MAKE THE FIRST SHOWSTOPPER

787
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,667
CHALLENGE "CELEBRITY CAKE

788
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:21,667
BUSTS?"

789
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:23,467
BECAUSE IT GAVE US SQUASHED

790
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:24,834
FREDDIE MERCURY, SOMETHING

791
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,467
THE BAKER INSISTED WAS

792
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:28,033
LUPITA NYONG'O, AND A

793
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,033
PHOTO PERFECT DAVID BOWIE.

794
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,934
THAT BAKER DESERVES

795
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,400
A PAUL HOLLYWOOD HANDSHAKE.

796
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,133
THE REST OF YOU NEED TO THINK

797
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,367
ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

798
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,500
AND FORCING MIGRANTS TO SIT IN

799
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:39,734
REFUGEE CAMPS OR SENDING THEM

800
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,633
TO COUNTRIES WITH

801
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,300
NON-FUNCTIONING ASYLUM SYSTEMS

802
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,300
IS COMFORTABLY BAD ENOUGH,

803
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,800
BEFORE YOU GET TO WHAT HAPPENED

804
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:45,734
EARLIER THIS YEAR, WHEN

805
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,133
THE ADMINISTRATION'S INVOKED

806
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,800
TITLE 42 OF THE U.S. CODE.

807
00:20:50,867 --> 00:20:52,600
AND THAT ISN'T EVEN AN

808
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:53,333
IMMIGRATION LAW.

809
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,133
IT'S A PROVISION THAT GIVES THE

810
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,800
GOVERNMENT BROAD POWER TO ACT

811
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:56,633
DURING A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS.

812
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,400
AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

813
00:20:58,467 --> 00:20:59,900
CURRENTLY CLAIMING THAT, BECAUSE

814
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:00,976
OF THE PANDEMIC, IT GIVES THEM

815
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,333
THE AUTHORITY TO SHUT DOWN THE

816
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,533
BORDER TO VIRTUALLY ALL

817
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,700
MIGRANTS.

818
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:06,066
AND NOT JUST THAT... THEY'RE

819
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:07,333
ALSO CLAIMING THAT IT ALLOWS

820
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,443
THEM TO TAKE ASYLUM SEEKERS

821
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:09,834
WHO'VE ALREADY MADE IT INTO

822
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,033
THE U.S., AND EXPEL THEM WITH NO

823
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,834
DUE PROCESS WHATSOEVER.

824
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,834
IT IS A TRANSPARENT ATTEMPT TO

825
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,700
EXPLOIT THIS PANDEMIC TO DO WHAT

826
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:20,633
THEY WANT WITH MIGRANTS...

827
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,600
ALTHOUGH, MARK MORGAN, TRUMP'S

828
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:22,707
HEAD OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER

829
00:21:22,734 --> 00:21:23,834
PROTECTION, HAS REPEATEDLY

830
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,433
INSISTED THAT NOTHING COULD

831
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,467
BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH.

832
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:28,333
TITLE 42 HAS NOTHING TO DO

833
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,934
WITH IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT.

834
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,200
I'M GONNA SAY THAT AGAIN.

835
00:21:32,266 --> 00:21:33,567
I'VE SAID IT BEFORE.

836
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:35,200
I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO SAY IT.

837
00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:36,533
TITLE 42 HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

838
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,000
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT AND

839
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:40,400
EVERYTHING TO DO WITH

840
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:41,967
PUBLIC HEALTH.

841
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:44,533
John: YEAH, MARK, WE'RE AWARE

842
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,609
YOU KEEP SAYING THIS HAS NOTHING

843
00:21:45,633 --> 00:21:48,133
TO DO WITH IMMIGRATION.

844
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,967
BUT A TRUMP OFFICIAL SAYING HIS

845
00:21:49,033 --> 00:21:50,242
ACTIONS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH

846
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:51,300
IMMIGRATION IS ABOUT AS

847
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:52,734
BELIEVABLE AS COOKIE MONSTER

848
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,700
SAYING HIS ACTIONS HAVE NOTHING

849
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:54,800
TO DO WITH COOKIES.

850
00:21:54,867 --> 00:21:55,876
BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY DO.

851
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,433
THEY'RE THE THING YOU'RE SO

852
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,667
OBSESSED WITH, IT LITERALLY

853
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,667
MAKES YOU A MONSTER.

854
00:22:00,734 --> 00:22:02,000
AND IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO TAKE

855
00:22:02,066 --> 00:22:03,700
THIS ADMINISTRATION CITING THEIR

856
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:05,467
DEEP CONCERN ABOUT THE

857
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:06,867
CORONAVIRUS, EVEN BEFORE YOU

858
00:22:06,934 --> 00:22:08,433
LEARN THAT THE CDC WAS

859
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,033
APPARENTLY FORCED TO ISSUE THE

860
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,433
TITLE 42 ORDER, DESPITE THEIR

861
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,710
OWN SCIENTISTS SAYING THERE WAS

862
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:14,667
NO EVIDENCE IT WOULD SLOW THE

863
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:16,233
CORONAVIRUS.

864
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,367
SO THIS CLEARLY HAS NOTHING TO

865
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:19,633
DO WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AT ALL.

866
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,867
AND IF YOU NEED ANY MORE PROOF,

867
00:22:21,934 --> 00:22:23,166
STEPHEN MILLER... TRUMP'S TOP

868
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:24,734
IMMIGRATION ADVISER AND WORLD'S

869
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,567
TALLEST MINION... HAS APPARENTLY

870
00:22:26,633 --> 00:22:28,567
BEEN TRYING TO INVOKE TITLE 42

871
00:22:28,633 --> 00:22:30,300
FOR IMMIGRATION PURPOSES LONG

872
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:32,033
BEFORE COVID.

873
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,667
HE REPORTEDLY PUSHED TO INVOKE

874
00:22:33,734 --> 00:22:35,200
IT TWICE LAST YEAR, ONCE WHEN

875
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:36,276
AN OUTBREAK OF MUMPS SPREAD

876
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:36,834
THROUGH IMMIGRATION DETENTION

877
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,233
FACILITIES, AND AGAIN WHEN

878
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,734
BORDER PATROL STATIONS WERE HIT

879
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,567
WITH THE FLU.

880
00:22:40,633 --> 00:22:42,200
IN FACT, USING EMERGENCY

881
00:22:42,266 --> 00:22:44,033
PUBLIC HEALTH POWERS TO CURB

882
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,433
IMMIGRATION WAS APPARENTLY ON

883
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,200
A WISH LIST THAT MILLER CRAFTED

884
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:48,376
WITHIN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF

885
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,166
THE ADMINISTRATION.

886
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:51,409
INCIDENTALLY, THE REST OF THAT

887
00:22:51,433 --> 00:22:52,734
WISH LIST WAS JUST WHAT LOOKS

888
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,843
LIKE A HAND-DRAWN PICTURE OF

889
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:55,633
A RIPPED STEPHEN MILLER AND

890
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,300
"MAYBE AN ALL-WHITE REBOOT OF

891
00:22:57,367 --> 00:22:58,533
'HIDDEN FIGURES'?"

892
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:04,700
CIRCLED THREE TIMES.

893
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:06,133
AND YOU CAN KIND OF SEE WHY THIS

894
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,800
APPEALS SO MUCH TO MILLER.

895
00:23:06,867 --> 00:23:07,667
BECAUSE INVOKING TITLE 42

896
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:08,810
HAS BASICALLY CREATED A SHADOW

897
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:09,367
DEPORTATION SYSTEM THAT MOVES

898
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:10,266
QUICKLY AND IS ACCOUNTABLE

899
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,667
TO NO ONE.

900
00:23:11,734 --> 00:23:15,033
AND THEY'VE USED IT A LOT.

901
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,467
SINCE MARCH, THERE'VE BEEN

902
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:18,600
NEARLY 200,000 EXPULSIONS IN

903
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:19,934
WHICH ASYLUM SEEKERS WERE SENT

904
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:21,233
BACK WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A COURT

905
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,633
HEARING.

906
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,940
AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS GONE OUT

907
00:23:24,967 --> 00:23:25,976
OF ITS WAY TO AVOID SCRUTINY.

908
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,400
FOR EXAMPLE, UNACCOMPANIED

909
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:28,600
MINORS ARE USUALLY KEPT IN

910
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:29,800
SHELTERS, WHERE IMMIGRATION

911
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,076
ATTORNEYS CAN FIND THEM, AND TRY

912
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,000
AND HELP THEM WITH THEIR CASE.

913
00:23:33,066 --> 00:23:34,146
BUT BY CITING PUBLIC HEALTH

914
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,276
CONCERNS, THE GOVERNMENT HAS

915
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,700
INSTEAD BEEN QUIETLY KEEPING

916
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:37,910
KIDS IN HOTELS, SUPERVISED BY

917
00:23:37,934 --> 00:23:39,100
PRIVATE CONTRACTORS.

918
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,433
AND THE RARE GLIMPSES WE'VE

919
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,166
GOTTEN OF THIS HAVE BEEN

920
00:23:43,233 --> 00:23:44,233
ABSOLUTELY CHILLING.

921
00:23:44,266 --> 00:23:45,166
JUST WATCH AS A CIVIL RIGHTS

922
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:46,066
ATTORNEY TRIES TO HELP THE KIDS

923
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:49,367
BUT GETS STOPPED.

924
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:52,266
ARE YOU POLICE?

925
00:23:52,367 --> 00:23:55,633
ARE YOU POLICE?

926
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,266
YOU CAN'T BE HERE.

927
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:59,400
CAN I ASK WHO YOU ARE?

928
00:23:59,467 --> 00:24:01,000
DESPERATELY TRYING TO

929
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,142
COMMUNICATE TO CHILDREN, THE

930
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,667
ASSOCIATED PLACE SO THEY ARE

931
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,700
BEING HELD BY THE FOURTH FLOOR

932
00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:07,433
OF THE HILTON IN SUITES HOTEL IN

933
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,033
McALLEN, TEXAS.

934
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,467
IF YOU ARE DETAINED, GIVE ME

935
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:10,967
HER NAME!

936
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,700
GET OUT OF HERE.

937
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:13,500
WHO ARE YOU?

938
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:15,700
DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHO WE ARE.

939
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:17,000
ARE YOU POLICE?

940
00:24:17,066 --> 00:24:18,200
GET OUT.

941
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:18,900
GET OUT.

942
00:24:18,967 --> 00:24:19,667
GET OUT.

943
00:24:19,734 --> 00:24:20,367
GET OUT NOW!

944
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:21,000
John: WHAT THE FUCK IS

945
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:21,700
HAPPENING THERE?

946
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:22,567
ALTHOUGH I AM CURIOUS IF, AFTER

947
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:23,300
THAT INTERACTION, THOSE MEN FELT

948
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:24,533
THEY'D SUCCESSFULLY HIDDEN

949
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,467
THE GOVERNMENT'S CHILD PRISON.

950
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:27,367
"WHEW, THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE!

951
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:28,200
I GOT A BIT WORRIED WHEN HE

952
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:29,533
ASKED "WHO ARE YOU," BUT THEN

953
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,676
RANDY SAID, "DON'T WORRY WHO WE

954
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,433
ARE."

955
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,066
NICE SAVE THERE, RANDY!

956
00:24:33,133 --> 00:24:34,266
THAT'S THE LAST TIME ANYONE

957
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,066
ASKS US QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS

958
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:35,967
MYSTERIOUSLY OFF-LIMITS HOTEL

959
00:24:36,033 --> 00:24:36,567
FLOOR PACKED WITH TERRIFIED

960
00:24:36,633 --> 00:24:39,900
CHILDREN."

961
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:41,900
NOW, INCIDENTALLY, OUR LAWYERS

962
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:43,233
ARE INSISTING THAT I HAVE TO

963
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,500
CLARIFY THAT THAT HAMPTON INN

964
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:45,500
SAID THEY HAD MADE THOSE

965
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,643
BOOKINGS WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT

966
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:47,500
THEY'D BE USED FOR, AND HAVE

967
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:48,300
CANCELED THEIR BUSINESS.

968
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:49,834
BECAUSE THE ENTITY YOU'RE

969
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,233
DEFINITELY ANGRIEST AT RIGHT NOW

970
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,500
IS THE HAMPTON FUCKING INN.

971
00:24:53,567 --> 00:24:54,900
AND WHEN YOU PUT ALL THIS

972
00:24:54,967 --> 00:24:56,133
TOGETHER, THIS ADMINISTRATION

973
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,633
HAS EFFECTIVELY TAKEN AN ASYLUM

974
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,600
SYSTEM THAT WAS ALREADY

975
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:01,900
IMPERFECT AND SHATTERED IT.

976
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:02,533
AND THE THING IS, THEY'RE NOW

977
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,300
TRYING TO MAKE THIS DAMAGE

978
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:04,200
PERMANENT.

979
00:25:04,266 --> 00:25:05,400
BECAUSE ALONG WITH EXTENDING

980
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:07,266
TITLE 42 INDEFINITELY, THEY'VE

981
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,800
DRAFTED NEW REGULATIONS THAT

982
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:10,042
WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MAKE

983
00:25:10,066 --> 00:25:11,500
IT EASIER FOR IMMIGRATION JUDGES

984
00:25:11,567 --> 00:25:12,776
TO REJECT ASYLUM REQUESTS OUT OF

985
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,133
HAND, MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT,

986
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,367
IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, TO WIN A CASE

987
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:17,333
INVOLVING GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE

988
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,667
OR GANG THREATS, AND MAKE IT SO

989
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:20,834
MIGRANTS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT

990
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,076
COMPLETE ASYLUM APPLICATIONS...

991
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,209
WHICH HAVE TO BE IN ENGLISH, AND

992
00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:24,633
WITH ALL SUPPORTING EVIDENCE...

993
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,300
WITHIN JUST 15 DAYS OF THEIR

994
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:29,367
FIRST COURT HEARING.

995
00:25:29,433 --> 00:25:30,667
AND THAT IS REGARDLESS OF

996
00:25:30,734 --> 00:25:31,567
WHETHER THEY HAVE A LAWYER.

997
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:33,200
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S

998
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:34,166
ATTACK ON THIS SYSTEM HAS JUST

999
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:34,800
BEEN RELENTLESS.

1000
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,033
AND THERE ARE LIVES AT STAKE

1001
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,300
HERE.

1002
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:38,409
REMEMBER BERTA, WHO CAME HERE TO

1003
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:39,567
PROTECT HER 12-YEAR-OLD

1004
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:41,033
GRANDDAUGHTER?

1005
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,500
JUST WATCH HER LAWYER UPDATE HER

1006
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:45,700
ON THE OUTCOME OF HER CASE.

1007
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:48,100
WELL, HERE WE ARE.

1008
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:56,166
THE COURT APPEAL WAS REJECTED.

1009
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:58,934
THEY ARE LOOKING FOR ME.

1010
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,400
AND THEY WILL KILL ME RIGHT

1011
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:03,533
AWAY.

1012
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,266
I DON'T WANT TO...

1013
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:06,166
SO YOU ARE AFRAID?

1014
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:08,033
YES.

1015
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,266
I'M SCARED.

1016
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:12,066
John: YEAH, THE GOVERNMENT,

1017
00:26:12,133 --> 00:26:15,100
ACTING ON OUR BEHALF, DEPORTED

1018
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:16,533
BERTA BACK TO HONDURAS, WHERE

1019
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,333
YOU SHOULD KNOW, SHE ONCE AGAIN

1020
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,443
FLED, AND IS CURRENTLY LIVING

1021
00:26:18,467 --> 00:26:19,967
IN LIMBO IN MEXICO.

1022
00:26:20,033 --> 00:26:21,400
AND THE TRAGIC THING IS, IN SOME

1023
00:26:21,467 --> 00:26:22,767
WAYS, SHE'S LUCKIER THAN MANY

1024
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:24,867
ASYLUM SEEKERS.

1025
00:26:24,934 --> 00:26:26,042
SHE AT LEAST HAD A LAWYER AND

1026
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:27,834
HER CASE WAS HEARD.

1027
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,600
BUT FOR SO MANY, ESPECIALLY NOW,

1028
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:31,166
THERE'S JUST NO TELLING IF OR

1029
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:33,266
WHEN THEY'LL EVEN GET THAT FAR.

1030
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:34,343
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING, "WELL,

1031
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:36,433
WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT THIS?"

1032
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,066
THERE IS ACTUALLY ONE THING YOU

1033
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:38,400
CAN DO.

1034
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:41,133
YOU CAN VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN.

1035
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,667
AND I KNOW THAT SOUNDS

1036
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:43,300
SIMPLISTIC, ESPECIALLY

1037
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:44,509
CONSIDERING THAT OUR IMMIGRATION

1038
00:26:44,533 --> 00:26:45,934
POLICY HAS BEEN PRETTY SHITTY

1039
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,300
UNDER DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS

1040
00:26:47,367 --> 00:26:48,834
TOO, LIKE THE ONE JOE BIDEN WAS

1041
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,433
IN FOR EIGHT YEARS.

1042
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,367
AND I AM NOT SAYING HE'S THE

1043
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:55,000
PERFECT CANDIDATE, FAR FROM IT.

1044
00:26:55,066 --> 00:26:56,309
I PERSONALLY FIND HIS OPPOSITION

1045
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:57,767
TO MEDICARE FOR ALL UTTERLY

1046
00:26:57,834 --> 00:26:59,066
RIDICULOUS, ESPECIALLY IN

1047
00:26:59,133 --> 00:27:00,467
THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC.

1048
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:02,200
ALSO, I THINK AVIATOR GLASSES

1049
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:03,600
SHOULD ONLY BE WORN BY

1050
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:05,133
HOT PILOTS, CUTE BABIES, AND

1051
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,567
CUTE BABY PILOTS.

1052
00:27:07,633 --> 00:27:09,100
BUT THE FACT IS, A LOT OF OUR

1053
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:10,700
IMMIGRATION POLICY IS SET SOLELY

1054
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:12,800
BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

1055
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:15,033
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW, BIDEN HAS

1056
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,300
EXPLICITLY PROMISED TO END THE

1057
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:18,467
REMAIN IN MEXICO POLICY AND

1058
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:19,576
RESTORE ASYLUM ELIGIBILITY FOR

1059
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,033
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS AND

1060
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:26,266
VICTIMS OF GANG PERSECUTION.

1061
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:27,333
AND THOSE COULD BE

1062
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,133
LIFE-SAVING CHANGES.

1063
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,834
ONE IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY WE

1064
00:27:28,867 --> 00:27:30,066
SPOKE WITH HAS SAID,

1065
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:31,900
"I SPEND HOURS EVERY DAY TELLING

1066
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:37,367
ASYLUM-SEEKERS STUCK IN MEXICO,

1067
00:27:37,433 --> 00:27:38,166
"WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL NOVEMBER

1068
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:38,567
THIRD."

1069
00:27:38,633 --> 00:27:39,333
THEY CRY.

1070
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,200
THEY PRAY.

1071
00:27:40,266 --> 00:27:41,066
THEY ASK ABOUT THE LATEST POLLS.

1072
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:41,934
I SHOW MY COUNTDOWN TIMER.

1073
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,800
THEY SHOW ME THEIR SCARS."

1074
00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:46,033
AND OBVIOUSLY, BIDEN WILL HAVE

1075
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,734
TO DO A LOT MORE, AND WE'LL HAVE

1076
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,843
TO HOLD HIM TO THE PROMISES HE'S

1077
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:49,967
MADE, BUT WE CAN'T BEGIN

1078
00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:51,300
TO FIX THE DAMAGE DONE BY THIS

1079
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:52,476
ADMINISTRATION UNTIL WE REPLACE

1080
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,734
THE ADMINISTRATION ITSELF.

1081
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,100
IF WE EVEN WANT A SHOT

1082
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:59,800
AT CHANGE, IT'S ON US TO VOTE,

1083
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:01,200
AND THEN ADVOCATE LIKE LIVES

1084
00:28:01,266 --> 00:28:02,900
DEPEND ON IT.

1085
00:28:02,967 --> 00:28:05,000
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, WE BADLY

1086
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:05,934
NEED AN ASYLUM SYSTEM THAT

1087
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,433
WORKS.

1088
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,967
AND THAT IS ONE THAT'S BASED ON

1089
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:11,200
COMPASSION, DUE PROCESS, AND OF

1090
00:28:11,266 --> 00:28:12,633
COURSE, ULTIMATELY, CANNIBALISM

1091
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,467
BY A GIANT GREEN STATUE.

1092
00:28:14,533 --> 00:28:18,900
AND NOW THIS.

1093
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:22,000
Announcer: AND NOW, LIKE WE

1094
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:23,867
SAID, THE MOVIE TASTE OF PEOPLE

1095
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:25,800
ON CNBC IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU

1096
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:26,100
THINK IT IS.

1097
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:30,166
A LOT OF THIS IS LIKE "THE

1098
00:28:30,233 --> 00:28:30,967
GODFATHER, JUST BUSINESS.

1099
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:32,967
I CALL IT THE GODFATHER THREE

1100
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:34,166
STOCK MARKET.

1101
00:28:34,233 --> 00:28:34,767
HOWEVER MUCH INVESTORS WANT TO

1102
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:36,934
GET OUT, THE PRICE STRUCTURE

1103
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,500
KEEPS PULLING THE BACK END.

1104
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:39,133
JUST WHEN I THOUGHT I WAS

1105
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,467
OUT, THEY ARE PULLING ME BACK

1106
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:41,100
IN.

1107
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:43,500
THAT IS USED A LOT.

1108
00:28:43,567 --> 00:28:44,033
"THE GODFATHER."

1109
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,333
NO, YOU PULLED ME BACK IN.

1110
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,300
I MEAN, FOR AN ABSOLUTELY AWFUL

1111
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:50,367
MOVIE, I MEAN, THAT... THAT

1112
00:28:50,433 --> 00:28:52,467
DEFINITELY IS... I MEAN,

1113
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:52,734
COMPARED...

1114
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,467
THAT IS AN AWFUL MOVIE?

1115
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:57,800
COMPARED TO G1 AND G2.

1116
00:28:57,867 --> 00:28:59,133
SPEAK ANOTHER TIME HAS COME UP

1117
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,900
TO CLEAN UP THE SHIP, TO TAKE

1118
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:03,100
CARE OF THE FAMILY BUSINESSES IN

1119
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:03,533
THE "THE GODFATHER."

1120
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,900
IT'S KIND OF LIKE

1121
00:29:05,967 --> 00:29:06,900
"THE GODFATHER" 3, NOT THAT

1122
00:29:06,967 --> 00:29:07,166
IMPORTANT.

1123
00:29:07,233 --> 00:29:08,300
AS THEY SAY IN

1124
00:29:08,367 --> 00:29:09,133
"THE GODFATHER," THIS IS THE

1125
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,734
LIFE WE CHOSE.

1126
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,667
I WAS REMINDED BY THE

1127
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:13,233
SOLILOQUY THAT MARLON BRANDO

1128
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:17,767
GIVES ABOUT SONNY SAYING THINGS

1129
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:19,066
YOU SHOULDN'T SAY, HOTHEADED.

1130
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:22,500
IS THAT "ON THE WATERFRONT?"

1131
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:24,667
"ON THE WATERFRONT?"

1132
00:29:24,734 --> 00:29:26,433
I DON'T WASH DIANE KEATON

1133
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,333
MOVIES BECAUSE HER CHARACTER

1134
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,400
ABORTED MICHAEL CORLEONE'S BABY

1135
00:29:31,467 --> 00:29:31,834
AND "THE GODFATHER."

1136
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,166
I CAN RELATE THAT BACK TO THE

1137
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:35,500
DISNEY SITCOM.

1138
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,100
John: THAT'S OUR SHOW.

1139
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:38,300
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:29:38,367 --> 00:29:39,700

1141
00:29:39,767 --> 00:29:40,767
