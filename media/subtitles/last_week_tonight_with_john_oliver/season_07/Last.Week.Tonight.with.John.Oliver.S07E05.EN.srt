00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,200
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,560
SEASON VII
EPISODE 5

3
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,440
Hello, there !
Well, well, well...

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,680
This is weird, isn't it ?
This is definitely weird.

5
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,000
As you can clearly tell,

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,440
this is not going to be
our usual show for this week.

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,520
For a start,
there is no audience,

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,120
and also, we're not
even in our usual studio.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,800
Partly 'cause we do like to shake
things up a bit whenever we can

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,600
and also partly because our actual
studio might be full of coronavirus.

11
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,880
I'm actually serious about that.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,640
Both the place where
we normally tape on Sunday

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,960
and our office building
had confirmed cases of coronavirus.

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,920
So, our staff has been working
from home

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and we're currently
taping this somewhere else

16
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,520
with a very limited crew
on this white void set

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,160
that kind of looks like the place movie
characters go when they've just died

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,600
or where they shot
the Kars-For-Kids commercial.

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,960
Very much, by the way,
the coronavirus of commercials,

20
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,160
in that it is horrifically
infectious and ruins people's lives.

21
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,920
We're not the only ones who've had
to make big adjustments to our lives.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,800
This was the week that the coronavirus,
for many people here in the U.S.,

23
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,040
seemed to go from an abstraction
to a very real threat.

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,440
And maybe the best sign of just
how fast it all happened came,

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,760
as it always seems to, from
Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz.

26
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,720
The Utah Jazz basketball team
will be quarantined in Oklahoma City

27
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,720
for the foreseeable future,
that according to ESPN.

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,760
Before the game, Rudy Gobert
spoke to the Utah media,

29
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,640
joking about possibly being sick
and then did this.

30
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,720
Making a point to touch every
microphone and recorder.

31
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,560
Hours later, we got the news that
he test positive for the coronavirus.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yeah, of course he fucking did !
Nice work there, Rudy !

33
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,120
I would say that that feels
too stupid to actually be real,

34
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,880
but let's try and remember
that this is also the timeline

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,840
in which the official White House
Twitter account once tweeted:

36
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,480
"First snow of the year !"
on a 63-degree day,

37
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,440
on which, and this is true,
it did not snow.

38
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,320
So, honestly in many ways,

39
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,480
what Rudy Gobert did was
actually just stupid enough.

40
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,160
Now, that happened on Monday
and things spiraled from there.

41
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,840
America's major sports
were suspended, as was hockey.

42
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,040
March Madness was canceled,

43
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,640
and as if that weren't enough,
Rita Wilson and her husband Tom,

44
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,040
hashtag #Feminism,

45
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,760
announced that they had tested
positive for the coronavirus.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,040
We've also learned political figures
from all over have tested positive,

47
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,640
including an Iranian vice president,
a U.K. health minister

48
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,360
and the mayor of Miami.

49
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,080
And that is just at the time
that we are taping this.

50
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,200
We are in the midst
of a rapidly-escalating outbreak

51
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,000
and it's very difficult to say
exactly where things stand.

52
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,400
Especially because, despite
Trump repeatedly claiming otherwise,

53
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,920
tests for this virus
are still not available,

54
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,880
in most places,
to those who need them.

55
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,160
Which means that we can't yet
properly track the virus

56
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,000
or know
how quickly it is spreading.

57
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,960
And that is not only catastrophic

58
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,880
because we're having to fly
blind in fighting this pandemic,

59
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,920
it's also deeply frustrating.

60
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,880
Especially when you see how quickly
other countries like South Korea

61
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,320
ramped up their testing capabilities.

62
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,080
And that is part of the reason
why it was actually refreshing

63
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,360
to hear the top U.S. official on
infectious diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci,

64
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,520
say this
about our current testing system.

65
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,120
The system is not really
geared to what we need right now.

66
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,040
- That is a failing.
- A failing ? Yes.

67
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,480
Yeah, it is a failing. Let's admit it.
The idea of anybody getting it easily,

68
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,680
the way people in other country are
doing it, we're not set up for that.

69
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,760
Do I think we should be ?
Yes. But we're not.

70
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,320
No, we are not.

71
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,440
And incidentally, if you find yourself
really appreciating how calm,

72
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,920
knowledgeable,
and thorough Fauci is,

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,920
you're frankly
not alone on that !

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,800
He has been a rare source of clarity
in the Trump administration's response.

75
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,880
You should know, he is the nation's
leading infectious disease expert.

76
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,520
Is he my favorite infectious disease
expert ? No, of course he isn't.

77
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,760
Because that would be
Salvador Mazza.

78
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,920
And it is amazing that for a man

79
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,800
who studied
infectious diseases his whole life,

80
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,920
the only thing
he ever came down with

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,280
was a deadly case
of bedroom eyes.

82
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,360
Salvador, stop it !

83
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,680
Fauci is in a tough position
right now.

84
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,800
He has to balance the task
of communicating real, honest science

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,640
with this administration's aversion
to every one of those words.

86
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,080
But so far,
he seems to be doing a good job.

87
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,000
The same, unfortunately,
cannot be said about Trump,

88
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,400
who attempted to reassure the nation
with a sedated Oval Office speech

89
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,160
which was a complete mess.

90
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,680
Despite the fact he was reading
from a prepared statement,

91
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,480
he managed to mistakenly claim that
imports from Europe were being cut off,

92
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,800
which they were not,

93
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,920
that insurers would waive
co-pays not just for testing,

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,680
but for treatment,
which at present they won't.

95
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,160
And he seemed to imply
that Americans in Europe

96
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,120
could not get back into the country,
which they can.

97
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,520
And even he didn't seem entirely
satisfied with his performance.

98
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,040
The moment the speech was over,
this was his actual reaction.

99
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,320
- We're clear.
- Okay ? Okaaaay.

100
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,000
Yup. And that is the "Okaaaay"

101
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,200
of a man who has just completed
yet another substandard job

102
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,160
after refusing to put in
even the slightest bit of effort.

103
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,160
She knows
what I'm talking about.

104
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,080
She definitely knows
what I'm talking about.

105
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,720
This joke is landing so hard
with her right now.

106
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,280
And for the following days,
Trump seemed to be doing his very best

107
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,200
to try and minimize
the impact of this crisis,

108
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,560
often with a particular focus
on shoring up the stock market,

109
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,360
a dynamic perhaps best encapsulated
by this exchange with a reporter.

110
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,000
The markets
are going to be just fine.

111
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,120
Why do you say that ?
They're tanking.

112
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,200
I hate it when the president lies
as much as the next guy,

113
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,400
but why would you ask him:
"Why do you say that ?"

114
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,200
Because the answer to that
is always: it's just what he does !

115
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,080
Asking Trump why he says things
are fine when they're obviously not

116
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,320
is like asking the wind
why it whispers

117
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,120
or why the old redwood tree
grows so tall,

118
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,360
or why this corgi is so thicc.

119
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,600
That's just nature, baby.
It is what it is.

120
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,120
But again, nothing is fine here.
The president's response has, sadly,

121
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,520
been characterized
by disorganization and lies.

122
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,200
And the all time low, so far,

123
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,440
came in his Rose Garden
press conference on Friday.

124
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,680
If you saw news coverage
after the fact,

125
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,920
you may have seen
he declared a national emergency.

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,120
Which is good.

127
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,000
If that's all you saw of the conference
you might've been reassured.

128
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,400
But,
if you watched the whole event,

129
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,520
there was a lot there
that was pretty concerning.

130
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,400
'Cause Trump also, inexplicably,
felt it important to bring up

131
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,120
a series of CEOs whose companies
were promising

132
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,280
to help increase
our testing capability

133
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,800
and who absolutely
did not need to be there.

134
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,800
Especially because for some reason,
Trump defied every health protocol

135
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,360
by shaking their hands,
patting their backs

136
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,800
and touching the microphone
at least 31 times,

137
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,960
despite the fact he'd been exposed
to people with the virus himself

138
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,560
last weekend at Mar-a-Lago,
where a growing number of guests

139
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,360
have since tested positive.

140
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,040
Which, by the way, is the rare
instance of the word "positive"

141
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,440
being associated with any
experience at Mar-a-Lago.

142
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,600
But perhaps
the most emblematic response

143
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,640
was when he was asked about
the country's disastrous lag in testing

144
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,000
and said:
"I don't take responsibility at all."

145
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,720
and then had this exchange
with a reporter.

146
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,400
You said
that you don't take responsibility,

147
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,320
but you did disband
the White House Pandemic Office

148
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,400
and the officials in that office
left this administration abruptly.

149
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,880
So, what responsibility
do you take to that ?

150
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,600
The officials in that office said

151
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,400
that the White House lost time
because that office was disbanded.

152
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,920
What do you make of that ?

153
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,480
I think it's a nasty question.
When you say "me," I didn't do it.

154
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,600
We have a group of people...
I could ask, perhaps...

155
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,480
I could perhaps
ask Tony about that,

156
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,760
because I don't know
anything about it.

157
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,640
You say we did that...

158
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,640
You don't know about the reorganization
at the National Security Council ?

159
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,360
It's the administration.
Perhaps they do that !

160
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,320
People let people go. You used to be
with a different newspaper than now.

161
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,480
Okay, please, go ahead.
We're doing a great job.

162
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,400
Perfect. "I didn't do it.
I don't know anything about it."

163
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,400
"Maybe someone in the administration
did it. Maybe Tony did it."

164
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,440
"These things happen. I don't know,"
again, "We're doing a great job."

165
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,280
That is reminiscent of Truman's
famous saying:

166
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,040
"The buck stops...
somewhere over there, maybe ?"

167
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,760
Tony ?
Tony, you stop that buck ?

168
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,280
Tony probably stopped it.
I don't know, lady, I just work here.

169
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,520
That is a level
of dodging responsibility

170
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,840
that Trump has been perfecting ever
since he was very much not in Vietnam.

171
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,440
It feels important to point out
that one of the marquee announcements

172
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,280
was the president's claim
that Google was building a website

173
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,600
that would direct people
to drive-through testing facilities,

174
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,680
which sounds fantastic.

175
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,640
But, you should know,
Google quickly clarified

176
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,560
the site "is in the early stages
of development"

177
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,480
with plans to roll out
testing in the Bay Area,

178
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,560
and maybe expand it
more broadly over time.

179
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,600
So, in terms of immediate help,
that website is about as effective

180
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,120
as going to IsThisACat-dot-com.

181
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,400
If you're not familiar
with this website,

182
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,600
you can simply upload a photo
and it will tell you with a yes or no

183
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,320
if the thing you're looking at
is a cat or not.

184
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,760
See that ?
The website knows it's a cat.

185
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,080
When I uploaded a picture of a dog,
the website says "no."

186
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,640
That's how you know
it's a good website.

187
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,240
Will it tell where the drive-through
testing locations are ?

188
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,360
No, it won't.
But for the time being,

189
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,360
neither will Trump's Google thing,
so you might as well spend your time

190
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,040
looking at things
that are and are not cats.

191
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,600
This is clearly both frustrating
and extremely unnerving.

192
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,920
And it is contributing to a sense of
confusion in the country at the moment.

193
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,120
At this point,

194
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,360
it might really be best for us
to put the president aside.

195
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,160
There is going to be ample time
to be utterly furious with him later.

196
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,960
But the fact is, even though
this should not be the case,

197
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,880
it seems we're gonna be
a little bit on our own here.

198
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,840
And because of that, it might be
worth going over some basic rules

199
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,560
that health experts say
we should all absolutely be following

200
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,360
to help stem this outbreak.

201
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,600
Individuals have been doing their
best to spread good information online,

202
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,760
including a number of social-media
celebrities on TikTok,

203
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,280
none more delightful
than this one.

204
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,560
I mean that is excellent.

205
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,080
That TikTok hamster is now
my favorite thing in the world.

206
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,840
I fully understand
I have a wife and two children.

207
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,200
I'll say it again: that TikTok hamster
is my favorite thing in the world.

208
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,040
And it is truly sad that a hamster
just genuinely offered

209
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,680
more useful public-health advice
in one 12-second TikTok

210
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,200
than the president has in multiple
addresses to the nation.

211
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,240
Let's go over what that very wise ball
of fluff was just telling us.

212
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,600
First: wash your hands
for at least 20 seconds.

213
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,560
That's really good advice.
It's basically the time it takes

214
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,920
to sing "Happy Birthday"
to Oprah twice.

215
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,040
So, it's time well-spent.
Second...

216
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,920
Make sure you cough and sneeze
into a tissue, your elbow

217
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,680
or your upper sleeve,
not your hand.

218
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,040
And disinfect frequently
touched surfaces daily.

219
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:51,320
Third: wear masks only if you have
symptoms or you are a caregiver,

220
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,840
as it is important that there are
enough of these masks available

221
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,680
for medical professionals and
those with respiratory conditions.

222
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,400
And, finally, stay home,

223
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,120
especially if you're sick,
but also if you are not.

224
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,200
That last one is part
of what's called "social distancing",

225
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,360
or, as President Trump put it
on Twitter with all caps

226
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,160
and no further explanation:

227
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,800
"SOCIAL DISTANCING !"
Exclamation mark !

228
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,400
He makes a fine point,

229
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,080
but if I may just expand
on that scream-tweet a little,

230
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,720
social distancing
is absolutely crucial right now.

231
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,080
The idea is to avoid crowded places,
cancel social engagements,

232
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,080
avoid unnecessary travel,

233
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,920
work from home
if that is an option for you,

234
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,040
and if you need to buy groceries
or use public transit,

235
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,720
try to do it at off-peak times.

236
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,360
Now, obviously, that is not
all feasible for everyone,

237
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,600
but if you truly
have no choice but to go out,

238
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,320
it is vital to protect yourself
and others

239
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,320
by keeping a distance of at least
six feet from other people.

240
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,480
Basically, for the time being,
pretend you're a British parent

241
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,200
and everyone else
in the world is your child.

242
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,200
Keep as much distance as you can,
avoid physical contact at all costs

243
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,240
and if any one of them try
to give you a hug, reject it.

244
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,560
The reason why social distancing
is so important

245
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,480
is because it can help us
"flatten the curve".

246
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
It's a phrase you've probably
heard a lot this week.

247
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,400
What it means is this:
slow the spread of the virus

248
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,120
so we don't overwhelm
the healthcare system.

249
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,720
We only have so many ventilators
and hospital beds.

250
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,560
And if cases spike all at once,
they could max out our capacity.

251
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,520
I know that there is a temptation
to think: "Hold on, this is America."

252
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,680
"I'm sure we have enough ventilators
for even the worst-case scenario".

253
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,840
We don't. We really don't.

254
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,600
So, it is imperative
that we spread cases out

255
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,640
over a longer period of time

256
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,840
so that everyone
who needs care can get it.

257
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,120
Proper social distancing
involves some sacrifice,

258
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,600
but this is a critical thing

259
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,120
that we should all do for
the more vulnerable among us

260
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,640
and for healthcare workers
who are going to be in the shit

261
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,160
for some time to come.

262
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,640
For an example of what it looks like
when you do not flatten the curve,

263
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,000
look to the hardest hit
areas of Italy,

264
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,520
where cases have
so overwhelmed the system,

265
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,200
doctors have had to make
very difficult choices

266
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,240
about who gets potentially life-saving
treatment and who doesn't.

267
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,480
In addition to attempting to quell
the spread of the virus,

268
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,120
we should also be doing
everything that we can

269
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,400
to contain the spread
of misinformation

270
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,160
because there is a lot of harmful
bullshit flying around.

271
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,560
There's Alex Jones, who
suggested that his toothpaste

272
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,400
"kills the whole SARS-corona
family at point-blank range".

273
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,800
And it would be great
if it did that !

274
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:01,080
I would love it if his toothpaste
did that. But y'know... it doesn't.

275
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,440
There's multiple commentators who've
made comparisons to the swine flu,

276
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,160
an illness with a mortality rate
at least 50 times lower than this one.

277
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,400
Then there is Geraldo Rivera,

278
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,680
who felt it important
to tell Fox viewers this.

279
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,840
If you've got a fever or if you can't
hold your breath for 10 seconds.

280
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,600
Everyone should do that.
Hold your breath for 10 seconds.

281
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,120
If you can hold your breath
for 10 seconds, then you're...

282
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,280
You don't have this disease.

283
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,960
I am guessing you instinctively
know this, but:

284
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,800
that's just not true
in any way whatsoever.

285
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,400
You can't test for the coronavirus
by holding your breath.

286
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,760
I do have a way that Geraldo
can test for the coronavirus,

287
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,280
but this will only work for Geraldo
and absolutely no one else.

288
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,960
Are you listening, Geraldo ?
Okay, hold your breath, like this.

289
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,880
Right ? You doing it ?
Now, keep holding it.

290
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,240
Keep holding it, Geraldo.
Keep holding that breath, Geraldo.

291
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,120
I know you might be feeling dizzy,
about to pass out,

292
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,960
but don't worry, G-Man, that
means the test is working.

293
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,840
Keep holding your breath.
Do not breathe, Geraldo.

294
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,240
Don't you breathe right now.
Your lungs are probably burning,

295
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,640
that means you're
disinfecting them, well done.

296
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,120
Keep holding your breath.
I will tell you when to let it out.

297
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,080
I'm not gonna tell him
to let it out.

298
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,600
The point is, I know that that
may seem obviously dumb,

299
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:31,240
but there is a ton of misinformation,
and not all is so obviously bullshit.

300
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,600
Please be careful before forwarding
or retweeting stuff

301
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,640
that you do not know to be true.

302
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,280
Our personal actions
are going to count here.

303
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,040
Even if you are not worried about
getting this virus, other people,

304
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,480
especially the elderly
and the immunosuppressed,

305
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,640
simply don't have that luxury.

306
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,080
So, it is a good idea
to treat these precautions

307
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,760
like you would a flu shot.

308
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,000
You don't just get a flu shot for you,
you get it for everybody else.

309
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,480
We all have a real responsibility
to one another right now,

310
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,480
the choices we make
in the coming days and weeks

311
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,480
will contribute directly
to how bad this crisis gets.

312
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,880
I know that this disruption
to your life is annoying.

313
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,640
It's okay to be disappointed
or even irritated,

314
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,920
'cause you can't go out or your
favorite events were postponed,

315
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,880
or a trip you had
planned fell through.

316
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,400
But you've got to get that
out of your system.

317
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,440
Let's put 30 seconds
on the clock right now,

318
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,120
during which everyone
can be selfishly angry

319
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,920
about the things that they didn't
want canceled or postponed,

320
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,400
whether it's the NBA
suspending its season,

321
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,160
or Disney World being closed,

322
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,360
or the ninth "Fast & Furious" movie
being pushed back a year.

323
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,760
It's the one John Cena
was gonna be in !

324
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,240
That stings,
I'm not gonna say it doesn't.

325
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,960
I'm gonna be spending
the next 30 seconds being furious

326
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,240
about the fact that my favorite
football team, Liverpool,

327
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,480
were two games away from
winning the League championship

328
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,840
before games were suspended,
so, let's start the clock, now.

329
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,800
I've waited
my entire adult life for this.

330
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,800
They were about to win the title
for the first time in 30 years.

331
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,120
They were 25 points
ahead of Man City, 25 points !

332
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,040
A historic margin. And you're
telling me it could be for nothing ?

333
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,840
Mo Salah deserves to be
a Premier League champion.

334
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,880
The coach,
Jürgen Klopp, deserves this !

335
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,560
He has specifically pointed out,

336
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,520
that we should
not worry about the League now,

337
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,680
we should keep things
in perspective,

338
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,520
but that makes me want him
to win the title even more.

339
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,200
I want to see the trophy going
through the Shankly Gates.

340
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,480
That doesn't make me
a bad person ? Okay ?

341
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,520
That's it. We're out of time.
It's out of my system now.

342
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,280
It just feels like they should
give Liverpool the League title,

343
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,240
'cause they've basically won it.

344
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,120
Okay. I'm done.

345
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,480
It's not like anyone's gonna catch up
from the 25-point deficit anyway.

346
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,800
Okay, you're right.
Sports are not important right now.

347
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,600
I mean, they're not really
important ever,

348
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,040
but they're especially
not important now.

349
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,640
I know things
are currently very scary.

350
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,920
And things
are gonna be weird for a while,

351
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,400
for weeks, and honestly,
more likely, months.

352
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,800
And the fact that that is true
makes it even more important

353
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,600
that, going forward, we're gonna
need to look out for one another

354
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,480
and not just in terms of containing
the transmission of this virus,

355
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,760
but also in terms of the economic
impact that this is going to have

356
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,920
on people who may well
not be able to weather it.

357
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,960
This is going to be an unsettling
and potentially lonely time.

358
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,200
So, think about calling older
relatives or neighbors,

359
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,600
or just anyone that you know
who may be vulnerable,

360
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,480
or feeling isolated.

361
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,720
One small way you can help

362
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,080
is by donating financially
to your local food bank.

363
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,760
There is a directory of those
at FeedingAmerica-dot-org.

364
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,480
Just to reiterate: try your best,
I know it's hard,

365
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,520
but try your best to tune out
and not pass on misinformation

366
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,280
from sources like,
sadly, the president.

367
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,640
And instead, pay more attention
to trustworthy information

368
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,360
from the CDC,
experts like Anthony Fauci,

369
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,840
and of course,
TikTok hamsters.

370
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,720
Always TikTok hamsters.

371
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,120
Take care of yourself.
Take care of each other.

372
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,800
And we will be back in some form,
sometime in the future.

373
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,560
And until then,
stay safe and goodnight !

374
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,800
We're clear.

375
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,600
Okaaaay. Fuuuck.

376
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,080
