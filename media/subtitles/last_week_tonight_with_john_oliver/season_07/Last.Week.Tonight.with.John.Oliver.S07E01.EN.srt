1
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:37,856
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

2
00:00:38,016 --> 00:00:40,536
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

3
00:00:40,696 --> 00:00:45,056
We are back,
and there is simply no time to recap

4
00:00:45,216 --> 00:00:46,896
everything that has happened
since we've been away.

5
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:49,656
But in short, we nearly
went to war with Iran,

6
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:52,136
the UK's election made
BoJo prime minister,

7
00:00:52,296 --> 00:00:54,656
and the coronavirus has started
spreading around the world.

8
00:00:54,816 --> 00:00:56,416
And if you happen to feel like
you're getting sick right now,

9
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,336
you do have it,
and you only have hours to live.

10
00:00:59,496 --> 00:01:01,856
Also, Harry and Meghan
left the royal family,

11
00:01:02,016 --> 00:01:04,536
Baby Yoda showed the world what
it was like when Yoda was a baby,

12
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:08,136
Bong Joon Ho won all the Oscars,
Bernie Sanders won New Hampshire,

13
00:01:08,296 --> 00:01:10,416
and this poodle named Siba
won Best in Show

14
00:01:10,576 --> 00:01:14,615
at the Westminster Dog Show, making
her, I believe, 100% that bitch.

15
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:18,935
But obviously...
Obviously, we have to get

16
00:01:19,095 --> 00:01:21,015
to the biggest story of the break.

17
00:01:21,175 --> 00:01:23,735
What happens when
an obvious criminal sociopath

18
00:01:23,895 --> 00:01:27,535
is accused of abusing his power,
yet somehow holds on to his office

19
00:01:27,695 --> 00:01:30,375
by sailing through
a sham investigation?

20
00:01:30,535 --> 00:01:35,375
Gritty, the Philadelphia Flyers' mascot,
is now cleared of wrongdoing.

21
00:01:35,535 --> 00:01:39,295
A man claimed that Gritty punched
his 13-year-old son in

22
00:01:39,455 --> 00:01:41,495
the back during a holiday
photo shoot in November.

23
00:01:41,655 --> 00:01:46,175
After an investigation,
Philadelphia police cleared Gritty.

24
00:01:46,335 --> 00:01:48,935
I'm sure that Gritty just
kind of rolled his eyes

25
00:01:49,095 --> 00:01:51,215
because that's what they...
they're googly.

26
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,535
Wait, hold on there.
Hold it. For a start,

27
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:55,495
I'm not sure
that "googly" is the best way

28
00:01:55,655 --> 00:01:59,615
to describe Gritty's eyes at all.
"Deeply psychotic"? Sure.

29
00:01:59,775 --> 00:02:02,935
"Two swirling vortexes
of horniness and rage"? Better.

30
00:02:03,095 --> 00:02:05,175
"A pair of haunted nipples
"floating on a plate of milk

31
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:07,615
and surrounded by a nest
of orangutan pubes?"

32
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:11,695
Now we're getting somewhere. Now
we're describing this monster's eyes.

33
00:02:11,855 --> 00:02:15,175
But clearly, Gritty is not
the only aggro neon weirdo

34
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,935
celebrating his acquittal
these days.

35
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:20,775
The president beat
his impeachment charges...

36
00:02:20,935 --> 00:02:24,335
Although some Republicans
who voted to acquit him claim

37
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:27,134
that the whole experience
may well have changed him.

38
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:31,774
I believe that the president
has learned from this case.

39
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:36,694
The president has been impeached.
That's a pretty big lesson.

40
00:02:36,854 --> 00:02:41,894
I believe that he will be much
more cautious in the future.

41
00:02:42,054 --> 00:02:45,014
What are you talking about, Susan?

42
00:02:45,174 --> 00:02:49,174
Of course he hasn't learned his lesson.
Trump never learns his lesson.

43
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:50,894
This is the man
whose firstborn child

44
00:02:51,054 --> 00:02:54,214
was Donald Trump Jr.,
and he kept having children.

45
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,894
There's no lesson-learning
capacity in the man.

46
00:02:58,054 --> 00:03:01,214
And if you need further proof of that,
just look what happened this week

47
00:03:01,374 --> 00:03:04,694
with Trump associate Roger Stone,
convicted last year on seven counts

48
00:03:04,854 --> 00:03:06,774
of lying to congress,
witness tampering,

49
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:09,734
and obstructing a proceeding.
On Monday, prosecutors recommended

50
00:03:09,894 --> 00:03:12,174
a sentence of seven
to nine years in prison.

51
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:16,614
-And that is when things got weird.
-Tonight, at least four prosecutors

52
00:03:16,774 --> 00:03:19,214
stepping down from
the Roger Stone case

53
00:03:19,374 --> 00:03:22,054
after a dramatic decision
to overrule their recommendation

54
00:03:22,214 --> 00:03:24,974
that he spend seven
to nine years in prison.

55
00:03:25,134 --> 00:03:27,694
The stunning rebuke from the
Justice Department leadership

56
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:30,654
came just hours after
President Trump tweeted that

57
00:03:30,814 --> 00:03:34,214
the prosecutors' suggested
sentence for Stone was, quote,

58
00:03:34,374 --> 00:03:37,774
"horrible and very unfair.
A miscarriage of justice."

59
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:40,933
Yeah, but was it a
miscarriage of justice, though?

60
00:03:41,093 --> 00:03:43,973
'Cause bear in mind, Stone was
found guilty on all counts;

61
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:47,053
the recommendation was within
established federal guidelines;

62
00:03:47,213 --> 00:03:50,773
and also, just look at him.

63
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:53,653
I know you shouldn't profile
people based on how they look,

64
00:03:53,813 --> 00:03:59,933
but on the other hand,
look...at...him! Look at him!

65
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:02,653
His dress code
is "business scoundrel."

66
00:04:02,813 --> 00:04:05,893
He looks like the mannequin
at a department store

67
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:10,173
for Dick Tracy villains. He looks like
a guy whose day planner just says,

68
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,333
"Frame Roger Rabbit."
Look at him!

69
00:04:13,493 --> 00:04:16,213
And even if you think
the recommended sentence was,

70
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:19,693
in fact, too long, it's up to
the judge whether to impose it,

71
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:22,373
and there's an appeal system
after that.

72
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:26,813
But to have DOJ leadership interfering
in a case involving a Trump ally

73
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:29,813
hours after the president
directly commented on it

74
00:04:29,973 --> 00:04:31,853
is appalling.
This is America.

75
00:04:32,013 --> 00:04:33,813
Your experience with
the criminal justice system

76
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,653
should not depend on how much
the president likes you.

77
00:04:36,813 --> 00:04:38,533
It should depend on
how much money you have,

78
00:04:38,693 --> 00:04:40,093
what color your skin is,

79
00:04:40,253 --> 00:04:42,133
and whether or not the judge
has already had lunch.

80
00:04:42,293 --> 00:04:48,333
That is how we do things here
in the United States, buddy.

81
00:04:48,493 --> 00:04:51,893
And the excuses offered
by the president's defenders

82
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:55,732
ranged from the absurd
to the genuinely terrifying.

83
00:04:55,892 --> 00:04:58,172
The executive power is vested
in the president.

84
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:00,772
The top law enforcement officer is
the attorney general.

85
00:05:00,932 --> 00:05:03,892
If he wants to counteract decisions
of the line prosecutor,

86
00:05:04,052 --> 00:05:06,572
that's his dang job.
I mean, there's nothing wrong with this.

87
00:05:06,732 --> 00:05:08,972
I like the fact that a president
of the United States,

88
00:05:09,132 --> 00:05:11,932
when he sees injustice,
he's pointing it out.

89
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:14,612
That's exactly what you want
to have a president do.

90
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:18,772
I don't want to hear any crap
about an independent justice department.

91
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:21,932
This justice department,
as does everyone,

92
00:05:22,092 --> 00:05:25,212
works for the president.
It is part of the executive branch.

93
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:28,892
Oh, he's right. Of course.
Everyone at the justice department

94
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:32,652
works for the president. When he says,
"Jump," they should say, "How high?"

95
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:35,532
When he says, "Lock her up,"
they should say, "How long?"

96
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:38,772
When he says, "Get me Flubber,"
they should say, "From the movie?"

97
00:05:38,932 --> 00:05:42,172
When he says, "Yes,"
they should say, "Okay."

98
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:44,252
When he says,
"Where's that Flubber I asked for?"

99
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:47,732
They should say, "We're working on it."
When he says, "I need it now,"

100
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:51,932
they should say, "Okay, here it is."
When he says, "Is this lettuce?"

101
00:05:52,092 --> 00:05:54,132
They should say,
"No. That's Flubber."

102
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:55,732
When he says, "It's not dancing,"

103
00:05:55,892 --> 00:05:57,932
they should say,
"It's probably just tired."

104
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:00,212
When he says,
"Go away so my Flubber can sleep,"

105
00:06:00,372 --> 00:06:02,292
they should say,
"It would be an honor."

106
00:06:02,452 --> 00:06:04,452
And then everyone
in the justice department

107
00:06:04,612 --> 00:06:06,892
should line up and kiss the
president's Flubber good night

108
00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:09,851
because, damn it, they're part
of the executive branch.

109
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:16,251
They work for him!
This whole situation looked so bad

110
00:06:16,411 --> 00:06:18,251
that Barr gave an interview
in which he claimed

111
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,171
he never discussed
Stone's sentence with Trump,

112
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:23,091
but added that it was time for
the president to stop tweeting

113
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:25,851
about Department of Justice
criminal cases. You know,

114
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,811
good luck with that.

115
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,971
And while this was
widely portrayed by the media

116
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:33,411
as a rift between Trump and his AG,
I have a sickening feeling

117
00:06:33,571 --> 00:06:35,851
that Laura Ingraham
was one of the few people

118
00:06:36,011 --> 00:06:38,691
-actually seeing things clearly.
-All right, John,

119
00:06:38,851 --> 00:06:41,931
the media sees this sexy story
of Trump versus Barr,

120
00:06:42,091 --> 00:06:45,331
but they miss the fact
that Barr was basically telling Trump,

121
00:06:45,491 --> 00:06:46,811
"Don't worry, I got this."

122
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:49,571
To borrow a phrase
used almost exclusively

123
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:53,211
by white supremacists,
"Laura Ingraham is right."

124
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,611
Barr's comments weren't so much,

125
00:06:56,771 --> 00:06:58,691
"Don't interfere
with the justice department,"

126
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:02,411
as they were, "Don't publicly interfere
"with the justice department

127
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:04,651
because I'm already doing
what you want."

128
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:06,171
In fact, on Friday, news broke

129
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:08,491
that Barr was reviewing
the DOJ's prosecution

130
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:11,931
of another Trump ally, Michael Flynn,
all of which suggests

131
00:07:12,091 --> 00:07:14,171
that Susan Collins
may actually have been right

132
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:18,451
about one thing: Trump did learn
a lesson from his impeachment trial.

133
00:07:18,611 --> 00:07:21,091
Specifically, "I can get away
with anything

134
00:07:21,251 --> 00:07:23,331
because no one
will hold me accountable."

135
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:26,930
And unlike the child who was
definitely punched in the back

136
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,850
by a googly-eyed fur demon,

137
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:32,170
we cannot say that
we didn't see this coming.

138
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,970
And now this.

139
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:39,410
And now, another installment of
"Coming up on 'The Doctors.'"

140
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:43,530
The seniors that are taking "50
Shades of Gray" to a whole new level.

141
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,410
-Plus...
-You called 911 for that?

142
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,290
-I want my weed back.
-Then...

143
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,890
Is it possible to overdose
on gummy vitamins?

144
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,570
-Then...
-Burglar didn't demand cash.

145
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,530
-Just wanted to suck his toes.
-Plus...

146
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,890
It's time to spin the Wheel of Pee.

147
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,770
-And...
-Spin the Wheel of Poop.

148
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,410
-Then...
-The Wheel of...

149
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,490
And Dr. Abs is on duty,
and he's got the secret

150
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,850
-to banishing your back pain for good.
-Then...

151
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,450
"I've been suffering from
severe butt cheek cramps."

152
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,570
Plus, wanna make some quick cash?

153
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,250
Maybe you should sell your poop.

154
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,090
-This could be a career.
-Then...

155
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,210
-This is crazy.
-Why people are putting

156
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,890
anti-anxiety pills down...there?
And why women are putting

157
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,450
their vacuum down... where?

158
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,330
-No!
-O-M-G.

159
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,290
Plus, it's time
for another installment of...

160
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,370
Don't put that down there.

161
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,850
That's today.

162
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,250
Moving on.
For our main story tonight,

163
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:41,529
we thought we'd talk about an issue that
has dominated the Democratic primary.

164
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:44,889
And I'm not talking about why
Tom Steyer doesn't look richer.

165
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:46,609
But why doesn't he, though?

166
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:48,889
His skin's sallow,
his clothes don't fit right,

167
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:50,849
and he seems to only have one tie.

168
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:53,809
What is this man doing
with all his fucking money?

169
00:08:53,969 --> 00:08:55,689
No, we're not talking about that.

170
00:08:55,849 --> 00:08:57,929
Instead, we're gonna talk about this.

171
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:00,929
It's the hot buzz phrase
for Democrats running for president:

172
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:04,449
-"Medicare for All."
-We will have Medicare for All.

173
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:07,769
We have a chance
for Medicare for All.

174
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:09,769
-Medicare for All?
-Medicare for All.

175
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:13,049
Now, there's a lot of talk
about Medicare for All.

176
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:16,689
-What does that mean?
-Great question

177
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:19,289
from a great judge
and an even greater human being.

178
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:21,089
And to answer the question

179
00:09:21,249 --> 00:09:23,929
from Ruth Bader Ginsburg's
inevitable successor,

180
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:25,489
"What is Medicare for All?"

181
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:29,129
Well, right now, we have what's
called a multi-payer system.

182
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:32,729
What that means is maybe your health
care is covered by private insurance

183
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:34,449
purchased by you or your employer.

184
00:09:34,609 --> 00:09:36,729
Or maybe it's covered
by a government program

185
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:38,289
like Medicare or Medicaid.

186
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:41,009
Or maybe you're one
of the 27 million Americans

187
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:43,809
with no insurance, in which case,
you're fucked.

188
00:09:43,969 --> 00:09:48,529
The basic idea behind Medicare for All
is that all of this will be replaced

189
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:51,649
by a government-funded,
single-payer program.

190
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:54,328
And the goal of universal
health care coverage

191
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:55,808
is extremely appealing.

192
00:09:55,968 --> 00:09:57,768
Both Bernie Sanders
and Elizabeth Warren

193
00:09:57,928 --> 00:09:59,408
have put out versions
of Medicare for All.

194
00:09:59,568 --> 00:10:01,848
But other Democrats
have been much warier of it,

195
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:05,488
and conservatives
absolutely hate the idea.

196
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,688
We cannot afford Medicare for All.

197
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:10,768
This is the end of America
as we know it economically.

198
00:10:10,928 --> 00:10:14,328
I think literally 90% of hospitals
would go under tomorrow.

199
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,608
Right. Medicare for All?
I lived in England, Sean.

200
00:10:17,768 --> 00:10:22,928
Nationalized health care is a disaster.
When rich, famous people get sick,

201
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:25,648
they don't fly to Canada.
They don't fly to Cuba.

202
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:29,208
The come here because we have
the best medicine in the world.

203
00:10:29,368 --> 00:10:31,248
Look, look. I will give that man this.

204
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:33,728
America does have one
of the best health care systems

205
00:10:33,888 --> 00:10:36,648
in the world for rich, famous people.

206
00:10:36,808 --> 00:10:39,128
Unfortunately, too many people
are born in this country

207
00:10:39,288 --> 00:10:43,888
with a terrible preexisting condition
called "not being Beyoncé."

208
00:10:44,048 --> 00:10:47,528
Some of us...
many of us, in fact... are Solange.

209
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:52,968
And for so many Americans,
our system is badly broken.

210
00:10:53,128 --> 00:10:56,288
And I'm not just talking about the
27 million without health insurance,

211
00:10:56,448 --> 00:11:00,248
but the nearly 44 million more
who are underinsured:

212
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:02,448
people with high deductibles
and co-pays

213
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:04,368
that can end up bleeding them dry.

214
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:07,088
The majority of people
who file for bankruptcy

215
00:11:07,248 --> 00:11:08,887
cite medical expenses as a factor.

216
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:10,767
And you probably
already knew that deep down

217
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:14,047
from just how often you see
GoFundMe campaigns online

218
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,007
from worried parents
of sick children

219
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:18,687
or your friend who got
a pineapple stuck up his ass

220
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:23,327
and needs help paying the doctors
to stop laughing and get it out.

221
00:11:23,487 --> 00:11:25,847
And incidentally, for all
the heartwarming success stories

222
00:11:26,007 --> 00:11:29,767
that you see, a study found 90%
of crowdfunding campaigns

223
00:11:29,927 --> 00:11:32,607
for medical expenses
fail to meet their goal.

224
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:35,007
And when they fall short,
it can be crushing.

225
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:38,367
Watch as one family struggles
to raise $10,000 for expenses

226
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:41,607
arising from their two-year-old
daughter's eye disorder.

227
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:45,087
Chayla's fundraiser isn't
going as well as they'd hoped.

228
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:49,047
About a month in,
it's only raised $610.

229
00:11:49,207 --> 00:11:51,327
Early morning on the day
of Chayla's surgery,

230
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:54,687
her parents are still trying
to get the word out.

231
00:11:54,847 --> 00:12:00,727
Okay, so we're gonna make her sign.
#EyesforChayla.

232
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,607
Very good.

233
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:05,087
Think about what
you're looking at there.

234
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,887
It's a pretty dystopian society
that we're living in

235
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:09,687
if your physical
and financial well-being

236
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:11,887
depend on whether
your crowdfunding campaign

237
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:15,447
can get a signal boost
from Jiffpom the Pomeranian.

238
00:12:15,607 --> 00:12:18,007
And good luck with that, by the way.
I've been trying to get him to post

239
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:20,647
our gerrymandering piece for months now,
and he won't do it.

240
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:25,326
Come on, Jiffpom!
Throw us a fucking bone, you asshole!

241
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:31,246
The point is, any solution
that might put an end to that

242
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:33,366
is worth at least
considering, surely.

243
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:36,886
And to be honest, I personally
think there is a lot to be said

244
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:39,726
for Medicare for All.
So tonight, let's take a look at it...

245
00:12:39,886 --> 00:12:44,046
not the politics of whether
it can pass, but what it actually is.

246
00:12:44,206 --> 00:12:45,566
And whenever the subject comes up,

247
00:12:45,726 --> 00:12:48,126
we tend
to hear three major criticisms of it

248
00:12:48,286 --> 00:12:52,286
concerning cost, wait times, and choice.
And let's start with cost,

249
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:54,486
because critics will tell you
that Medicare for All

250
00:12:54,646 --> 00:12:58,006
will simply increase
the federal budget too much.

251
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:03,406
This sicko socialism
would cost roughly $32.6 trillion

252
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:04,926
over ten years.

253
00:13:05,086 --> 00:13:09,526
Even if you doubled tax collections
from individuals and corporations...

254
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:12,686
yes, that means you'd be paying twice
what you already do in taxes...

255
00:13:12,846 --> 00:13:14,966
that still doesn't cover the tab.

256
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:17,686
My God, free health care
is expensive.

257
00:13:18,086 --> 00:13:21,006
Look, I know that sounds dramatic,

258
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,886
but Sarah Palin's fourth
attempt at cloning herself

259
00:13:24,046 --> 00:13:26,926
actually has a point there.

260
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:30,886
Medicare for All would,
undeniably, be expensive.

261
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:34,566
But that fact needs
a lot of context around it.

262
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:38,325
For starters, well, it would increase
the federal budget, yes,

263
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:42,165
but it would also eliminate
employer spending on premiums

264
00:13:42,325 --> 00:13:44,525
and your spending
on out-of-pocket costs.

265
00:13:44,685 --> 00:13:47,565
Now would those balance each other out?
That is a good question.

266
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:50,445
The answer is no one can
possibly know for sure.

267
00:13:50,605 --> 00:13:52,925
There are just too many
variables involved.

268
00:13:53,085 --> 00:13:55,885
"The Times" asked five
prominent experts to estimate

269
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:58,085
national health care spending
under Bernie's plan,

270
00:13:58,245 --> 00:14:00,085
and they compared that
to what we spend now.

271
00:14:00,245 --> 00:14:02,845
And the results ranged from
"it would actually cost us less"

272
00:14:03,005 --> 00:14:04,845
to "it would cost about the same"

273
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:07,445
to "it would cost
a fuck of a lot more."

274
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:10,045
And I know that extra shading
does not look like very much,

275
00:14:10,205 --> 00:14:14,605
but believe me, it's a fuck of a lot.
But look.

276
00:14:14,765 --> 00:14:18,325
Let's say, just for argument's sake,
our overall spending did go up.

277
00:14:18,485 --> 00:14:20,965
We would be getting
a lot for that money.

278
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:24,605
Remember, 27 million
more people would be covered,

279
00:14:24,765 --> 00:14:28,045
and they'd be covered well.
Bernie's plan is incredibly generous.

280
00:14:28,205 --> 00:14:31,805
It covers vision, dental,
long-term care, and drugs.

281
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:34,405
In fact, "Medicare for All"
is a misleading title

282
00:14:34,565 --> 00:14:38,525
because Medicare requires some co-pays
and out-of-pocket expenses.

283
00:14:38,685 --> 00:14:42,685
And Bernie will excitedly tell you
his plan eliminates those.

284
00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:46,485
Under the Medicare for All
bill that I wrote,

285
00:14:46,645 --> 00:14:51,045
premiums are gone,
co-payments are gone,

286
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:56,564
deductibles are gone,
all out-of-pocket expenses are gone.

287
00:14:56,724 --> 00:15:00,124
He's right. Hospital bills are gone.
Co-payments are gone.

288
00:15:00,284 --> 00:15:03,564
Cell phone payments, gone.
Flat tires, gone.

289
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:05,284
Geico commercials, gone.

290
00:15:05,444 --> 00:15:08,324
All the things you hate
in this world will be gone,

291
00:15:08,484 --> 00:15:12,604
and all that will remain
is universally accessible health care

292
00:15:12,764 --> 00:15:17,764
and Laura Dern.
Finally, life as it should be.

293
00:15:17,924 --> 00:15:19,684
Bernie's plan isn't
just more generous

294
00:15:19,844 --> 00:15:21,684
than most current
private insurance plans.

295
00:15:21,844 --> 00:15:26,164
It's more generous than the policy
of any single-payer country on Earth.

296
00:15:26,324 --> 00:15:28,204
And there is a good case
to be made that

297
00:15:28,364 --> 00:15:31,044
even if national spending
wound up higher,

298
00:15:31,204 --> 00:15:33,044
we might wind up wasting less.

299
00:15:33,204 --> 00:15:35,804
Right now, a lot
of our health care spending

300
00:15:35,964 --> 00:15:38,364
doesn't go to health care.
It goes to administrative costs

301
00:15:38,524 --> 00:15:40,844
that come with having
a vast insurance industry.

302
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:43,644
That is clearly wildly inefficient.

303
00:15:43,804 --> 00:15:46,764
And consolidating all
health insurance under one roof

304
00:15:46,924 --> 00:15:48,964
would give the government
far more leverage

305
00:15:49,124 --> 00:15:52,004
to negotiate prices down,
because, look, it is no secret

306
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:56,524
prices for procedures and drugs
are out of control in the United States.

307
00:15:56,684 --> 00:15:59,724
It is so bad,
one insurance provider in Utah

308
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:02,964
recently started offering
some of its participants cash

309
00:16:03,124 --> 00:16:05,364
if they were willing
to travel a little further

310
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:08,803
than their local pharmacy
to fill out their prescription.

311
00:16:08,963 --> 00:16:12,923
It's called "pharmaceutical tourism."
Here's how it works.

312
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:16,003
PEHP puts patients on a plane
and flies them to San Diego.

313
00:16:16,163 --> 00:16:18,883
From there, a private car
takes them across the border

314
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:20,443
to Tijuana, Mexico,

315
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:23,923
where their prescription is waiting
for them. The only difference?

316
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,683
The prescription costs
roughly half the price.

317
00:16:26,843 --> 00:16:31,523
PEHP will give people willing to travel
an additional $500 back.

318
00:16:31,683 --> 00:16:35,003
It's cheaper for us to pay
for the drug down there,

319
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:38,203
send them down there,
and then give them $500.

320
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:44,923
That's fucking crazy! Giving you $500
to go to Mexico to buy drugs

321
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,923
is not what your insurance
provider should be doing.

322
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,643
It's what your sketchy friend
Meredith should be doing

323
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:56,563
because she wants to make Brianna's
bachelorette party a total rager.

324
00:16:56,723 --> 00:17:01,923
"I'd go myself,
but I have outstanding warrants."

325
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,723
Under Medicare for All,

326
00:17:03,883 --> 00:17:06,523
the government would be
a much stronger negotiator.

327
00:17:06,683 --> 00:17:08,723
Now, you wouldn't want it
to set prices so low

328
00:17:08,883 --> 00:17:11,243
that it stifles innovation
or bankrupts doctors,

329
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:13,163
but that is a balance that
you would need to strike.

330
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:17,523
Overall, you can't definitely say
that it would be more expensive.

331
00:17:17,683 --> 00:17:21,203
But even if it was, I personally would
argue that it's worth it.

332
00:17:21,363 --> 00:17:24,802
And either way, cost is a lot
more complicated an issue

333
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:29,722
than just going on TV and saying,
"$32.6 ta-rillion"

334
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:34,402
like Tina Fey doing
her best Dr. Evil impression.

335
00:17:34,562 --> 00:17:37,482
Anyway, the next major
criticism of Medicare for All

336
00:17:37,642 --> 00:17:40,922
concerns wait times, specifically,
that it would result in rationing

337
00:17:41,082 --> 00:17:43,042
-and delays to care.
-If you think it's fun

338
00:17:43,202 --> 00:17:46,162
to wait in line at DMV, you're gonna
love Bernie Sanders' wait times

339
00:17:46,322 --> 00:17:49,002
for Medicare for All.
-It leads to the kind of care

340
00:17:49,162 --> 00:17:52,322
that people now have in England or
Canada, where you have to wait in line.

341
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:56,322
Just take a look at Canada or the UK.
It means long waiting lines.

342
00:17:56,482 --> 00:17:59,682
it means people not getting
the health treatments they need.

343
00:17:59,842 --> 00:18:03,882
Okay, I get that no one likes
waiting in line for anything. I get it.

344
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:08,122
Most people see the line at Trader Joe's
and either abandon their cart

345
00:18:08,282 --> 00:18:10,722
or pull the fire alarm
and sneak out with their groceries,

346
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:13,002
undetected.
I'm not saying I've ever done that.

347
00:18:13,162 --> 00:18:16,122
I'm just saying I had
a show to do tonight

348
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:22,042
and who wants some
peanut butter pretzels?

349
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:27,522
But look. As with cost, comparisons
of wait times are very complicated.

350
00:18:27,682 --> 00:18:30,922
For one thing, the international wait
times that you hear about most often

351
00:18:31,082 --> 00:18:34,722
are for non-emergency surgeries,
such as knee replacements.

352
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:37,081
And while, yes,
people in other countries

353
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:42,081
do sometimes have to wait
slightly longer for some care,

354
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:45,881
it's not like Americans aren't
having to do that right now anyway.

355
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,721
Americans are just sometimes forced
to wait due to the expense.

356
00:18:49,881 --> 00:18:53,121
About half of U.S. adults
say they or a family member

357
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:56,921
put off or skipped care in the past year
because of the cost.

358
00:18:57,081 --> 00:18:58,681
And about one in eight say

359
00:18:58,841 --> 00:19:01,881
their medical condition got
worse because of that delay.

360
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,361
As for the uninsured,

361
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:06,801
they can wind up having to wait
on a literal line,

362
00:19:06,961 --> 00:19:09,921
seeking care with aid groups
like Remote Area Medical,

363
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:11,721
an organization that
travels the country,

364
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:14,281
setting up mobile clinics
to treat people for free

365
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:18,241
and which draws massive lines
wherever it goes.

366
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:22,081
Having got their place in line,
many camped out for the night.

367
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:25,441
Before dawn, this was the moment
they were waiting for.

368
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:29,401
Number one, come on down.
Number two.

369
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:31,761
-Two, right here.
-Number three?

370
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,321
One by one, patients
are let in for their chance

371
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:37,441
of a visit to a doctor,
a dentist, and an optician.

372
00:19:37,601 --> 00:19:39,801
At first, R.A.M. focused on communities

373
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:42,361
in remote areas
of developing countries.

374
00:19:42,521 --> 00:19:44,281
But Stan says he gradually
came to realize

375
00:19:44,441 --> 00:19:47,641
-the depth of need in the U.S.
-Today,

376
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:51,960
oh, 80% or more of what we do
is here in the United States.

377
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,840
It's unbelievable to me
that that is the case.

378
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,360
Normally, Americans hate it
when a British person

379
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,440
comes over to diagnose
what's wrong with you.

380
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,360
Believe me,
six seasons of YouTube comments

381
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,240
have made that very fucking clear.
The internet is mean!

382
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,600
And for all critics' talk of wait times
abroad, it is worth knowing,

383
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,360
less than 10%
of Britons or Canadians

384
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,720
say that their health system
need to be "rebuilt completely"

385
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,280
compared to 23% of people
here in the United States.

386
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,080
In fact, when London hosted
the 2012 Olympics,

387
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,280
the opening ceremony featured
a four-and-a-half-minute celebration

388
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,000
of the National Health Service,
featuring swing-dancing doctors

389
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,120
and nurses and children jumping up
and down on hospital beds.

390
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,040
As for Canada, they adore
their health service so much

391
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,280
that when they had a contest
for the greatest Canadian

392
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,760
of all time, this was the result.

393
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,800
The greatest Canadian,
as decided by you, is...

394
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,320
Tommy...

395
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,680
Douglas!

396
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,080
The mother of all national titles
goes to the father of Medicare.

397
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,880
Tommy Douglas! Yeah!

398
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,039
"Yeah! Tommy Douglas!
Yeah! Whoo!"

399
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:12,519
I mean, his master's thesis,
"The Problems of the Subnormal Family,"

400
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:14,439
endorsed eugenics,
but we're gonna ignore that

401
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:16,559
'cause it was the 1930s
and no one's perfect!

402
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:21,399
Give it up for Tommy! Whoo!

403
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:25,039
And look... Then, there is the final
big criticism

404
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:27,279
of Medicare for All,
which involves choice...

405
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:31,079
specifically, that it would
take away our ability to choose

406
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:33,479
the sort of health coverage
that we receive.

407
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:37,439
When I hear that health care is a right,
what I hear is,

408
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:39,599
"Health care will
no longer have choices."

409
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:41,479
Under Medicare for All,

410
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:44,399
your choice
of health coverage disappears.

411
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,999
Americans are still Americans.

412
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:48,479
We're not socialists.
We're not communists.

413
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:51,439
We like choice.
And we like to have choice

414
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:53,999
-in health care especially.
-Right, right.

415
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,119
Americans are Americans. It's true.
And they do like having choices.

416
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:00,879
It's why the number one
rated series on Netflix

417
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,999
is 40 minutes of looking
through the menu for something good.

418
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,679
It's basically America's
new national pastime.

419
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:13,679
And the fact you're applauding that
is a full cosign on that concept.

420
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:18,439
But the fact is, our current system
limits Americans' choices

421
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:21,918
far more than it expands them.
For starters, as a practical matter,

422
00:22:22,078 --> 00:22:24,238
most of us don't choose
our health insurance.

423
00:22:24,398 --> 00:22:26,118
We get what we get
through our employer.

424
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,598
And because of that,
choices like changing jobs

425
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:32,358
can become significantly harder.
And not just that.

426
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:36,598
Oftentimes, your choice of doctors
and hospitals is severely limited

427
00:22:36,758 --> 00:22:39,358
by which ones
your insurance will cover.

428
00:22:39,518 --> 00:22:43,198
Going out of your insurance network
can be prohibitively expensive.

429
00:22:43,358 --> 00:22:47,478
That is why people bend over
backwards to stay in network.

430
00:22:47,638 --> 00:22:51,838
And even when they do that,
it can still all go horribly wrong.

431
00:22:51,998 --> 00:22:53,718
While campaigning in 2018,

432
00:22:53,878 --> 00:22:57,518
Democratic Congresswoman
Katie Porter's appendix burst.

433
00:22:57,678 --> 00:22:59,958
Her first thought?
"How much would it cost?"

434
00:23:00,118 --> 00:23:01,438
I didn't call an ambulance

435
00:23:01,598 --> 00:23:04,038
'cause I knew it can cost a lot
if you call an ambulance.

436
00:23:04,198 --> 00:23:07,078
And I had specifically
had my manager drive me

437
00:23:07,238 --> 00:23:10,958
not to the closest hospital
but to the in-network hospital.

438
00:23:11,118 --> 00:23:13,318
Even though the hospital
was in her network,

439
00:23:13,478 --> 00:23:16,318
the surgeon who helped
save Porter's life was not.

440
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,878
and she got a bill
for nearly $3,000.

441
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:22,958
Exactly. You can get fucked
by taking an ambulance,

442
00:23:23,118 --> 00:23:25,598
you can get fucked by going
to the wrong hospital,

443
00:23:25,758 --> 00:23:27,958
or you can get fucked by going
to the right hospital

444
00:23:28,118 --> 00:23:29,558
but getting the wrong surgeon.

445
00:23:29,718 --> 00:23:32,558
The American health care system
gives you so many choices

446
00:23:32,718 --> 00:23:35,038
as to how you want to get fucked.

447
00:23:35,198 --> 00:23:39,357
It truly is
the "Kama Sutra" of health care.

448
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:43,957
And under Medicare for All,
that scenario would not happen.

449
00:23:44,117 --> 00:23:46,037
No doctor would be out of network

450
00:23:46,197 --> 00:23:48,637
because there wouldn't be
a network at all.

451
00:23:48,797 --> 00:23:51,997
And the truth about Americans'
current illusion of choice

452
00:23:52,157 --> 00:23:54,397
is that too often, because of cost,

453
00:23:54,557 --> 00:23:57,517
the choices our current system
forces people to make

454
00:23:57,677 --> 00:23:59,117
are ones like this.

455
00:23:59,277 --> 00:24:03,197
I prioritize the heart
stuff over the insulin

456
00:24:03,357 --> 00:24:06,877
because the heart stuff
is more immediate.

457
00:24:07,037 --> 00:24:11,597
I know over time, you know,
diabetes will kill me.

458
00:24:11,757 --> 00:24:14,997
But it'll take a longer time.

459
00:24:15,157 --> 00:24:18,357
And I know that without
the heart-failure drugs,

460
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:23,317
I only have 13% function of my heart.
I don't want to play with that.

461
00:24:23,477 --> 00:24:25,317
That's obviously terrible.

462
00:24:25,477 --> 00:24:28,317
A humane health care system
should not require people

463
00:24:28,477 --> 00:24:31,837
to pick their favorite organ.
Although, for the record,

464
00:24:31,997 --> 00:24:33,957
if you're ever asking me
my favorite organ,

465
00:24:34,117 --> 00:24:36,797
I'm going spleen every time.
Now, I know

466
00:24:36,957 --> 00:24:38,917
the brain and the heart get all
the attention, but I'm telling you,

467
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:42,117
when it comes to filtering blood,
you can't go wrong with the spleen.

468
00:24:42,277 --> 00:24:43,717
#IMASPLEENSTAN.

469
00:24:43,877 --> 00:24:46,357
#YAAASSPLEEN.

470
00:24:47,517 --> 00:24:50,436
So... so those are...

471
00:24:50,596 --> 00:24:53,556
those are the three main
criticisms of Medicare for All.

472
00:24:53,716 --> 00:24:55,836
And I should say it is not
just people on the right

473
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,876
who raise them. Some Democrats
have reservations too.

474
00:24:59,036 --> 00:25:00,356
Pete Buttigieg, for instance,

475
00:25:00,516 --> 00:25:03,196
prefers a different concept
to Medicare for All,

476
00:25:03,356 --> 00:25:06,916
-but with a catchily similar name.
-My health care vision is

477
00:25:07,076 --> 00:25:11,516
"Medicare for All Who Want It."
Let every American have the choice

478
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,076
to walk away from
the corporate, private plans

479
00:25:14,236 --> 00:25:16,596
and toward something better...
but when they're ready,

480
00:25:16,756 --> 00:25:19,996
because I trust Americans
to make that right choice.

481
00:25:20,156 --> 00:25:21,516
Okay, well, hold on there.

482
00:25:21,676 --> 00:25:23,836
You trust Americans
to make the right choice?

483
00:25:23,996 --> 00:25:27,596
You know Americans choose
to drink Bud Light, right?

484
00:25:27,756 --> 00:25:29,156
Which doesn't taste like beer

485
00:25:29,316 --> 00:25:31,356
so much as it tastes like
if beer somehow died

486
00:25:31,516 --> 00:25:33,956
and was discovered in its apartment
three weeks later.

487
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:36,436
But what Buttigieg is referring to

488
00:25:36,596 --> 00:25:38,876
when he says
"Medicare for All Who Want It"

489
00:25:39,036 --> 00:25:41,316
is basically the public option.
That is where the government

490
00:25:41,476 --> 00:25:43,516
doesn't replace
the private insurance system.

491
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:46,676
It just introduces its own plan
that would compete with it.

492
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,716
And it would definitely be an
improvement over what we have now.

493
00:25:49,876 --> 00:25:51,556
The problem is, it would leave

494
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,276
so much of our current
insurance infrastructure,

495
00:25:54,436 --> 00:25:56,036
with all of its problems, intact.

496
00:25:56,196 --> 00:25:59,396
So that's kind of like being
offered either a shit sandwich

497
00:25:59,556 --> 00:26:02,196
or a slightly smaller
shit sandwich with guac.

498
00:26:02,356 --> 00:26:05,875
I mean, I guess I'll take the second one
if you're asking, but honestly,

499
00:26:06,035 --> 00:26:09,995
the lack of guac wasn't really
my main fucking concern, there.

500
00:26:11,075 --> 00:26:15,115
And I'm not saying
any of this would be easy.

501
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:17,835
A lot would have to be figured out,
from how to impose the taxes

502
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:22,075
to pay for it in an equitable way,
to the consequences of eliminating

503
00:26:22,235 --> 00:26:24,275
the entire private
health insurance industry,

504
00:26:24,435 --> 00:26:28,395
which, by one estimate,
could displace 1.8 million workers.

505
00:26:28,555 --> 00:26:30,995
That is a legitimate thing
to be concerned about.

506
00:26:31,155 --> 00:26:35,875
And any plan would have to be designed
and rolled out very, very carefully.

507
00:26:36,035 --> 00:26:37,715
That is why both Warren
and Sanders talk about

508
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:40,955
the need for transition plans
for workers in their proposals.

509
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:43,835
And I get that big change is scary.

510
00:26:43,995 --> 00:26:46,675
It is human nature
to prefer the devil you know

511
00:26:46,835 --> 00:26:52,235
over an uncertain alternative,
but the devil you know is still a devil.

512
00:26:52,395 --> 00:26:57,515
And it is easy to forget that.
I shit on Britain a lot on this show,

513
00:26:57,675 --> 00:27:00,315
and I'm not gonna stop
any time soon,

514
00:27:00,475 --> 00:27:03,435
but one thing Britain does well
is the National Health Service.

515
00:27:03,595 --> 00:27:04,915
It's not perfect, of course.

516
00:27:05,075 --> 00:27:08,115
I'm not gonna swing dance
on a fucking bed about it.

517
00:27:08,275 --> 00:27:11,435
But I will be honest with you:
I've never had a bad experience

518
00:27:11,595 --> 00:27:16,195
and I don't know anyone who has.
But since moving to America,

519
00:27:16,355 --> 00:27:18,835
I don't think I have met
anyone who doesn't have

520
00:27:18,995 --> 00:27:21,754
at least one insurance industry
horror story.

521
00:27:21,914 --> 00:27:23,594
At this point,
the U.S. national anthem

522
00:27:23,754 --> 00:27:25,714
should just be everyone
in a stadium yelling

523
00:27:25,874 --> 00:27:29,354
about their insurance company
for two and a half minutes.

524
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:32,994
So for what it is worth, personally,
I am in favor of some version

525
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:36,154
of carefully designed
universal health coverage.

526
00:27:36,314 --> 00:27:39,274
And I will own all the things
about it that are difficult,

527
00:27:39,434 --> 00:27:43,594
including the fact that, politically, it
would be incredibly hard to get passed.

528
00:27:43,754 --> 00:27:47,994
But in return, anyone who's resistant
to significant change

529
00:27:48,154 --> 00:27:51,674
is going to have to own
all the flaws of our current system,

530
00:27:51,834 --> 00:27:53,634
one in which,
when Americans get sick,

531
00:27:53,794 --> 00:27:55,554
they can find themselves
comparison shopping

532
00:27:55,714 --> 00:27:57,034
with a burst appendix,

533
00:27:57,194 --> 00:27:59,634
flipping a coin between
lifesaving medications,

534
00:27:59,794 --> 00:28:02,474
and praying they can come up
with a catchy enough hashtag

535
00:28:02,634 --> 00:28:05,754
to cover their care. Although,
for what it's worth on that one,

536
00:28:05,914 --> 00:28:10,954
until we fix this fucking mess,
if anyone gets a ruptured spleen,

537
00:28:11,114 --> 00:28:15,434
please feel free
to use #YAAASSPLEEN.

538
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:20,434
That's all yours. Good luck with it.
And now this.

539
00:28:20,594 --> 00:28:23,634
And now, it's someone's job
to send video clips

540
00:28:23,794 --> 00:28:26,874
of the Westminster Dog Show
to local stations.

541
00:28:27,034 --> 00:28:29,674
And this year,
that someone fucked up.

542
00:28:30,434 --> 00:28:33,394
There is a new top dog at
the Westminster Kennel Club.

543
00:28:33,554 --> 00:28:36,473
Siba took home the top prize
at the event last night.

544
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:40,433
The standard poodle named Siba
won Best in Shown last night.

545
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:44,553
Siba won Best in Show last night at
the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.

546
00:28:44,713 --> 00:28:49,033
-There is a new Best in Show.
-There's a new top dog at Westminster.

547
00:28:49,193 --> 00:28:53,393
A poodle named the top dog
at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.

548
00:28:53,553 --> 00:28:56,553
She was chosen from seven finalists
that included a whippet...

549
00:28:56,713 --> 00:29:00,713
She was chosen from seven finalists...
oh, a little rear shot there.

550
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:02,993
Well, meet Siba, standard poodle.

551
00:29:03,153 --> 00:29:05,273
-Took home the top...
-Turn around, please.

552
00:29:05,433 --> 00:29:08,033
Dog experts say don't be fooled.
She's more than just good looks.

553
00:29:08,193 --> 00:29:09,833
Why are we showing this shot again?

554
00:29:09,993 --> 00:29:11,513
-Oh, gosh.
-Brittany.

555
00:29:11,673 --> 00:29:14,953
That might have been why she won.
I mean, who knows?

556
00:29:16,513 --> 00:29:18,033
That's our show.
Thanks so much for watching.

557
00:29:18,193 --> 00:29:20,233
See you next week. Good night!
