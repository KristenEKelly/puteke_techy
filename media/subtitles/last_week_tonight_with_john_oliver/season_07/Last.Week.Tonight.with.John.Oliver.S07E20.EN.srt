1
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:26,500
HI THERE!

2
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:27,400
WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

3
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:28,643
STILL TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK

4
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:29,776
VOID THAT LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,266
THE INSIDE OF AN EGG, FROM THE

6
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:31,934
OFF-WHITE WALLS TO THE EERIE

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,042
SILENCE TO THE CREATURE IN THE

8
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:33,900
MIDDLE WHO RESEMBLES

9
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,066
AN UNBORN CHICKEN.

10
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:36,033
YOU'RE GETTING THE FULL EGG

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,800
EXPERIENCE RIGHT NOW.

12
00:00:37,867 --> 00:00:39,107
AND LET'S DIVE STRAIGHT IN WITH

13
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:40,300
THE CORONAVIRUS, THE REASON

14
00:00:40,367 --> 00:00:41,734
THAT WE'RE ALL GOOGLING

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,433
"FACE MASK DROPLETS" AND THEN

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,600
DOING IT AGAIN BUT WITH THE

17
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:46,567
SAFE SEARCH ON.

18
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:48,467
THIS WEEK SAW THE GRIM MILESTONE

19
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:52,400
OF 150,000 DEATHS IN THE U.S.,

20
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:53,867
WHICH YOU WOULD THINK WOULD

21
00:00:53,934 --> 00:00:54,600
IMPEL PEOPLE HERE TO TAKE THE

22
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:55,433
VIRUS SERIOUSLY.

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,166
YET STORIES KEEP CROPPING UP OF

24
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:57,433
MASSIVE GATHERINGS, FROM AT

25
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,780
LEAST 43 PEOPLE TESTING POSITIVE

26
00:00:58,834 --> 00:01:01,133
FOR CORONAVIRUS AFTER ATTENDING

27
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,734
A MICHIGAN HOUSE PARTY, TO MORE

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,009
THAN 700 PEOPLE ATTENDING A NEW

29
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:05,633
JERSEY AIRBNB PARTY, PROMPTING

30
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,266
THIS RESPONSE FROM THE GOVERNOR.

31
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,600
YES, IT'S HOT.

32
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,900
YES, IT'S SUMMER.

33
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:12,433
YES, WE ALL WANT, AND IN MANY

34
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,166
CASES, NEED, TO BLOW OFF SOME

35
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:16,400
STEAM, BUT THIS IS NO TIME FOR

36
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:18,233
ANYONE TO BE VYING FOR INDUCTION

37
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,767
INTO THE KNUCKLEHEAD HALL OF

38
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:21,300
FAME.

39
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:22,734
YEAH, AND FOR THE

40
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,166
RECORD, NEW JERSEY'S KNUCKLEHEAD

41
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:25,233
HALL OF FAME IS BENNIES;

42
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,233
THAT GABAGOOL FROM PHILLY WHO

43
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,066
THOUGHT HE COULD PUMP HIS OWN

44
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:28,133
GAS; CHRIS CHRISTIE;

45
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,309
CHRIS CHRISTIE AGAIN BECAUSE OF

46
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:31,033
THAT TIME HE SAT ON THE BEACH;

47
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,209
RALPH CIFARETTO; SLOW DRIVERS;

48
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:34,367
FAST DRIVERS; AND JARED KUSHNER.

49
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:35,734
YEAH!

50
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,066
JARED'S FROM JERSEY!

51
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:38,433
I KNOW HE LOOKS LIKE HE JUST

52
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,643
EMERGED FROM A VAT OF VASELINE

53
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:40,743
FULLY FORMED AS A SHINY HAUNTED

54
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,700
HATE MANNEQUIN, BUT HE'S

55
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:43,767
ACTUALLY FROM THE GARDEN STATE.

56
00:01:43,834 --> 00:01:45,200
AND THAT WASN'T EVEN THE MOST

57
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:46,300
IRRITATING RECENT MASS

58
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:47,700
GATHERING.

59
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:48,810
THIS MORNING, THIS VIRAL

60
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:50,200
VIDEO FROM A CHAINSMOKERS

61
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:51,476
CONCERT IN THE HAMPTONS OVER THE

62
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,166
WEEKEND, WITH FANS SEEMINGLY

63
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:54,443
IGNORING ALL SOCIAL DISTANCING,

64
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:55,667
HAS NEW YORK'S GOVERNOR UP IN

65
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:57,300
ARMS.

66
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,834
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

67
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,910
IMAGINE RISKING YOUR LIFE TO SEE

68
00:01:59,934 --> 00:02:02,867
THE CHAINSMOKERS.

69
00:02:02,934 --> 00:02:04,333
ALTHOUGH IT AT LEAST ADDS A NEW

70
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,476
DIMENSION TO THEIR LYRICS, NOW

71
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,509
THAT "WE AIN'T EVER GETTING

72
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:07,700
OLDER" COULD REASONABLY BE

73
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:08,834
FOLLOWED BY "BECAUSE WE

74
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,233
CONTRACTED A DEADLY VIRUS AT OUR

75
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,767
STUPID CONCERT IN SOUTHAMPTON."

76
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:14,133
AND TO BE FAIR, THE EVENT

77
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,667
ORGANIZERS AND PERFORMERS SAY

78
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:18,033
THAT THEY FOLLOWED ALL CDC AND

79
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,100
STATE GUIDELINES.

80
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:19,734
AND THEY CERTAINLY DID THEIR

81
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,500
PART TO TRY AND DRIVE PEOPLE

82
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:21,767
AWAY.

83
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:23,533
THE CONCERT ALSO FEATURED A

84
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,066
PERFORMANCE BY GOLDMAN SACHS CEO

85
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:26,142
DAVID SOLOMON, WHO MOONLIGHTS AS

86
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,633
A DJ.

87
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,934
YES.

88
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,066
HE DOES.

89
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:32,066
HE APPARENTLY CALLS HIMSELF

90
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:34,533
"DJ D-SOL," AND ON SPOTIFY, HE

91
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,200
HAS NOT ONE, NOT TWO, BUT SEVEN

92
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:37,834
REMIXES OF THE R&B CLASSIC

93
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,433
"RESCUE ME," ALL OF WHICH ARE...

94
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,700
AND I SAY THIS AS RESPECTFULLY

95
00:02:40,767 --> 00:02:42,934
AS POSSIBLE... FUCKING GARBAGE.

96
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,700
AND WHILE I PERSONALLY DON'T

97
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:46,400
UNDERSTAND THE ATTRACTION IN

98
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:47,667
WATCHING DJ BUSINESS

99
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:51,300
BRUCE WILLIS HIT PLAY

100
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:52,066
ON AN iPHONE, IT IS CLEAR,

101
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:52,800
RECKLESSNESS IS ABOUNDING RIGHT

102
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:54,027
NOW, HEIGHTENING THE NEED FOR

103
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:55,734
STRONG LEADERSHIP.

104
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,009
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, WE'RE GETTING

105
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:58,433
THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THAT.

106
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,633
JUST A WEEK AFTER TRUMP WAS

107
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,776
GIVEN CREDIT FOR "SHIFTING HIS

108
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,100
RHETORIC" BY URGING AMERICANS TO

109
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,433
WEAR MASKS, HE DID SOMETHING

110
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,934
THAT, EVEN FOR HIM, WAS

111
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,266
SHOCKINGLY RECKLESS.

112
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,800
THE PRESIDENT AGAIN USED HIS

113
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:10,333
TWITTER ACCOUNT TO SPREAD

114
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,734
MISINFORMATION, TWEETING VIDEO

115
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,367
OF A DOCTOR DENOUNCING THE USE

116
00:03:13,433 --> 00:03:14,934
OF MASKS AND PROMOTING

117
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,100
HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE.

118
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,300
THAT DOCTOR, WHO WAS ONLY

119
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:18,543
LICENSED TO PRACTICE MEDICINE IN

120
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:20,367
TEXAS LAST NOVEMBER, HAS A

121
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,000
HISTORY OF OUTRAGEOUS

122
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:23,400
STATEMENTS, SUCH AS SAYING

123
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:24,800
HEALTH PROBLEMS CAN BE CAUSED BY

124
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:26,200
DEMONS.

125
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:27,600
YEAH!

126
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:28,743
THAT'S PRETTY UPSETTING COMING

127
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:29,900
FROM A DOCTOR.

128
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:31,207
YOU'D EXPECT THAT BULLSHIT FROM

129
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:32,276
SOME IDIOT WHO CLAIMS TO KNOW

130
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,734
ABOUT MEDICINE BUT DOESN'T HAVE

131
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,367
A MEDICAL LICENSE, LIKE YOUR

132
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:38,467
DIPSHIT UNCLE OR DR. PHIL.

133
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:41,633
BUT FROM A LICENSED MEDICAL

134
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,300
PROFESSIONAL, THAT IS WILDLY

135
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:43,200
IRRESPONSIBLE.

136
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:44,033
SHE'S ALSO REPORTEDLY CLAIMED

137
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,276
THAT ALIEN DNA IS BEING USED IN

138
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,333
MEDICAL TREATMENTS, THE

139
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,834
GOVERNMENT IS RUN BY REPTILIANS,

140
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,943
AND THAT SCIENTISTS ARE COOKING

141
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:50,233
UP A VACCINE TO PREVENT PEOPLE

142
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,100
FROM BECOMING RELIGIOUS.

143
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:52,934
WHICH, LOOK, WE ALREADY HAVE

144
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,100
THAT LAST ONE.

145
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,066
IT'S CALLED "KIRK CAMERON'S

146
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:58,000
SAVING CHRISTMAS."

147
00:03:58,066 --> 00:03:59,567
POP THAT DVD IN AND 79 MINUTES

148
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:00,967
LATER YOU'LL BE CONVINCED NO GOD

149
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,433
WOULD LET THIS HAPPEN.

150
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,367
AND WHEN HER COMMENTS WERE

151
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:08,509
POINTED OUT TO THE PRESIDENT, HE

152
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:12,166
REFUSED TO BACK DOWN.

153
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:12,800
SHE WAS ON AIR ALONG WITH

154
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:13,400
MANY OTHER DOCTORS.

155
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:14,266
THEY WERE BIG FANS OF

156
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,066
HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE, AND I

157
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:15,834
THOUGHT SHE WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE

158
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,400
IN THE SENSE THAT, FROM WHERE

159
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,400
SHE CAME...

160
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,507
I DON'T KNOW WHICH COUNTRY

161
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:21,100
SHE COMES FROM, BUT SHE SAID

162
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:21,834
THAT SHE'S HAD TREMENDOUS

163
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,033
SUCCESS WITH HUNDREDS OF

164
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,900
DIFFERENT PATIENTS.

165
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:24,976
AND I THOUGHT HER VOICE WAS AN

166
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,900
IMPORTANT VOICE, BUT I KNOW

167
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:26,867
NOTHING ABOUT HER.

168
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,166
WOW.

169
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:29,443
HE THINKS HER VOICE IS IMPORTANT

170
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:30,543
BUT ADMITS TO KNOWING NOTHING

171
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:33,367
ELSE ABOUT HER.

172
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:34,033
THAT IS NOT THE PHILOSOPHY YOU

173
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,467
WANT WHEN VETTING MEDICAL

174
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:35,900
EXPERTS.

175
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,100
IT'S BARELY A PHILOSOPHY YOU

176
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,700
WANT ON "THE VOICE."

177
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:39,834
SURE, THE JUDGES START BY

178
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,934
KNOWING NOTHING ABOUT THE

179
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,934
CONTESTANTS BESIDES THEIR VOICE,

180
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,009
BUT ONCE THEIR INTERESTS ARE

181
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,500
PIQUED, THEY KNOW TO TURN THE

182
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:47,100
FUCK AROUND TO INVESTIGATE.

183
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,000
AND DOWNPLAYING THE RISKS OF

184
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:50,700
THIS CAN HAVE DIRE CONSEQUENCES.

185
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:54,900
ON THURSDAY, HERMAN CAIN DIED,

186
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:56,433
ABOUT SIX WEEKS AFTER ATTENDING

187
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,200
A TRUMP RALLY IN TULSA WHERE HE

188
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:57,834
WAS PHOTOGRAPHED WITHOUT A MASK,

189
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,734
LATER TWEETING THAT "PEOPLE ARE

190
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,633
FED UP" OF BEING MADE TO WEAR

191
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,700
THEM.

192
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,600
AND THIS, SADLY, WON'T BE THE

193
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:03,810
LAST TIME WE SEE PEOPLE FIND OUT

194
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:04,467
THE HARD WAY HOW SERIOUS THIS

195
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:05,700
IS.

196
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:06,767
BECAUSE ON WEDNESDAY, YET

197
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,810
ANOTHER MEMBER OF CONGRESS

198
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:09,200
TESTED POSITIVE.

199
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:10,600
TEXAS CONGRESSMAN

200
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:11,800
LOUIE GOHMERT, SPOTTED ON

201
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:13,800
CAPITOL HILL JUST YESTERDAY

202
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:15,166
MASKLESS, WALKING NEAR

203
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:16,400
ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL BARR,

204
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:17,767
GETTING HIS DIAGNOSIS AT THE

205
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:19,767
WHITE HOUSE THIS MORNING.

206
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:20,943
BUT GOHMERT DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY

207
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:22,500
ISOLATE HIMSELF.

208
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:24,066
INSTEAD HE RETURNED TO HIS

209
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:26,166
CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE TO TELL HIS

210
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:31,433
STAFF IN PERSON.

211
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,000
WHAT?

212
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:32,934
IF THAT'S TRUE, IT'S ABSURD.

213
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,767
BECAUSE "I'M CARRYING A HIGHLY

214
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:34,667
INFECTIOUS DISEASE" IS NEVER

215
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:35,843
NEWS THAT NEEDS TO BE TOLD IN

216
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:37,100
PERSON, ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE

217
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,533
ARE PLENTY OF BETTER WAYS TO DO

218
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,066
IT.

219
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:41,767
YOU COULD HIRE A SKYWRITER TO

220
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:42,910
WRITE "I'M POSI FOR CORONA."

221
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:43,934
YOU COULD MAKE A CUSTOM

222
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:45,567
CROSSWORD PUZZLE THAT SPELLS OUT

223
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:47,200
"YOUR BOSS HAS THE CORONA."

224
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:48,376
YOU COULD GO ON CAMEO AND GET

225
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,409
STEVE GUTTENBERG TO RECORD A

226
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:53,300
MESSAGE FOR THEM.

227
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:54,400
SERIOUSLY, HE'LL DO IT.

228
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:55,066
LOOK.

229
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:57,600
HEY, QUICK MESSAGE FOR

230
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:58,734
LOUIE GOHMERT'S STAFF:

231
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,400
YOUR BOSS HAS THE 'RONA.

232
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:00,333
OBVIOUSLY HE'D HAVE TO BE A

233
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,166
COMPLETE IDIOT TO TELL YOU THAT

234
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:01,834
IN PERSON, SO HE GOT ME,

235
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,633
STEVE GUTTENBERG, TO TELL YOU

236
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:10,700
INSTEAD.

237
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,834
STAY 6 FEET AWAY OR MORE FROM

238
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,233
HIM AND WEAR A MASK.

239
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:17,133
I WAS IN "POLICE ACADEMY"!

240
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:18,133
BYE!

241
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,446
BEST $150 I EVER SPENT.

242
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,166
NOW, GOHMERT INSISTS HE NOTIFIED

243
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:21,400
HIS STAFF BY PHONE, AND ONLY

244
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,576
THEN DID HE VISIT HIS OFFICE,

245
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,667
WEARING A MASK.

246
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:25,400
BUT SHOWING UP IN PERSON AT ALL

247
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:29,233
IS STILL THE LEVEL OF

248
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:30,500
CLUELESSNESS YOU'D KIND OF

249
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,720
EXPECT FROM A GUY WHO ALWAYS

250
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:32,867
LOOKS LIKE HE HASN'T YET

251
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,700
REALIZED HIS TOUPEE BLEW OFF.

252
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:34,633
AND THIS IS REPORTEDLY JUST THE

253
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,567
BEGINNING OF HIS STAFF'S

254
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:36,500
PROBLEMS WITH HIM.

255
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:38,100
THIS IS A LETTER FROM AN AIDE

256
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,176
TO LOUIE GOHMERT, POLITICO SAYS.

257
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,133
"THANK YOU FOR LETTING OUR

258
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
OFFICE KNOW LOUIE TESTED

259
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,500
POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS."

260
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:43,500
"WHEN YOU WRITE YOUR STORY, CAN

261
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:44,934
YOU INCLUDE THE FACT THAT LOUIE

262
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,176
REQUIRES FULL STAFF TO BE IN THE

263
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,800
OFFICE, INCLUDING THREE INTERNS,

264
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:49,400
SO THAT WE CAN BE AN EXAMPLE TO

265
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:50,700
AMERICA ON HOW TO OPEN UP

266
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:51,967
SAFELY.

267
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:53,200
WHEN PROBING THE OFFICE, YOU

268
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:55,200
MIGHT WANT TO ASK HOW OFTEN WERE

269
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:56,934
PEOPLE BERATED FOR WEARING

270
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,033
MASKS."

271
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,633
WOW.

272
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,940
AND WHILE GOHMERT DISPUTES THAT

273
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:03,007
CLAIM TOO, IT GOES WITHOUT

274
00:07:03,033 --> 00:07:04,276
SAYING, NOBODY SHOULD BE BERATED

275
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,367
FOR WEARING A MASK.

276
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:06,700
UNLESS, OF COURSE, IT'S HANGING

277
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:07,810
BELOW THEIR CHIN, WHICH IS A BIT

278
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:09,266
LIKE PUTTING A DIAPER AROUND A

279
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,400
BABY'S ANKLES.

280
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:11,900
YOU CLEARLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND

281
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:13,734
HOW BUTTS WORK.

282
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,133
AND LOOK, THIS RECKLESS

283
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,066
INDIFFERENCE... WHETHER IT'S

284
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:17,834
COMING FROM THESE IDIOTS, THIS

285
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,033
IDIOT, THAT IDIOT, THIS

286
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,500
ESPECIALLY IDIOTIC IDIOT,

287
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:22,700
OR THE MOST POWERFUL IDIOT

288
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:23,567
OF ALL... IS COSTING PEOPLE

289
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:25,166
THEIR LIVES.

290
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:26,409
AND IT'S PAST TIME THAT WE START

291
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:27,476
PROTECTING EACH OTHER AND TAKING

292
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,967
THIS SERIOUSLY.

293
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,066
BECAUSE THANKS TO THESE GUYS,

294
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:32,467
THE KNUCKLEHEAD HALL OF FAME IS

295
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:34,867
GETTING PRETTY FUCKING CROWDED.

296
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:39,433
AND NOW THIS.

297
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,266
AND NON

298
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,800
EXTRA $150, STEVE GUTENBERG

299
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:45,300
RAINSTORMS NAMES FOR A

300
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:47,300
COWORKER'S NEW DOG.

301
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:51,066
LET'S SEE.

302
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:53,100
DAISY, DANIEL.

303
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,767
FRANK.

304
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:56,900
BINGO.

305
00:07:56,967 --> 00:07:57,367
SPORT.

306
00:07:57,433 --> 00:08:02,767
VIRGINIA WOOF.

307
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:03,300
BUMBLEBEE.

308
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:09,166
ALL, DR. WAGS-A-LOT.

309
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:11,133
BUT, YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG WITH

310
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,333
BINGO.

311
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,767
AND NOW, AW,

312
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:21,500
THANKS, STEVE.

313
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,066
MOVING ON.

314
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:22,734
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

315
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,600
HISTORY, A SUBJECT SO

316
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:24,166
FASCINATING, WE'RE SOMETIMES

317
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:24,800
WILLING TO DO CRAZY EXPERIMENTS

318
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:26,166
SCIENTISTS WERE ABLE TO MIMIC

319
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:26,767
NESYAMUN'S VOICE BY RECREATING

320
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:27,400
HIS MOUTH AND VOCAL CORDS WITH A

321
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:27,934
3D PRINTER.

322
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,767
IT ALLOWED THEM TO PRODUCE A

323
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:29,533
SINGLE SOUND.

324
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,867
EH.

325
00:08:30,934 --> 00:08:32,266
EH.

326
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,233
EH.

327
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,433
EXCELLENT.

328
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,233
FINALLY AN ANSWER TO THE

329
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,533
QUESTION THAT SCHOLARS HAVE

330
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,367
WHAT WOULD AN

331
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:40,100
ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SOUND LIKE IF

332
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,400
HE ORGASMED WHILE TAKING

333
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:44,300
ANTIDEPRESSANTS?

334
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:45,567
BUT LOOK, SADLY, HISTORY ISN'T

335
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,033
ALWAYS FUN, WEIRD MUMMY

336
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,700
VENTRILOQUY.

337
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:49,767
IT CAN BE PAINFUL TOO, AS

338
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:50,633
AMERICA HAS RECENTLY BEEN

339
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,843
REMINDED, BECAUSE GEORGE FLOYD'S

340
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:53,066
MURDER HAS FORCED A HARD

341
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,567
NATIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS

342
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:56,467
COUNTRY'S PRESENT, WHICH IS

343
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:58,200
IMPOSSIBLE TO DO EFFECTIVELY

344
00:08:58,266 --> 00:08:59,443
WITHOUT RE-EXAMINING ITS PAST.

345
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:00,367
AND UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S NOT A

346
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:01,673
CONVERSATION THAT ALL AMERICANS

347
00:09:01,734 --> 00:09:02,834
ARE WELL-EQUIPPED TO HAVE,

348
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,800
BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME

349
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:04,667
EMBARRASSING GAPS IN MANY

350
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:05,433
PEOPLE'S KNOWLEDGE OF U.S.

351
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
HISTORY.

352
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:07,400
JUST LOOK WHAT HAPPENED A FEW

353
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:09,033
WEEKS BACK, WHEN THE PRESIDENT,

354
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,266
IN THE MIDST OF NATIONWIDE

355
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,133
BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTS,

356
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,667
ANNOUNCED PLANS TO HOLD A RALLY

357
00:09:13,734 --> 00:09:15,967
IN TULSA ON JUNE 19TH, A

358
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:17,142
DECISION ASTONISHINGLY TONE-DEAF

359
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,333
FOR TWO KEY REASONS.

360
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,133
NEXT FRIDAY, JUNE 19TH, IS

361
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,467
JUNETEENTH, AN ANNUAL HOLIDAY

362
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:23,743
COMMEMORATING THE END OF SLAVERY

363
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:25,700
IN THE U.S.

364
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:27,533
AS FOR TULSA, 99 YEARS AGO THIS

365
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,367
MONTH IN 1921, THE CITY

366
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:31,333
WITNESSED THE TULSA RACE

367
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,967
MASSACRE, ONE OF THE NATION'S

368
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:34,133
WORST OUTBREAKS OF RACIAL

369
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,333
VIOLENCE, RECENTLY PORTRAYED IN

370
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,200
HBO'S "WATCHMEN."

371
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:41,376
NOW, THE REASON THEY'RE

372
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,200
MENTIONING "WATCHMEN" THERE IS,

373
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:44,409
A LOT OF AMERICANS LEARNED ABOUT

374
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:45,934
THE TULSA RACE MASSACRE FOR THE

375
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,200
VERY FIRST TIME, NEARLY A

376
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:48,376
CENTURY AFTER IT HAPPENED, FROM

377
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,700
WATCHING THAT SHOW.

378
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:50,800
BASICALLY, THE NIGHT THAT

379
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:53,066
EPISODE AIRED, MANY WHITE

380
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:54,767
AMERICANS WENT, "HOLY SHIT!

381
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:55,843
I HAD NO IDEA THIS HAPPENED!"

382
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:56,910
WHILE MANY BLACK AMERICANS WENT,

383
00:09:56,934 --> 00:09:58,233
"HOLY SHIT!

384
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,133
WHITE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO FREAK

385
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,533
THE FUCK OUT WHEN THEY FIND OUT

386
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,066
THIS HAPPENED!

387
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:03,934
DEBBIE AT WORK IS GOING TO WANT

388
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,066
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION."

389
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:06,343
THE COVERAGE OF THAT TRUMP RALLY

390
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:07,734
DIDN'T JUST INTRODUCE MANY

391
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,500
AMERICANS TO THAT MASSACRE, BUT

392
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,667
ALSO TO THE VERY CONCEPT OF

393
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:16,667
JUNETEENTH, THE DAY THAT

394
00:10:16,734 --> 00:10:17,910
COMMEMORATES WHEN UNION TROOPS

395
00:10:17,934 --> 00:10:19,233
INFORMED TEXAS THAT ENSLAVED

396
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,300
PEOPLE THAT MUST FINALLY BE

397
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:21,800
FREED,

398
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:23,233
TWO YEARS AFTER SLAVERY HAD BEEN

399
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:23,767
ABOLISHED, BY THE WAY.

400
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:24,667
A RECENT POLL SHOWED A SHOCKING

401
00:10:24,734 --> 00:10:25,433
48% OF AMERICANS WERE EITHER

402
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,780
"NOT AT ALL" OR "NOT VERY AWARE"

403
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,667
OF JUNETEENTH.

404
00:10:27,734 --> 00:10:30,266
WHICH IS NOT GOOD.

405
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,567
I MEAN, IT'D BE FINE IF NEARLY

406
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:32,867
HALF OF AMERICANS WERE UNAWARE

407
00:10:32,934 --> 00:10:34,266
OF GROUNDHOG DAY, THE

408
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,667
MEANINGLESS DATE WHEN AN IDIOT

409
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:37,033
DRESSED LIKE GOTH WILLY WONKA

410
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,567
HOLDS UP A NON-CLAIRVOYANT

411
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:38,367
WOODCHUCK WHOSE

412
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:39,333
FACE SOMEHOW SCREAMS

413
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,767
"I HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO."

414
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:42,600
BUT JUNETEENTH ACTUALLY MEANS

415
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,533
SOMETHING.

416
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,500
AND THAT'S JUST ONE OF MANY GAPS

417
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:46,609
IN KNOWLEDGE THAT SOME ARE NOW

418
00:10:46,633 --> 00:10:48,934
REALIZING THEY HAVE.

419
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,200
JUST WATCH JOY BEHAR TRY TO

420
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:51,300
EXPLAIN WHY STATUES OF

421
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:52,443
GEORGE WASHINGTON SHOULD BE LEFT

422
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:53,967
ALONE, AND IN DOING SO, ACTUALLY

423
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:55,166
LEARNING SOMETHING.

424
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:57,200
BUT GEORGE WASHINGTON,

425
00:10:57,266 --> 00:10:58,567
BESIDES BEING A FOUNDING FATHER

426
00:10:58,633 --> 00:11:00,367
AND A GREAT GENERAL AND SOMEBODY

427
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:02,166
WHO WAS SO INSTRUMENTAL IN THIS

428
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:03,433
UNION THAT WE HAVE, IN THIS

429
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,100
REPUBLIC, ALSO FREED HIS SLAVES.

430
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,600
SO IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE SOMEBODY

431
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,000
DOWN, TAKE DOWN...

432
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:08,834
MMM.

433
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,100
THOMAS JEFFERSON, WHO

434
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,066
DIDN'T... WHO DIDN'T FREE HIS

435
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:11,533
SLAVES.

436
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
NO?

437
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:13,700
SUNNY DISAGREES.

438
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:16,233
HE DIDN'T FREE HIS SLAVES.

439
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,066
HE DIDN'T.

440
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:17,900
HE ACTUALLY SPENT THE LAST

441
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:18,500
YEAR OF HIS LIFE...

442
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:19,367
OH.

443
00:11:19,433 --> 00:11:20,700
RET... LIKE, RELENTLESSLY

444
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:23,033
PURSUING SLAVES THAT TRIED TO

445
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,867
RUN AWAY.

446
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:28,500
HE WAS A HORRIBLE SLAVE OWNER.

447
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:29,867
YEAH, HE WAS.

448
00:11:29,934 --> 00:11:31,433
AS USUAL, SUNNY HOSTIN IS VERY

449
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,233
RIGHT, AND MEGHAN McCAIN IS

450
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,367
VERY "THERE."

451
00:11:37,433 --> 00:11:38,443
BECAUSE, WHILE WASHINGTON DID

452
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:39,166
PROMISE TO FREE HIS SLAVES IN

453
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:39,967
HIS WILL, IT SPECIFIED THEY

454
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:40,700
WOULDN'T GAIN THEIR FREEDOM

455
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:41,700
UNTIL HIS WIFE'S DEATH.

456
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:42,810
SO ONLY ONE PERSON WAS FREED

457
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:43,734
IMMEDIATELY AFTER WASHINGTON

458
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,967
DIED OUT OF OVER A HUNDRED.

459
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:47,734
ALSO, HE ACTUALLY BECAME A SLAVE

460
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,633
OWNER AT JUST 11 YEARS OLD...

461
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,667
A FACT SO HORRIFYING, IT'S HARD

462
00:11:51,734 --> 00:11:53,300
TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

463
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:54,667
AT THE VERY LEAST, THE STORY OF

464
00:11:54,734 --> 00:11:55,910
HIM CHOPPING DOWN A CHERRY TREE

465
00:11:55,934 --> 00:11:57,533
AS A CHILD AND ADMITTING IT TO

466
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,700
HIS FATHER BY SAYING "I CANNOT

467
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:01,934
TELL A LIE" GETS WAY LESS

468
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,734
CHARMING IF THE NEXT PART IS HIS

469
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,700
PARENTS SAYING, "THANK YOU FOR

470
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:05,166
BEING HONEST, GEORGE.

471
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:07,433
AS A REWARD, HERE ARE SOME HUMAN

472
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,567
BEINGS TO OWN."

473
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:10,333
AND THE THING IS, JOY BEHAR'S

474
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:17,467
VERSION OF HISTORY, WHILE NOT

475
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:18,033
ACCURATE, IS DEFINITELY MORE

476
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,700
PALATABLE, ESPECIALLY FOR WHITE

477
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:19,400
PEOPLE, AND SEEKING OUT

478
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:20,166
MISLEADINGLY COMFORTING VERSIONS

479
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:21,343
OF HISTORY IS A PATTERN WE'VE

480
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:22,700
SEEN AGAIN AND AGAIN THIS YEAR.

481
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:23,843
FROM THE NUMBER-ONE MOVIE ON

482
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:24,533
NETFLIX DURING THE PROTESTS

483
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,533
FOLLOWING GEORGE FLOYD'S MURDER

484
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,533
BEING "THE HELP" TO JUST LAST

485
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,533
WEEK, WHEN SENATOR TOM COTTON

486
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,400
SAID SCHOOLS SHOULD LOSE FEDERAL

487
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:31,166
FUNDING IF THEY TEACH A

488
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:31,700
CURRICULUM BASED ON

489
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:33,000
"THE NEW YORK TIMES'"

490
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:34,533
1619 PROJECT, WHICH BRINGS

491
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,700
SLAVERY INTO THE FOREFRONT OF

492
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:37,667
AMERICAN HISTORY.

493
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:39,433
AND PERHAPS THE MOST ABSURD

494
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,509
DISCONNECT WAS, IN THE WAKE OF

495
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:45,934
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECH AT A

496
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
...EULOGY FOR

497
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:52,734
JOHN LEWIS THIS WEEK, IN

498
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,367
WHICH OBAMA ADVOCATED FOR

499
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:54,033
ABOLISHING THE FILIBUSTER TO

500
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,700
PROTECT THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT,

501
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:55,433
TUCKER CARLSON HAD THIS TO SAY:

502
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,100
IMAGINE IF SOME GREASY

503
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:56,734
POLITICIAN SHOWED UP AT YOUR

504
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,500
LOVED ONE'S FUNERAL AND STARTED

505
00:12:57,567 --> 00:12:58,609
THROWING AROUND STUPID PARTISAN

506
00:12:58,633 --> 00:12:59,433
TALKING POINTS ABOUT SENATE

507
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,633
PROCEDURE.

508
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:06,800
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT?

509
00:13:06,867 --> 00:13:07,433
YOU WOULD BE SHOCKED IF THAT

510
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:07,867
HAPPENED.

511
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:08,600
YOU WOULD PROBABLY WALK OUT.

512
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:09,166
DESECRATING A FUNERAL WITH

513
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:10,133
CAMPAIGN SLOGANS, WHAT KIND OF

514
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,700
PERSON WOULD DO THAT?

515
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:15,633
WEIGHT.

516
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,700
WHAT KIND OF PERSON

517
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:18,467
WOULD HONOR A FRIEND'S LEGACY BY

518
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:19,266
CONTINUING TO ADVOCATE FOR

519
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:19,900
VOTING RIGHTS?

520
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:20,734
I CAN THINK OF ONE.

521
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,734
JOHN FUCKING LEWIS WOULD DO

522
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,667
THAT.

523
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:23,600
AND THE TRUTH IS, WITH SO MANY

524
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:24,533
PEOPLE MISUNDERSTANDING OUR

525
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,834
HISTORY, EITHER BY ACCIDENT OR

526
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,667
VERY MUCH ON PURPOSE, WE THOUGHT

527
00:13:26,734 --> 00:13:28,867
TONIGHT IT MIGHT BE WORTH

528
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:29,633
TALKING ABOUT HOW THE HISTORY OF

529
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,100
RACE IN AMERICA IS CURRENTLY

530
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,467
TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS... WHAT THE

531
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:35,467
GAPS ARE, WHY THEY'RE THERE, AND

532
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:36,033
HOW WE CAN FILL THEM.

533
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,900
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

534
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:38,400
THAT THERE ARE NO NATIONAL

535
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:40,000
STANDARDS FOR WHAT TOPICS OR

536
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:41,467
FIGURES STUDENTS MUST LEARN

537
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:42,266
ABOUT AT SCHOOL.

538
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,133
AND STATE STANDARDS VARY WIDELY.

539
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,567
WHEN CBS LOOKED INTO IT THIS

540
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:46,967
YEAR, IT FOUND "SEVEN STATES DO

541
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:48,533
NOT DIRECTLY MENTION SLAVERY IN

542
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,700
THEIR STATE STANDARDS," ONLY TWO

543
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:53,033
MENTION WHITE SUPREMACY, WHILE

544
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,734
16 LIST STATES' RIGHTS AS A

545
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,100
CAUSE OF THE CIVIL WAR.

546
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,734
AND WE ACTUALLY DID A WHOLE

547
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,333
21-MINUTE PIECE ABOUT WHAT'S

548
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,100
WRONG WITH THAT ARGUMENT, BUT

549
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:02,967
THIS CLIP EXPLAINS IT

550
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:04,033
SIGNIFICANTLY QUICKER.

551
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,500
THE ROOT OF THE CIVIL WAR IS

552
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,000
CLEAR.

553
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:06,633
WHAT CAUSED THE CIVIL WAR

554
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,467
WAS...

555
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:08,100
SLAVERY.

556
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:08,834
THE MAIN CAUSE AND WHY THE

557
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,567
SOUTH DECIDED TO SECEDE WAS...

558
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:12,233
SLAVERY.

559
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,066
SO, WHY DO OUR HISTORY

560
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:17,767
TEXTBOOKS GET IT SO WRONG?

561
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:18,667
Y'ALL DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH

562
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:19,300
THE UP THAT

563
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:19,834
Y'ALL ANCESTORS DID.

564
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,834
YEAH, THAT PRETTY MUCH

565
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,967
SUMS IT UP.

566
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:23,867
IT CAN BE HARD TO DEAL WITH WHAT

567
00:14:23,934 --> 00:14:25,333
YOUR ANCESTORS DID... TRUST ME,

568
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,834
I'M BRITISH.

569
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,834
ONE OF OUR MOST FAMOUS TOURIST

570
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,734
ATTRACTIONS IS A CASTLE WHERE WE

571
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,166
EXECUTED PEOPLE FOR CENTURIES

572
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:33,900
AND HAVE NOW FILLED WITH

573
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:34,700
STOLEN JEWELS, LIKE THE

574
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:36,000
KOH-I-NOOR DIAMOND... WHICH,

575
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:37,633
ACCORDING TO THE TOWER'S

576
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,033
WEBSITE, WAS "PRESENTED TO

577
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,533
QUEEN VICTORIA."

578
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,467
AND THAT VERB IS DOING A LOT OF

579
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:42,567
HEAVY LIFTING THERE.

580
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,400
IT WAS "PRESENTED" IN PRETTY

581
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:51,000
MUCH THE SAME WAY THAT INDIA

582
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:52,333
WAS, INSOMUCH AS IT WAS PRESENT

583
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,767
AND BRITAIN FUCKING TOOK IT.

584
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:55,767
AND FOR ALL THE CURRENT

585
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:56,333
HAND-WRINGING ABOUT HOW ANY

586
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:56,934
CHANGES WOULD POLITICIZE U.S.

587
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,567
HISTORY, IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING

588
00:14:57,633 --> 00:14:58,233
THAT THE TEACHING OF IT HAS

589
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:58,900
ALWAYS BEEN POLITICAL.

590
00:14:58,967 --> 00:14:59,867
AFTER THE CIVIL WAR, THE BATTLE

591
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:01,109
OVER HOW HISTORY WOULD BE TOLD

592
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,133
IN TEXTBOOKS WAS INTENSE.

593
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:02,700
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE SAYING

594
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:03,400
"HISTORY IS WRITTEN BY THE

595
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:04,934
WINNERS?

596
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,400
THE SOUTH SET OUT TO PROVE THAT

597
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:07,166
WRONG.

598
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:08,767
ONE ORGANIZATION, CALLED THE

599
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:09,633
UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE

600
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,710
CONFEDERACY, CAMPAIGNED FOR

601
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:12,100
SCHOOLS TO ADOPT TEXTBOOKS THAT

602
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,100
WOULD "ACCORD FULL JUSTICE TO

603
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,800
THE SOUTH," TELLING LIBRARIANS

604
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:18,033
TO WRITE "UNJUST TO THE SOUTH"

605
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,867
ON THE ONES THAT DIDN'T.

606
00:15:20,934 --> 00:15:22,033
WHICH IS CLEARLY ABSURD.

607
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,033
THAT'D BE LIKE A LIBRARIAN

608
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,276
WRITING "UNJUST TO VOLDEMORT" ON

609
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,467
"HARRY POTTERS" ONE THROUGH

610
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:27,900
SEVEN OR "UNJUST TO WHALE" ON

611
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:29,033
"MOBY DICK" OR "UNJUST TO

612
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,834
L. RON HUBBARD" ON LEAH REMINI'S

613
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,233
SURVIVING

614
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,433
HOLLYWOOD AND SCIENTOLOGY."

615
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,300
BUT THAT IMPULSE... TO DOWNPLAY

616
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:40,867
THE HORRORS OF SLAVERY... HAS

617
00:15:40,934 --> 00:15:41,667
MARKED HOW SCHOOLCHILDREN HAVE

618
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:44,033
LEARNED ABOUT IT EVER SINCE.

619
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,800
A GEORGIA TEXTBOOK FROM THE

620
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:45,667
'50s CLAIMED, "THE MASTER OFTEN

621
00:15:45,734 --> 00:15:46,467
HAD A BARBECUE OR A PICNIC FOR

622
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:47,533
HIS SLAVES.

623
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:48,834
THEN THEY HAD A GREAT FROLIC."

624
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,800
AND LOOK, EVERY EXCUSE FOR

625
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,300
SLAVERY IS SHITTY, BUT "WE GAVE

626
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:53,934
THEM SANDWICHES SOMETIMES" HAS

627
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,800
TO BE ONE OF THE SHITTIEST.

628
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:57,233
AND SOME WHO LEARNED HISTORY

629
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,533
FROM BOOKS LIKE THOSE COULDN'T

630
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,100
BELIEVE WHAT THEY WERE BEING

631
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,176
TOLD AT THE TIME... JUST WATCH

632
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,240
THIS ALABAMA SCHOOLTEACHER

633
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:04,834
REVISIT HER FOURTH-GRADE

634
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,834
TEXTBOOK, "KNOW ALABAMA":

635
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,767
"SOME SLAVES WERE GOOD

636
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,900
WORKERS AND VERY OBEDIENT.

637
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:15,734
MANY TOOK PRIDE IN WHAT THEY DID

638
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,233
AND LOVED THEIR CABINS AND THE

639
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,633
PLANTATION AS IF THEY ACTUALLY

640
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,467
OWNED THEM.

641
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:24,066
OTHERS WERE LAZY, DISOBEDIENT,

642
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:27,133
AND SOMETIMES VICIOUS."

643
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,343
I WONDER WHAT KIND OF SLAVE I

644
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:29,567
WOULD HAVE BEEN.

645
00:16:29,633 --> 00:16:30,900
I WONDER IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN

646
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:32,100
ONE OF THOSE LAZY SLAVES WHO

647
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,400
JUST WERE NOT WILLING TO WORK

648
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:36,367
FOR NOTHING OR DISOBEDIENT

649
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:38,066
BECAUSE I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO BE

650
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:39,000
A SLAVE.

651
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:40,166
YEAH.

652
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,433
THAT CONTEMPT IS FULLY MERITED

653
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,066
THERE.

654
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:44,567
BECAUSE AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE

655
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:46,367
IDEA THAT BEING A "LAZY" SLAVE

656
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:48,000
WAS A CHARACTER FLAW, AS OPPOSED

657
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:49,266
TO A FREQUENT ACT OF PROTEST

658
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,367
AGAINST A BRUTALLY UNJUST

659
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:53,066
SYSTEM, IS INFURIATING.

660
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:54,467
AND IT MAKES "KNOW ALABAMA"

661
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:55,653
SOUND LESS LIKE THE TITLE OF

662
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,567
THAT TEXTBOOK AND MORE LIKE

663
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:57,800
SOMETHING YOU'D YELL AT IT:

664
00:16:57,867 --> 00:16:58,667
"NO, ALABAMA!

665
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:00,066
STOP THAT!

666
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:01,200
BAD TEXTBOOK!

667
00:17:01,266 --> 00:17:02,734
NO!"

668
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,233
AND THOSE PASSAGES WERE IN THE

669
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,500
STANDARD ALABAMA HISTORY

670
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,333
TEXTBOOK INTO THE '70s.

671
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,609
SO PEOPLE WHO READ THEM AND MAY

672
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:10,667
HAVE BEEN SHAPED BY THEIR

673
00:17:10,734 --> 00:17:12,000
CONTENT ARE NOW IN THEIR 50s,

674
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:13,133
DOING THINGS LIKE RUNNING

675
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,567
BUSINESSES OR HOLDING ELECTED

676
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,433
OFFICE.

677
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,533
AND WHILE NEWER TEXTBOOKS MAY

678
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,767
NOT BE QUITE THAT EGREGIOUS,

679
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:21,633
THERE ARE STILL PROBLEMS.

680
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,743
EARLIER THIS YEAR, ONE HISTORIAN

681
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:23,843
FLAGGED A PRETTY REMARKABLE

682
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:24,987
EUPHEMISM IN A CURRENT TEXAS

683
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:29,193
THIS IS A PICTURE, AND THE

684
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:30,800
CAPTION SAYS, "SOME U.S.

685
00:17:30,867 --> 00:17:32,934
SETTLERS BROUGHT SLAVES TO TEXAS

686
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,233
TO HELP WORK THE FIELDS AND DO

687
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,467
CHORES."

688
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:39,800
AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T...

689
00:17:39,867 --> 00:17:40,633
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DESCRIBE

690
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,567
SLAVE LABOR AS CHORES.

691
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:44,433
YEAH, WE SHOULDN'T.

692
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,066
CALLING SLAVE LABOR "CHORES" IS

693
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:47,400
A EUPHEMISM ON PAR WITH CALLING

694
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,266
HITLER A "BEST-SELLING AUTHOR

695
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,767
WITH A SIDE HUSTLE," OR JFK'S

696
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:52,266
ASSASSINATION A "BAD HAIR DAY"

697
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,700
OR THIS "A COMEDY SHOW."

698
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:55,567
AND LOOK, STATE STANDARDS AND

699
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:56,567
TEXTBOOKS ARE JUST A BASELINE

700
00:17:56,633 --> 00:17:58,100
HERE.

701
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,800
WHAT HAPPENS IN A CLASSROOM

702
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:02,133
LARGELY DEPENDS ON TEACHERS, WHO

703
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,376
HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT JOB, OFTEN

704
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,133
WORKING WITH SCANT RESOURCES,

705
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
MEANING THAT, AMONG OTHER

706
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:06,506
THINGS, THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

707
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:07,400
GET UPDATED VERSIONS OF

708
00:18:07,467 --> 00:18:09,233
TEXTBOOKS.

709
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,567
AND SOME WORK TO CORRECT POOR

710
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:12,767
MATERIALS.

711
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:14,233
BUT OTHERS CAN ACTUALLY MAKE

712
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,867
THINGS EVEN WORSE, WITH

713
00:18:15,934 --> 00:18:17,233
TONE-DEAF ASSIGNMENTS AND

714
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,580
CLASSROOM EXERCISES THAT YOU MAY

715
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:20,200
BE FAMILIAR WITH FROM LOCAL NEWS

716
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,400
STORIES LIKE THESE:

717
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,507
THIS IS THE ACTIVITY IN

718
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,133
QUESTION.

719
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,633
IT ASKS STUDENTS TO CHOOSE TO BE

720
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,900
A SLAVE OR A SLAVE OWNER, AND

721
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:28,166
THEN TO WRITE A JOURNAL ENTRY

722
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,567
THAT DESCRIBES DAILY ACTIVITIES

723
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:31,100
BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR.

724
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,633
THE QUESTION ABOUT SLAVERY

725
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,533
READ, "YOU OWN A PLANTATION OR

726
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,609
FARM AND THEREFORE NEED MORE

727
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:37,300
WORKERS.

728
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,233
SET YOUR PRICE FOR A SLAVE.

729
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,000
THESE COULD BE WORTH A LOT.

730
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:44,200
THIS NORTH CAROLINA

731
00:18:44,266 --> 00:18:45,066
GRANDMOTHER COULDN'T BELIEVE

732
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:46,033
THE ASSIGNMENT GIVEN TO HER

733
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,600
FOURTH GRADER.

734
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,907
AND THEN THIS GAME IS CALLED

735
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:48,734
"ESCAPING SLAVERY."

736
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,834
A SLAVERY-THEMED

737
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,800
MONOPOLY-LIKE GAME STUDENTS

738
00:18:50,867 --> 00:18:56,166
PLAYED IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

739
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:56,967
CHILDREN WORKED IN SMALL GROUPS,

740
00:18:57,033 --> 00:18:58,367
GOT THIS "FREEDOM PUNCH CARD."

741
00:18:58,433 --> 00:18:59,066
IF THE GROUP RAN INTO TROUBLE,

742
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:00,467
THE CARD SAID THEY'D BE SEVERELY

743
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:01,867
PUNISHED AND SENT BACK TO THE

744
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:04,400
PLANTATION TO WORK AS A SLAVE.

745
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:06,066
WERE THEY GONNA HANG THEM?

746
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:07,734
WERE THEY GONNA KILL 'EM?

747
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,876
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU

748
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,767
DOING THERE?

749
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:11,767
YOU CAN'T REDUCE A PERSON'S

750
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:13,100
FREEDOM FROM SLAVERY DOWN TO

751
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,242
WHAT IS BASICALLY A JIMMY JOHN'S

752
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:15,600
PUNCH CARD.

753
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,166
AND JUST IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD

754
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:19,333
FEEL LIKE TO BE A BLACK KID IN

755
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,476
THAT CLASSROOM... OR, IF YOU

756
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,467
DON'T HAVE TO IMAGINE, REMEMBER.

757
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:26,700
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST THE

758
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:27,433
HISTORY THAT HURTS HERE, IT'S

759
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,233
HOW YOU'RE BEING MADE TO FEEL

760
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,033
WHILE YOU LEARN IT.

761
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,300
AND THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH

762
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:31,376
STORIES LIKE THOSE TEND TO CROP

763
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,266
UP MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH

764
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,443
THE FACT THAT THE OVERWHELMING

765
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:35,333
MAJORITY OF SCHOOL TEACHERS ARE

766
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,967
WHITE AND MANY MAY'VE GREW UP

767
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:39,734
LEARNING THE SAME SKEWED VERSION

768
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,700
OF HISTORY THAT THEY'RE NOW

769
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:41,934
PASSING ON.

770
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,934
AND WHEN YOU TAKE ALL THIS

771
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,266
TOGETHER, WE'RE GIVING KIDS

772
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,400
INCOMPLETE EDUCATIONS IN

773
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:46,509
HISTORY, WHILE ALSO DOING REAL

774
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:47,800
HARM.

775
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:49,333
BECAUSE THOSE KIDS GROW UP.

776
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,409
JUST LISTEN TO THIS GUY FROM

777
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:51,633
TULSA EXPLAINING HOW HE FELT

778
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,433
WHEN HE FINALLY FOUND OUT ABOUT

779
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,867
THAT 1921 MASSACRE WHERE HE

780
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:58,500
LIVED.

781
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:00,734
WHEN I WENT TO OU IN 1998, I

782
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,600
WAS SITTING IN A CLASS OF

783
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:03,467
AFRICAN-AMERICAN HISTORY.

784
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:05,934
AND THE PROFESSOR WAS TALKING

785
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:07,500
ABOUT THIS PLACE WHERE

786
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,840
BLACK PEOPLE HAD BUSINESSES AND

787
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:09,734
HAD MONEY AND HAD DOCTORS AND

788
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:10,867
LAWYERS.

789
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:12,867
AND HE SAID IT WAS IN TULSA.

790
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:15,667
AND I RAISED MY HAND, I SAID,

791
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:17,967
"NO, I'M FROM TULSA.

792
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:19,700
THAT'S NOT ACCURATE."

793
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:21,100
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS

794
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:21,900
MASSACRE, RIOT.

795
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:22,700
I SAID, "MAN, WHAT ARE YOU

796
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:23,767
TALKING ABOUT?"

797
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:24,700
I SAID, "I WENT TO SCHOOL ON

798
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:25,233
GREENWOOD.

799
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:30,734
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS EVER."

800
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,300
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

801
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:32,967
AND HIS SCHOOL REALLY LET

802
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:33,633
HIM DOWN THERE.

803
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,300
THINK OF THE EMOTIONAL WHIPLASH

804
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:34,934
THAT MAN WENT THROUGH.

805
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,700
HE FOUND OUT SOMETHING AMAZING

806
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:36,700
HAD ONCE EXISTED RIGHT WHERE HE

807
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:38,200
LIVED, SOMETHING HORRIBLE HAD

808
00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:39,133
TAKEN IT AWAY, AND THAT THE

809
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,500
HISTORY HAD BEEN KEPT FROM HIM.

810
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:45,800
AND ALL OF THIS HAD HAPPENED

811
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:46,433
LESS THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

812
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,509
THE DINOSAURS DIED 65 MILLION

813
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:48,433
YEARS AGO, AND YOU'D STILL BE

814
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,700
FLOORED IF SOMEONE ONLY JUST

815
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:51,000
TOLD YOU ABOUT THEM.

816
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,076
"I'M SORRY, THERE WERE WHAT?

817
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,533
WHERE?

818
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,233
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, 'EVERYWHERE'?

819
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,800
AND THEY WERE HOW BIG?

820
00:20:57,867 --> 00:20:58,400
SOME OF THEM COULD FLY?

821
00:20:58,467 --> 00:20:59,834
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?

822
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,633
OH, NO!

823
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,333
HOW THE FUCK IS THIS THE FIRST

824
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,333
TIME SOMEONE'S MENTIONING THIS

825
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,633
TO ME?"

826
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,810
LOOK, IT'S PRETTY CLEAR WE NEED

827
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:07,166
TO UPGRADE THE WAY WE TEACH OUR

828
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,233
HISTORY.

829
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:09,376
AND WHILE I OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE

830
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,800
TIME TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THAT

831
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:12,133
HISTORY RIGHT NOW, IT MIGHT BE

832
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,476
WORTH GOING SLOWLY THROUGH THREE

833
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,867
BIG MISTAKES THAT MANY

834
00:21:14,934 --> 00:21:16,166
HISTORIANS BELIEVE WE MAKE AND

835
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,834
SHOULD CORRECT IN SCHOOLS AND

836
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,900
BEYOND.

837
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:21,266
THE FIRST IS THAT WE DON'T FULLY

838
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,900
ACKNOWLEDGE THE HISTORY OF WHITE

839
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:24,400
SUPREMACY IN AMERICA, FROM ITS

840
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:26,033
FOUNDING TO THE PRESENT DAY.

841
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,309
AND I KNOW THAT ANYTIME SOMEONE

842
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,133
SUGGESTS TELLING CHILDREN

843
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,800
ANYTHING LESS THAN "JESUS WOULD

844
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:32,033
HAVE BEEN BEST FRIENDS WITH

845
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,433
ABRAHAM LINCOLN," THE PUSHBACK

846
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
IS FIERCE.

847
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:35,967
WATCH LAURA INGRAHAM TAKE ONE

848
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:37,176
SCHOOL BOARD'S DISCUSSION OF AN

849
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,533
ANTI-RACIST CURRICULUM AND SPIN

850
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,266
IT OUT INTO A DYSTOPIAN VISION

851
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,233
DESIGNED TO TERRIFY HER VIEWERS.

852
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,600
NOW, EVERY SUBJECT, EVERY

853
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:47,400
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITY WILL BE

854
00:21:47,467 --> 00:21:48,767
PERVERTED TO TURN YOUR KIDS INTO

855
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:49,934
MINI ILHAN OMARS.

856
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,800
THEY'RE GONNA LEARN THAT

857
00:21:52,867 --> 00:21:54,633
CAPITALISM IS RACIST, HISTORY AS

858
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,333
CONVENTIONALLY TAUGHT IS RACIST,

859
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,600
LITERATURE... MOST OF THAT'S

860
00:21:57,667 --> 00:21:59,100
RACIST... PATRIOTIC SONGS,

861
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:03,033
RACIST.

862
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,800
AND THE DECLARATION AND THE

863
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:04,600
CONSTITUTION, OF COURSE, THEY'RE

864
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:06,433
RACIST.

865
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,166
ARE YOU SENSING A THEME HERE?

866
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:08,400
NOW, LAURA INGRAHAM

867
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:09,300
MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE SOMEONE

868
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:10,834
CAPABLE OF FOLLOWING ANYTHING,

869
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,066
APART FROM BLACK TEENAGERS

870
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:15,834
SIMPLY TRYING TO SHOP AT CVS,

871
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,834
BUT I THINK SHE HAS

872
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,767
PICKED UP ON A THEME THERE,

873
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:18,667
BECAUSE, SEEING AS SHE BROUGHT

874
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:19,367
UP THE CONSTITUTION, LET'S TALK

875
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:20,367
ABOUT IT.

876
00:22:20,433 --> 00:22:21,600
THAT DOCUMENT IS A LOT OF

877
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:22,767
THINGS... GENUINELY

878
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:24,233
REVOLUTIONARY AND THE FOUNDATION

879
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,700
OF AN IMPROBABLY LONG-LIVED

880
00:22:25,767 --> 00:22:27,667
DEMOCRACY... BUT IT IS INFUSED

881
00:22:27,734 --> 00:22:29,200
WITH AND INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO

882
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:30,443
SLAVERY AND A LEGACY OF RACIAL

883
00:22:30,467 --> 00:22:31,867
INEQUALITY.

884
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,266
FROM THE THREE-FIFTHS CLAUSE

885
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,934
THROUGH THE FUGITIVE SLAVE

886
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,867
CLAUSE, THE CONSTITUTION BOTH

887
00:22:38,934 --> 00:22:39,600
CODIFIED SLAVERY AND MADE IT

888
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:40,467
HARDER FOR INDIVIDUALS TO ESCAPE

889
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:42,633
IT.

890
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:49,266
AND THE FACT THE CONSTITUTION

891
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:50,033
IS INFUSED WITH RACISM DOES NOT

892
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,467
MEAN IT'S CANCELED.

893
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:51,233
IT'S NOT A YOUTUBER WHO'S JUST

894
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:51,934
NOW REALIZING IT WAS WRONG TO DO

895
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,533
BLACKFACE FOR 14 YEARS.

896
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,300
AND IT DEFINITELY DOESN'T MEAN

897
00:22:53,367 --> 00:22:54,300
THAT KIDS SHOULDN'T LEARN ABOUT

898
00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:55,200
IT.

899
00:22:55,266 --> 00:22:56,276
BUT THEY SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO SEE

900
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,343
IT AS AN IMPERFECT DOCUMENT WITH

901
00:22:57,367 --> 00:22:58,600
IMPERFECT AUTHORS WHO BOTH

902
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:00,333
EXTOLLED THE IDEALS OF FREEDOM

903
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,867
FOR ALL WHILE AT THE SAME TIME

904
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:05,500
CODIFYING SLAVERY.

905
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:06,333
AND THAT IS POSSIBLE TO DO.

906
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,133
KIDS CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THINGS

907
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,533
CAN BE RACIST AND ALSO OTHER

908
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,867
THINGS.

909
00:23:09,934 --> 00:23:10,967
THE CONSTITUTION CAN BE

910
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:12,567
REVOLUTIONARY AND ALSO RACIST.

911
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:13,433
MOVIES CAN BE ROMANTIC AND ALSO

912
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,000
RACIST.

913
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:15,934
CHILDREN'S BOOKS CAN BE CHARMING

914
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,567
AND ALSO RACIST.

915
00:23:17,633 --> 00:23:19,633
BROADCASTERS CAN BE INCREDIBLY

916
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,066
SUCCESSFUL AND ALSO RACIST.

917
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:25,333
AND IF KIDS ARE TAUGHT AN

918
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,100
INCOMPLETE HISTORY, THEY EITHER

919
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:26,934
NEVER GET THE FULL STORY OR,

920
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,009
WHEN THEY DO, DON'T HAVE THE

921
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,273
FRAMEWORK TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE

922
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,233
PIECES FIT TOGETHER.

923
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,376
HERE'S ONE PROFESSOR, EXPLAINING

924
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,500
HOW HARD IT CAN BE FOR HIS

925
00:23:32,567 --> 00:23:33,609
STUDENTS LEARNING THE WHOLE

926
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:35,967
TRUTH ABOUT THOMAS JEFFERSON.

927
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:37,567
WHAT THAT CHILD IS THEN GONNA

928
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:39,533
DO IS SAY, "WAIT A MINUTE, WHY

929
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,934
DIDN'T I KNOW THIS BEFORE?

930
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,166
I'VE BEEN RUNNING AROUND HERE

931
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:45,467
SINGING THOMAS JEFFERSON'S

932
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:46,700
PRAISES AND I DIDN'T REALIZE

933
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:47,700
THAT HE'S THE R. KELLY OF HIS

934
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:48,700
TIME."

935
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:52,834
SO WHILE IT MAY BE

936
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,633
UNCOMFORTABLE, HE SAYS YOU HAVE

937
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,133
TO BE HONEST.

938
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,967
I SWEAR OHIOANS SUFFER FROM

939
00:23:56,033 --> 00:23:56,700
UNDERGROUND RAILROAD-ITIS,

940
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:57,467
RIGHT?

941
00:23:57,533 --> 00:23:58,266
OH, YEAH.

942
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,166
YOU ASK THEM, "WHO WOULD HAVE

943
00:23:59,233 --> 00:23:59,800
BEEN... WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR

944
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:00,633
THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD?"

945
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,734
RIGHT?

946
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,500
IN CLASS, EVERY, EVERY WHITE

947
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:04,033
HAND GOES... I MEAN, LOOK, IF

948
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,767
ALL Y'ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN DOWN

949
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:05,994
FOR THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD,

950
00:24:06,033 --> 00:24:06,667
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN

951
00:24:06,734 --> 00:24:07,400
UNDERGROUND, RIGHT?

952
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:08,200
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO NEED

953
00:24:08,266 --> 00:24:10,367
FOR IT.

954
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:11,367
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, IT

955
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:12,266
SAYS A LOT ABOUT JEFFERSON THAT,

956
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:13,667
IF YOU WENT BACK IN TIME,

957
00:24:13,734 --> 00:24:14,843
EXPLAINED TO HIM WHO R. KELLY

958
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:15,767
WAS, AND TOLD HIM HE WAS BEING

959
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:17,233
COMPARED TO HIM, THE CHILD

960
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,200
PORNOGRAPHY CHARGES WOULD NOT BE

961
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:19,734
THE NUMBER ONE REASON HE'D BE

962
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,000
INSULTED BY THE COMPARISON.

963
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:24,333
BUT THAT PROFESSOR MAKES A GOOD

964
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,633
POINT.

965
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,367
THE LESS YOU KNOW ABOUT HISTORY,

966
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:29,166
THE EASIER IT IS TO IMAGINE

967
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:30,100
YOU'D ALWAYS BE ON THE RIGHT

968
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:31,433
SIDE OF IT, BECAUSE THE TRUTH

969
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,609
IS, THE HISTORY OF AMERICA IS A

970
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:34,300
HISTORY OF CHANGING AN AMERICA

971
00:24:34,367 --> 00:24:35,834
THAT BADLY DOES NOT WANT TO BE

972
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:43,433
CHANGED.

973
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,100
THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS US TO THE

974
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:44,800
SECOND COMMON MISTAKE WE MAKE:

975
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:45,767
VIEWING AMERICAN HISTORY'S

976
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:46,567
PROGRESS AS IF IT WAS CONSTANTLY

977
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:47,500
AND INEVITABLY UPWARD.

978
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:48,734
TOO OFTEN, U.S. HISTORY IS

979
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,433
REDUCED DOWN TO, "THERE WAS

980
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,734
SLAVERY, THEN THERE WAS A

981
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,166
CIVIL WAR, THEN THERE WASN'T

982
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:54,734
SLAVERY ANYMORE, THEN THERE WAS

983
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,960
A CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, THEN

984
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,633
THERE WASN'T RACISM ANYMORE."

985
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,567
JUST A SMOOTH, STEADY UPWARD

986
00:24:57,633 --> 00:24:58,400
ARC.

987
00:24:58,467 --> 00:24:59,400
BUT THE MOMENTS ON EITHER SIDE

988
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:00,600
OF THOSE LANDMARK ERAS

989
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:01,710
COMPLICATE THE HELL OUT OF THAT

990
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:02,533
ARC, BECAUSE THEY WERE FILLED

991
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,400
WITH WHITE HOSTILITY AND UGLY

992
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:04,967
BACKSLIDING.

993
00:25:05,033 --> 00:25:06,133
TAKE THE CENTURY BETWEEN

994
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,000
THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR AND THE

995
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:09,500
CIVIL RIGHTS ACT, WHICH IS OFTEN

996
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:10,500
GLOSSED OVER BUT SHOULD PROBABLY

997
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:13,533
BE TAUGHT A LOT MORE THOROUGHLY.

998
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,066
IT BEGINS WITH RECONSTRUCTION, A

999
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:16,600
DOZEN OR SO YEARS OF REAL

1000
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:18,266
PROMISE, WHEN, VERY BASICALLY,

1001
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:19,700
THE SOUTH WAS FORCED TO REDRAW

1002
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:20,667
THEIR CONSTITUTIONS AND PERMIT

1003
00:25:20,734 --> 00:25:21,533
THE REGISTRATION OF BLACK

1004
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,333
VOTERS.

1005
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,200
THAT'S RIGHT, BLACK MEN

1006
00:25:25,266 --> 00:25:33,266
IN THE SOUTH WERE VOTING IN THE

1007
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,300
1860s AND 1870s.

1008
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:35,033
WHEN THEY FOUGHT FOR THE

1009
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,767
VOTING RIGHTS ACT IN THE 1960s,

1010
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:36,500
THEY WERE FIGHTING TO GET BACK

1011
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:37,200
SOMETHING THEY'D ALREADY HAD.

1012
00:25:37,266 --> 00:25:38,133
THE EFFECTS OF RECONSTRUCTION

1013
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,033
WERE ALMOST IMMEDIATE, WITH AN

1014
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:39,767
ESTIMATED 2,000 BLACK MEN

1015
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:40,567
SERVING IN ELECTIVE OFFICE

1016
00:25:40,633 --> 00:25:41,467
DURING THAT ERA, INCLUDING A

1017
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:42,533
NUMBER IN CONGRESS.

1018
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,633
AND JUST LOOK AT THESE GUYS.

1019
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,533
A-PLUS ACHIEVEMENT, A-PLUS-PLUS

1020
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,166
FACIAL HAIR.

1021
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:51,066
AND SURE, YOU THINK YOU CAN GROW

1022
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,734
YOUR MUSTACHE INTO YOUR BEARD...

1023
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,500
TRY IT, YOU FUCKING CAN'T.

1024
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:56,233
BUT IN RESPONSE TO THAT

1025
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:00,800
PROGRESS, WHITE PEOPLE PUSHED

1026
00:26:00,867 --> 00:26:01,934
BACK AND PUSHED BACK HARD.

1027
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,734
THE KKK WAS FOUNDED, 2,000 BLACK

1028
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,533
PEOPLE WERE LYNCHED, AND BY

1029
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,467
1877, THE SOUTH HAD REGAINED

1030
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:08,367
LOCAL CONTROL.

1031
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:09,673
HERE IS A CRAZY STORY YOU MIGHT

1032
00:26:10,467 --> 00:26:11,543
IN 1898, THE MULTI-RACIAL CITY

1033
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:12,934
GOVERNMENT IN WILMINGTON,

1034
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,333
NORTH CAROLINA, BECAME THE

1035
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,033
TARGET OF THE "ONLY COUP D'ETAT

1036
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,667
EVER TO TAKE PLACE ON AMERICAN

1037
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:19,233
SOIL," IN WHICH A MOB OF UP TO

1038
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,734
2,000 ARMED WHITE MEN KILLED AT

1039
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,300
LEAST 60 BLACK RESIDENTS AND

1040
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:23,867
REPLACED THE CITY'S ALDERMEN

1041
00:26:23,934 --> 00:26:26,900
WITH WHITE SUPREMACISTS.

1042
00:26:26,967 --> 00:26:28,467
AND IF THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

1043
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:30,767
YOU'RE LEARNING ABOUT THE ONLY

1044
00:26:30,834 --> 00:26:33,100
COUP ON AMERICAN SOIL, YOU'RE

1045
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:34,343
NOT ALONE, BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED

1046
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:35,447
THERE IS USUALLY EITHER NOT

1047
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,676
TAUGHT AT ALL, OR, AS THE AUTHOR

1048
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,033
OF A BOOK ON THAT MASSACRE

1049
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,109
POINTS OUT, TAUGHT VERY, VERY

1050
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:42,033
MISLEADINGLY.

1051
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:44,867
HERE'S FROM A 1949 TEXTBOOK

1052
00:26:44,934 --> 00:26:45,867
QUOTE, "A NUMBER OF BLACKS WERE

1053
00:26:45,934 --> 00:26:46,867
JAILED FOR STARTING A RIOT AND A

1054
00:26:46,934 --> 00:26:48,600
NEW WHITE ADMINISTRATION TOOK

1055
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:49,500
OVER WILMINGTON'S GOVERNMENT,"

1056
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:51,266
END QUOTE.

1057
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:55,667
YEAH.

1058
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:56,533
THAT'S IT.

1059
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,767
AND THAT IS NOT JUST DENYING

1060
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,300
WHAT HAPPENED... IT'S EVEN

1061
00:26:59,367 --> 00:26:59,633
WORSE.

1062
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,500
IT'S PLACING THE BLAME FOR IT ON

1063
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:01,133
THE VICTIMS.

1064
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,242
TECHNICALLY, YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN

1065
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:03,200
CALL IT A HISTORY BOOK SO MUCH

1066
00:27:03,266 --> 00:27:05,033
AS "A BOOK OF LIES BECAUSE WE

1067
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,734
KIND OF FELT A BIT WEIRD ABOUT

1068
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,333
THAT WHOLE VIOLENT RACIST COUP

1069
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,266
THING."

1070
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:09,033
AND WILMINGTON WASN'T EVEN THE

1071
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,000
MIDPOINT OF THAT CENTURY OF

1072
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:11,166
BACKSLIDING.

1073
00:27:11,233 --> 00:27:15,900
AND THE LAURA INGRAHAMS OF THE

1074
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,533
WORLD WILL PROBABLY SAY, YEAH,

1075
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,900
THAT'S ALL UGLY, BUT IN A SIGN

1076
00:27:18,967 --> 00:27:19,533
OF AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM, THE

1077
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,033
CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT

1078
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,834
ENDED ALL OF THAT WHEN

1079
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,567
MARTIN LUTHER KING'S DREAM CAME

1080
00:27:21,633 --> 00:27:22,734
TRUE.

1081
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,810
AND THAT IS THE VERSION THAT

1082
00:27:23,834 --> 00:27:24,876
MOST AMERICANS ARE TAUGHT IN

1083
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,900
SCHOOL.

1084
00:27:25,934 --> 00:27:27,133
BUT IT LEAVES A LOT OUT.

1085
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,834
IN FACT, TAKE THE MARCH ON

1086
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,667
WASHINGTON.

1087
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:32,266
THAT WASN'T ACTUALLY ITS FULL

1088
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:32,834
NAME.

1089
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,600
IT WAS CALLED THE

1090
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:34,533
"MARCH ON WASHINGTON

1091
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,533
FOR JOBS AND FREEDOM," AND THE

1092
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,300
ECONOMIC JUSTICE PART OF IT WAS

1093
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:37,667
FRONT AND CENTER.

1094
00:27:37,734 --> 00:27:38,867
KING ACTUALLY GREW MORE

1095
00:27:38,934 --> 00:27:39,943
OUTSPOKEN ABOUT THAT ISSUE IN

1096
00:27:39,967 --> 00:27:41,000
THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED.

1097
00:27:41,066 --> 00:27:42,467
AND KING HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD WHY

1098
00:27:42,533 --> 00:27:43,900
IT WAS HARDER TO MAKE PROGRESS

1099
00:27:43,967 --> 00:27:46,166
ON THAT FRONT.

1100
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:48,066
IT DIDN'T COST THE NATION ONE

1101
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,133
PENNY TO INTEGRATE LUNCH

1102
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:52,033
COUNTERS.

1103
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,934
IT DIDN'T COST THE NATION ONE

1104
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,109
PENNY TO GUARANTEE THE RIGHT TO

1105
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:59,200
VOTE.

1106
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:02,300
NOW WE ARE DEALING WITH ISSUES

1107
00:28:02,367 --> 00:28:03,800
THAT CANNOT BE SOLVED WITHOUT

1108
00:28:03,867 --> 00:28:06,500
THE NATION SPENDING BILLIONS OF

1109
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:08,066
DOLLARS AND UNDERGOING A RADICAL

1110
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:09,333
REDISTRIBUTION OF ECONOMIC

1111
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,300
POWER.

1112
00:28:11,367 --> 00:28:12,266
YEAH, IT TURNS OUT THAT

1113
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:13,343
MARTIN LUTHER KING HAD MORE THAN

1114
00:28:13,367 --> 00:28:20,066
ONE DREAM.

1115
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:22,033
AND ONE OF THEM WAS ABOUT WEALTH

1116
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:22,400
REDISTRIBUTION.

1117
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:22,967
SO WHILE I KNOW IT'S EASY TO

1118
00:28:23,033 --> 00:28:23,600
DISTORT KING'S FULL LEGACY DOWN

1119
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:24,166
TO THAT ONE SOARING SPEECH,

1120
00:28:24,233 --> 00:28:25,133
POINT TO THE CAST OF

1121
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,000
"THIS IS US," AND SAY, "SEE?

1122
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:29,600
WE DID IT, EVERYONE.

1123
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:30,166
EVERYTHING IS FIXED NOW."

1124
00:28:30,233 --> 00:28:31,309
THE TRUTH IS, THE CIVIL RIGHTS

1125
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:31,867
MOVEMENT WAS LONGER, MESSIER,

1126
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:32,867
MORE RADICAL, AND, CRUCIALLY,

1127
00:28:32,934 --> 00:28:34,009
WAS THWARTED IN MORE OF ITS AIMS

1128
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:35,142
THAN MANY OF US WERE TAUGHT IN

1129
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:37,400
SCHOOL.

1130
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:38,934
AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE FINAL

1131
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,867
POINT, WHICH IS THAT WE DON'T

1132
00:28:39,934 --> 00:28:41,266
CONNECT THE DOTS TO THE PRESENT.

1133
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:42,266
AND THOSE DOTS ARE VERY MUCH

1134
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:44,867
THERE.

1135
00:28:44,934 --> 00:28:45,567
LOOK AT THE BLACK-WHITE WAGE AND

1136
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:47,100
WEALTH GAPS.

1137
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:48,286
THEY'RE BOTH LARGER NOW THAN

1138
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:49,443
THEY WERE WHEN KING GAVE THAT

1139
00:28:49,467 --> 00:28:50,467
SPEECH.

1140
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,967
AND OUR HOUSING AND EDUCATION

1141
00:28:52,033 --> 00:28:53,300
SYSTEMS, EVEN IN LIBERAL CITIES

1142
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,767
LIKE NEW YORK AND L.A., ARE

1143
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,867
STILL SHAMEFULLY SEGREGATED.

1144
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:57,943
AND IF YOU DON'T TEACH HISTORY

1145
00:28:57,967 --> 00:29:00,066
PROPERLY, ALL YOU SEE IS THOSE

1146
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:02,000
EFFECTS AND NOT THE CAUSES, WHEN

1147
00:29:02,066 --> 00:29:03,233
THE TRUTH IS, YOU CAN DRAW A

1148
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,567
STRAIGHT LINE FROM THE

1149
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:06,667
POST-CIVIL WAR RETURN OF

1150
00:29:06,734 --> 00:29:10,500
PLANTATION LAND TO ITS FORMER

1151
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:11,300
CONFEDERATES THROUGH THE

1152
00:29:11,367 --> 00:29:11,967
MASSIVE TRANSFERS OF LAND

1153
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:12,834
THROUGH THE HOMESTEAD ACT...

1154
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,700
MOSTLY TO WHITE INDIVIDUALS...

1155
00:29:13,767 --> 00:29:14,934
THROUGH THE GROWTH OF THE

1156
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,133
SUBURBS IN THE 20TH CENTURY,

1157
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,367
WHERE RED-LINING KEPT BLACK

1158
00:29:17,433 --> 00:29:18,233
PEOPLE FROM MOVING INTO WHITE

1159
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,500
NEIGHBORHOODS THROUGHOUT THE

1160
00:29:19,567 --> 00:29:22,567
COUNTRY.

1161
00:29:22,633 --> 00:29:24,333
IN FACT, JUST LISTEN TO THIS

1162
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,000
WOMAN IN LEVITTOWN,

1163
00:29:25,066 --> 00:29:25,667
PENNSYLVANIA, EXPLAIN

1164
00:29:25,734 --> 00:29:26,876
HER OBJECTIONS TO A BLACK FAMILY

1165
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,767
MOVING TO TOWN IN 1957 WITH SOME

1166
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:30,734
REAL HONESTY.

1167
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,633
WE LIKED THE ADVANTAGES THAT

1168
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,133
LEVITTOWN SEEMED TO OFFER IN

1169
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,033
COMPARISON TO OTHER CITIES.

1170
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,433
AND WE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS

1171
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,367
GOING TO BE ALL WHITE AND WE

1172
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:38,967
WERE VERY HAPPY TO BUY A HOME

1173
00:29:39,033 --> 00:29:39,900
HERE.

1174
00:29:39,967 --> 00:29:41,266
DO YOU THINK A NEGRO FAMILY

1175
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:42,200
MOVING HERE WILL AFFECT THE

1176
00:29:42,266 --> 00:29:44,567
COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE?

1177
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:46,367
DEFINITELY.

1178
00:29:46,433 --> 00:29:48,734
THE WHOLE TROUBLE WITH THIS

1179
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,900
INTEGRATION BUSINESS IS THAT, IN

1180
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:51,976
THE END, IT PROBABLY WILL END UP

1181
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,033
WITH... WITH MIXING SOCIALLY.

1182
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,934
AND YOU WILL HAVE... WELL, I

1183
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,200
THINK THEIR AIM IS MIXED

1184
00:29:57,266 --> 00:29:59,734
MARRIAGES AND BECOMING EQUAL

1185
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,400
WITH THE WHITES.

1186
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:04,500
WOW.

1187
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:05,266
IT IS ALWAYS WEIRD TO HEAR

1188
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:05,967
SOMEONE... WHETHER OR NOT THEY

1189
00:30:06,033 --> 00:30:06,767
LOOK LIKE SUMMER CASUAL

1190
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:07,900
BETTY CROCKER... FRAME

1191
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:08,976
"HUMAN BEINGS BEING TREATED

1192
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,033
EQUALLY" AS A NEGATIVE.

1193
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,300
IT'S LIKE HEARING SOMEONE SAY

1194
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:13,509
"THE WHOLE TROUBLE WITH PUTTING

1195
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:14,467
GRAHAM CRACKERS, CHOCOLATE BARS,

1196
00:30:14,533 --> 00:30:15,653
AND MARSHMALLOWS TOGETHER IS

1197
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,633
THAT WE MIGHT END UP WITH

1198
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,100
S'MORES."

1199
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:23,066
YEAH, EXACTLY.

1200
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:25,100
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

1201
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:26,967
ONLY A FUCKING MONSTER WOULDN'T

1202
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:27,467
WANT THAT.

1203
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:28,233
AND IT MIGHT NOT SURPRISE YOU TO

1204
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,000
SEE THAT SOMEONE WAS INCREDIBLY

1205
00:30:31,066 --> 00:30:31,567
RACIST IN THE 1950s.

1206
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:32,367
BUT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE

1207
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:33,133
WAY WE TEACH HISTORY IS THAT,

1208
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,133
TOO OFTEN, IT SORT OF TRAILS OFF

1209
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,443
AFTER THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.

1210
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:36,266
AND WHEN YOU SKIP OVER THE PAST

1211
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:38,433
HALF-CENTURY OF HISTORY, YOU

1212
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,400
DON'T GET TO SEE THE PROCESS BY

1213
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:40,734
WHICH WHITE SUPREMACY, INSTEAD

1214
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,166
OF DISAPPEARING, MERELY ADAPTED.

1215
00:30:45,233 --> 00:30:47,367
AND PERHAPS NOBODY MADE THAT

1216
00:30:47,433 --> 00:30:48,100
PROCESS CLEARER THAN

1217
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:48,600
LEE ATWATER, A TOP

1218
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:49,533
REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST

1219
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,233
WHO WORKED FOR, AMONG OTHERS,

1220
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,066
RONALD REAGAN AND

1221
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:52,767
GEORGE H.W. BUSH.

1222
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:55,400
HERE HE IS SPELLING OUT THE

1223
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:56,609
WHOLE GAME IN 1981... AND I'M

1224
00:30:56,633 --> 00:30:58,300
GOING TO WARN YOU, YOU'RE ABOUT

1225
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:00,200
TO HEAR THE N-WORD A LOT.

1226
00:31:00,266 --> 00:31:02,000
YOU START OUT IN 1954 BY

1227
00:31:02,066 --> 00:31:02,767
SAYING, "NIGGER, NIGGER,

1228
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:03,967
NIGGER."

1229
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:05,400
BY 1968, YOU CAN'T SAY

1230
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:06,166
"NIGGER"... THAT HURTS YOU,

1231
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:07,667
BACKFIRES.

1232
00:31:07,734 --> 00:31:09,734
SO YOU SAY STUFF LIKE, UH,

1233
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,033
"FORCED BUSING," "STATES'

1234
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,834
RIGHTS," AND ALL THAT STUFF, AND

1235
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,900
YOU'RE GETTING SO ABSTRACT.

1236
00:31:14,967 --> 00:31:17,300
NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CUTTING

1237
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:18,266
TAXES, AND ALL THESE THINGS

1238
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:19,509
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE TOTALLY

1239
00:31:19,533 --> 00:31:21,433
ECONOMIC THINGS, AND A BYPRODUCT

1240
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,734
OF THEM IS, BLACKS GET HURT

1241
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,133
WORSE THAN WHITES.

1242
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,500
"WE WANT TO CUT THIS" IS MUCH

1243
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:29,900
MORE ABSTRACT THAN EVEN THE

1244
00:31:29,967 --> 00:31:31,934
BUSING THING, UH, AND A HELL OF

1245
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,433
A LOT MORE ABSTRACT THAN

1246
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,600
"NIGGER, NIGGER."

1247
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:39,467
HOLY SHIT.

1248
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:40,467
OBVIOUSLY, HE'S A LITTLE TOO

1249
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:41,300
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT WORD.

1250
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:42,600
YOU TEND TO ONLY HEAR IT COME

1251
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,166
OUT THAT SMOOTHLY IN EITHER

1252
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:44,967
TARANTINO MOVIES OR ONLINE

1253
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:46,076
FORUMS IN WHICH WHITE CHILDREN

1254
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,900
PLAY VIDEO GAMES TOGETHER.

1255
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:51,076
BUT THAT IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY

1256
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,600
CONCISE HISTORY OF A CERTAIN

1257
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:52,233
THREAD IN POLITICS FOR THE PAST

1258
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,066
HALF-CENTURY, WHICH BRINGS US

1259
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:55,400
ALL THE WAY UP TO THE PRESENT

1260
00:31:55,467 --> 00:31:57,066
DAY... LITERALLY, THE PRESENT

1261
00:31:57,133 --> 00:31:59,734
WEDNESDAY, WHICH IS WHEN THE

1262
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,009
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

1263
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:05,600
IN ANNOUNCING A ROLLBACK OF

1264
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:06,333
AN OBAMA-ERA RULE UNDER THE

1265
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,233
FAIR HOUSING ACT, SENT A TWEET

1266
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,033
IN WHICH HE INFORMED ALL OF THE

1267
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,767
PEOPLE LIVING THEIR SUBURBAN

1268
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:09,767
LIFESTYLE DREAM THAT THEY WILL

1269
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:10,834
NO LONGER BE BOTHERED OR

1270
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,800
FINANCIALLY HURT BY HAVING

1271
00:32:11,867 --> 00:32:12,967
LOW-INCOME HOUSING BUILT IN

1272
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:17,433
THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS.

1273
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,743
AND THAT IS BASICALLY A CAMPAIGN

1274
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:19,843
PROMISE CRAFTED BY LEE ATWATER

1275
00:32:19,867 --> 00:32:20,976
AND DESIGNED TO WIN OVER THIS

1276
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
WOMAN WHO'S PROBABLY DEAD NOW.

1277
00:32:24,066 --> 00:32:25,433
AND WHAT'S NOTABLE THERE IS NOT

1278
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,367
THAT TRUMP'S BEING RACIST...

1279
00:32:26,433 --> 00:32:27,300
WHICH IS NOT REMOTELY

1280
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:29,133
SURPRISING.

1281
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,734
IT'S HOW NEATLY HE FITS INTO A

1282
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,934
SYSTEMIC RACISM THAT'S BEEN

1283
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,142
BAKED INTO THIS COUNTRY FROM THE

1284
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:34,867
BEGINNING AND WHICH WILL STILL

1285
00:32:34,934 --> 00:32:36,934
BE HERE WHEN HE IS GONE.

1286
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,734
AND IF KIDS AREN'T TAUGHT THIS,

1287
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,967
WHAT CHANCE DO THEY HAVE TO

1288
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:41,109
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING

1289
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:42,400
RIGHT NOW?

1290
00:32:42,467 --> 00:32:43,667
AND OBVIOUSLY, YOU'D NEED TO

1291
00:32:43,734 --> 00:32:44,800
CALIBRATE THIS TO EACH AGE

1292
00:32:44,867 --> 00:32:48,767
GROUP.

1293
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,367
NO ONE IS SUGGESTING PLAYING

1294
00:32:50,433 --> 00:32:50,900
THAT LEE ATWATER TAPE TO

1295
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:51,633
THIRD-GRADERS.

1296
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,533
YOU

1297
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,734
DON'T SKIP STRAIGHT AHEAD TO

1298
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:58,900
EJACULATION... WHICH, BY THE

1299
00:32:58,967 --> 00:33:00,367
WAY, IS A PRETTY GOOD SEX TIP

1300
00:33:00,433 --> 00:33:01,633
FOR ANYONE WITH A PENIS... BUT

1301
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,233
WE ALSO DON'T SPEND THE FIRST

1302
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,100
SEMESTER OF SEX ED TEACHING KIDS

1303
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:03,867
THAT WE WERE ALL DROPPED OUT OF

1304
00:33:03,934 --> 00:33:04,974
THE SKY BY FUCKING STORKS,

1305
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:05,567
BECAUSE THEY'LL LATER HAVE TO

1306
00:33:05,633 --> 00:33:07,533
UN-LEARN THAT.

1307
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,834
AND I KNOW THAT ADDRESSING

1308
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,100
MISTAKES LIKE THESE WON'T BE

1309
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:11,500
EASY.

1310
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:12,727
THERE'LL BE BAD-FAITH CHARGES

1311
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:14,233
THAT DOING SO IS POLITICAL...

1312
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,467
ALTHOUGH, I'D ARGUE, NO MORE

1313
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:16,467
POLITICAL THAN THE CHOICES WE'VE

1314
00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:18,066
MADE TO TEACH HISTORY THE WAY WE

1315
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:21,500
DO NOW.

1316
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:22,500
AND NO DOUBT SOME PARENTS

1317
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:23,400
WILL INSTINCTIVELY RESIST THIS.

1318
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:24,767
BACK IN 2010, WHEN TEXAS WAS

1319
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:26,767
REVIEWING ITS STATE STANDARDS,

1320
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:27,994
ONE PARENT MADE IT VERY CLEAR

1321
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:29,400
THAT THE MAIN HISTORY HE WANTED

1322
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:31,767
HIS KIDS TAUGHT WAS THAT OF

1323
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:33,600
"AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM."

1324
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:37,467
THE ONE THING I WANT MY KIDS

1325
00:33:37,533 --> 00:33:38,834
TO KNOW WHEN... WHEN THEY

1326
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,767
GET OUT OF SCHOOL ABOUT AMERICA

1327
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:42,033
IS THAT THE WORST DAY IN AMERICA

1328
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,142
BEATS THE BEST DAY IN ANY OTHER

1329
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:46,734
COUNTRY.

1330
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,834
THAT FEELS...

1331
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:50,500
THAT FEELS PRETTY EASY.

1332
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:51,900
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE BECOMES THIS

1333
00:33:51,967 --> 00:33:53,667
GREAT FOCUS ON THE NEGATIVE

1334
00:33:53,734 --> 00:33:55,633
HISTORY OF AMERICA INSTEAD OF

1335
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,467
SAYING... OH, TAKE, FOR

1336
00:33:57,533 --> 00:33:58,813
INSTANCE, SLAVERY... INSTEAD OF,

1337
00:33:58,867 --> 00:33:59,800
YOU KNOW, LOOKING AT IT IN A

1338
00:33:59,867 --> 00:34:01,066
POSITIVE LIGHT THAT AMERICANS

1339
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:02,867
OVERCAME SOMETHING AS EVIL AS

1340
00:34:02,934 --> 00:34:05,767
SLAVERY AND THAT WE'RE STILL A

1341
00:34:05,834 --> 00:34:07,633
GREAT NATION TODAY SHOULD BE A

1342
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,834
TESTAMENT TO THE KIND OF

1343
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,767
AMERICAN SPIRIT THAT EXISTS IN

1344
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:13,166
THIS COUNTRY.

1345
00:34:13,233 --> 00:34:14,834
OKAY, SO THERE'S A LOT

1346
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,600
TO UNPACK THERE.

1347
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:18,400
FIRST, YOUR WORST DAY IN AMERICA

1348
00:34:18,467 --> 00:34:19,800
REALLY DEPENDS ON WHO YOU ARE,

1349
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:21,107
AND, IMPORTANTLY, WHEN YOU ARE.

1350
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:22,242
THERE'S A REASON, FOR INSTANCE,

1351
00:34:22,266 --> 00:34:23,266
MARTY McFLY WAS WHITE.

1352
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:25,133
BECAUSE BLACK PEOPLE DON'T

1353
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,567
GENERALLY HANG AROUND WITH

1354
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:29,433
JOHN C. CALHOUN LOOKALIKES WHO

1355
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,710
ARE OBSESSED WITH GOING BACK TO

1356
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:31,633
THE 1950s.

1357
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,033
AND SECOND, "AMERICANS" DID NOT

1358
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,633
OVERCOME SLAVERY.

1359
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,633
"CERTAIN" AMERICANS OVERCAME

1360
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,367
CERTAIN "OTHER" AMERICANS, AND

1361
00:34:36,433 --> 00:34:37,710
SLAVERY WAS "ENDED," BUT WHETHER

1362
00:34:37,734 --> 00:34:38,934
IT WAS "OVERCOME" IS VERY MUCH

1363
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:43,333
ANOTHER MATTER.

1364
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,667
AND, LOOK, WHILE I UNDERSTAND

1365
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:45,934
ANY PARENT WANTING HIS KIDS TO

1366
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:47,266
BE TAUGHT SOMETHING INSPIRING,

1367
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:47,900
WHAT HE'S ESSENTIALLY ASKING FOR

1368
00:34:47,967 --> 00:34:48,467
THERE IS FOR HIS KIDS TO BE

1369
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:49,066
MISINFORMED.

1370
00:34:49,133 --> 00:34:49,667
AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO SERVE

1371
00:34:49,734 --> 00:34:50,600
THEM WELL WHEN THEY GROW UP.

1372
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:51,333
IT'S NOT GOING TO SERVE ANY OF

1373
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,400
US WELL.

1374
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:53,543
BECAUSE IGNORING THE HISTORY YOU

1375
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:54,867
DON'T LIKE IS NOT A VICTIMLESS

1376
00:34:54,934 --> 00:34:56,100
ACT.

1377
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:57,567
AND A HISTORY OF AMERICA THAT

1378
00:34:57,633 --> 00:34:59,734
IGNORES WHITE SUPREMACY IS A

1379
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,400
WHITE SUPREMACIST'S HISTORY OF

1380
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:03,000
AMERICA, WHICH MATTERS, BECAUSE,

1381
00:35:03,066 --> 00:35:04,767
WHILE IT MIGHT SEEM OBVIOUS,

1382
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:06,200
HISTORY ISN'T OVER... IT'S STILL

1383
00:35:06,266 --> 00:35:07,100
BEING WRITTEN.

1384
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:07,834
AND YOU KNOW WHO UNDERSTOOD

1385
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,900
THAT?

1386
00:35:08,934 --> 00:35:15,834
JOHN LEWIS.

1387
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,133
HE IS SOMEONE WHO'S VERY MUCH

1388
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,133
PART OF AMERICAN HISTORY, AND HE

1389
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,500
KNEW THE IMPORTANCE OF DRAWING A

1390
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:20,100
LINE FROM THE PAST THROUGH THE

1391
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:20,600
PRESENT.

1392
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:21,233
THAT MAY BE WHY ONE OF THE LAST

1393
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,033
THINGS HE DID BEFORE HE DIED WAS

1394
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,633
VISIT BLACK LIVES MATTER PLAZA

1395
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,467
IN WASHINGTON.

1396
00:35:23,533 --> 00:35:24,576
HE EVEN WROTE AN OP-ED TO BE

1397
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,467
PUBLISHED POSTHUMOUSLY, WHICH

1398
00:35:25,533 --> 00:35:26,967
SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO WHAT WE'VE

1399
00:35:27,033 --> 00:35:28,767
BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

1400
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:29,400
JUST LISTEN TO THIS EXTRACT,

1401
00:35:29,467 --> 00:35:31,500
READ BY MORGAN FREEMAN:

1402
00:35:31,567 --> 00:35:32,934
YOU MUST ALSO STUDY AND LEARN

1403
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,700
THE LESSONS OF HISTORY BECAUSE

1404
00:35:34,767 --> 00:35:36,266
HUMANITY HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN

1405
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,767
THIS SOUL-WRENCHING, EXISTENTIAL

1406
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:41,100
STRUGGLE FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

1407
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:42,867
PEOPLE ON EVERY CONTINENT HAVE

1408
00:35:42,934 --> 00:35:44,700
STOOD IN YOUR SHOES, THROUGH

1409
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,887
DECADES AND CENTURIES BEFORE

1410
00:35:45,934 --> 00:35:48,467
YOU.

1411
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:51,166
THE TRUTH DOES NOT CHANGE, AND

1412
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:52,800
THAT IS WHY THE ANSWERS WORKED

1413
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:54,067
OUT LONG AGO CAN HELP YOU FIND

1414
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,734
SOLUTIONS TO THE CHALLENGES OF

1415
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,100
OUR TIME.

1416
00:35:58,166 --> 00:35:59,734
EXACTLY.

1417
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,080
HISTORY, WHEN TAUGHT WELL, SHOWS

1418
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:02,467
US HOW TO IMPROVE THE WORLD.

1419
00:36:02,533 --> 00:36:03,710
BUT HISTORY, WHEN TAUGHT POORLY,

1420
00:36:03,734 --> 00:36:05,300
FALSELY CLAIMS THERE'S NOTHING

1421
00:36:05,367 --> 00:36:07,166
TO IMPROVE.

1422
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:09,066
SO WE HAVE TO TEACH IT BETTER

1423
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,066
AND CONTINUE TO LEARN IT,

1424
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:11,333
BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL

1425
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,000
OF US TO LISTEN TO THE VOICES OF

1426
00:36:13,066 --> 00:36:16,867
HISTORY, WHETHER THEY ARE A CALL

1427
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:17,976
TO ACTION, TRULY HORRIFIC, OR A

1428
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
SAD MUMMY ORGASM.

1429
00:36:19,066 --> 00:36:21,000
EH.

1430
00:36:21,066 --> 00:36:22,066
STILL EXCELLENT.

1431
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,967
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

1432
00:36:23,033 --> 00:36:26,567
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

1433
00:36:26,633 --> 00:36:27,166
WE'RE OFF NEXT WEEK, BACK

1434
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:30,867
AUGUST 16TH.

1435
00:36:30,934 --> 00:36:32,667
HI, STEVE GUTTENBERG AGAIN.

1436
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:34,066
WANT TO GIVE YOU A FEW THINGS

1437
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:34,700
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GOOGLE TO FILL

1438
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:37,433
IN THOSE GAPS.

1439
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,000
CLAUDETTE COLEMAN, SHE'S

1440
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:39,667
AMAZING.

1441
00:36:39,734 --> 00:36:41,900
THERE'S A WHOLE HISTORY THERE.

1442
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:43,500
JAMES BALDWIN.

1443
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:44,266
THERE'S A GREAT DOCUMENTARY.

1444
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:47,767
THE RED SUMMER OF 1919.

1445
00:36:47,834 --> 00:36:49,867
DAVID WALKER'S APPEAL.

1446
00:36:49,934 --> 00:36:50,934
THE BROWNSVILLE AFFAIR.

1447
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,300
THE ATLANTA WASHER WOMEN STRIKE.

1448
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:54,033
JUST GOOGLE THEM ALL.

1449
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,100
THAT WILL BE 150 BOOKS.

1450
