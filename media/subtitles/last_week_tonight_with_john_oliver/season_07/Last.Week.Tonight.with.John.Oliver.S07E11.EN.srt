1
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:27,033
John: HELLO THERE, AND

2
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,533
WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

3
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,066
TAKING PLACE INSIDE THIS VOID,

4
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:31,142
WHICH I'VE ACTUALLY NICKNAMED

5
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:31,967
"MOMMY."

6
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:35,867
WHY HAVE I DONE THAT?

7
00:00:35,934 --> 00:00:37,233
WELL, BECAUSE IT'S WHITE,

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,500
CHILLY, AND WANTS ME OUT OF IT

9
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:39,233
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,133
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY, EVERYONE!

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,433
NOW, OBVIOUSLY, MANY OF US ARE

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:41,934
STILL WORKING FROM HOME.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,567
EVEN THE SUPREME COURT IS

14
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:43,300
HEARING ARGUMENTS REMOTELY.

15
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:44,543
AND THIS WEEK, IT SEEMS THEY HAD

16
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:45,767
A LITTLE MISHAP.

17
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:47,500
WHAT THE FTC HAS SAID IS THAT

18
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:48,567
WHEN...

19
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:50,400
THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE

20
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,576
CALL RANGES TO THE TOPIC, THEN

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,367
THE CALL IS TRANSFORMED.

22
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:54,734
John: YEAH, SOMEONE

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,876
APPARENTLY FLUSHED A TOILET

24
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,300
DURING THE ORAL ARGUMENTS.

25
00:00:57,367 --> 00:01:02,033
AND LOOK, I GET WORKING FROM

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,667
HOME IS A BIT OF AN ADJUSTMENT,

27
00:01:03,734 --> 00:01:04,300
BUT THERE'S SIMPLY NO EXCUSE FOR

28
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:05,407
THAT LEVEL OF UNPROFESS...

29
00:01:05,467 --> 00:01:06,100
GODDAMNIT!

30
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:06,900
NOT NOW!

31
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:07,900
DADDY'S FILMING THE SHOW!

32
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:08,867
NO POOPING ON SHOW DAYS!

33
00:01:08,934 --> 00:01:10,133
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS:

34
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
WE ONLY POOP ON TUESDAYS.

35
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:12,767
THAT IS IT.

36
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:15,266
TUESDAYS, WE POOP ALL DAY.

37
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,166
ON FRIDAYS, WE ALL DRAW CARDS,

38
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:17,000
AND IF YOU PULL THE ACE OF

39
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:18,109
SPADES, YOU CAN DO A BONUS POOP.

40
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:18,700
BUT WE DO!

41
00:01:18,767 --> 00:01:19,333
NOT!

42
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,000
POOP!

43
00:01:20,066 --> 00:01:20,734
ON!

44
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,500
SHOW DAYS!

45
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:23,533
EVER!

46
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,433
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

47
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,743
IT WAS ANOTHER BUSY WEEK FOR THE

48
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:27,600
WHITE HOUSE, ALTHOUGH

49
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:29,166
REFRESHINGLY, ONE OF THE BIGGEST

50
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:30,409
PIECES OF NEWS WAS NOT ACTUALLY

51
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:32,400
CORONAVIRUS RELATED:

52
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,633
29 MONTHS AFTER LEAVING THIS

53
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,967
COURTHOUSE IN SHAME FOLLOWING

54
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:38,100
PLEADING GUILTY TO LYING TO THE

55
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,200
FBI, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT

56
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,767
CONVICTED MICHAEL FLYNN NOW

57
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:43,009
SEEKING TO THROW OUT THE CASE.

58
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:44,076
A CRIME CANNOT BE ESTABLISHED

59
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,367
HERE.

60
00:01:45,433 --> 00:01:47,734
THEY DID NOT HAVE A BASIS FOR A

61
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,100
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

62
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,343
INVESTIGATION AGAINST FLYNN AT

63
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:51,700
THAT STAGE.

64
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:52,533
DOES THE FACT REMAIN THAT HE

65
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,633
LIED?

66
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,867
WELL, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE

67
00:01:54,934 --> 00:01:56,400
SOMETIMES PLEAD TO THINGS THAT

68
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:58,800
TURN OUT NOT TO BE CRIMES.

69
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:01,433
John: YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

70
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,620
SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO PLEAD TO

71
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:03,743
THINGS THAT TURN OUT NOT TO BE

72
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:05,400
CRIMES.

73
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:06,800
BUT SOMETIMES THEY PLEAD TO

74
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:08,233
THINGS THAT ARE, LIKE, I DUNNO,

75
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,633
LYING TO THE FBI, WHICH IS, IN A

76
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,200
VERY REAL SENSE, A FUCKING

77
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:12,867
CRIME.

78
00:02:12,934 --> 00:02:14,042
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IF

79
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:15,633
FLYNN HAD PLED GUILTY TO, LET'S

80
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,743
SAY, CONSTANTLY DISPLAYING THE

81
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:18,200
FACIAL EXPRESSION OF SOMEONE

82
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:20,233
WHOSE LUNCH BURRITO ISN'T

83
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,567
SITTING QUITE RIGHT, OR LOOKING

84
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:22,734
LIKE G.I. JOE'S EMOTIONALLY

85
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,233
WITHHOLDING FATHER.

86
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,533
THOSE AREN'T CRIMES.

87
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,500
LYING TO THE FBI, HOWEVER, IS.

88
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:29,367
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER

89
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:31,133
THAT WHAT FLYNN WAS LYING ABOUT

90
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,967
WAS HIS CONTACTS WITH A RUSSIAN

91
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:34,533
OFFICIAL AND THE FBI WAS IN THE

92
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,734
MIDST OF A RUSSIAN

93
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,734
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

94
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,033
INVESTIGATION.

95
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,400
AND ALL THIS IS PARTICULARLY

96
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:41,100
WORRYING BECAUSE THIS WAS A CASE

97
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,400
BROUGHT BY SPECIAL COUNSEL

98
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:43,967
ROBERT MUELLER, AND THE WHOLE

99
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,333
POINT OF HAVING A SPECIAL

100
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,333
COUNSEL INVESTIGATE WAS TO KEEP

101
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,443
THE PROCESS FREE FROM CONFLICTS

102
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,100
OF INTEREST.

103
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,867
BY DROPPING THESE CHARGES, BARR

104
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:51,976
COULD BE SETTING A DANGEROUS

105
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,076
PRECEDENT, THAT A PRESIDENT

106
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,567
COULD NOT JUST PARDON THE

107
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,600
SUBJECT OF AN INVESTIGATION BUT

108
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:57,567
HAVE HIS APPOINTEES INVALIDATE

109
00:02:57,633 --> 00:02:59,333
THE INVESTIGATION ITSELF.

110
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,000
IT'S A TRULY UNHEARD-OF THING

111
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:02,266
FOR AN ATTORNEY GENERAL TO DO,

112
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,567
BUT BARR REALLY DOESN'T SEEM TO

113
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:07,467
GIVE A FUCK.

114
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:09,200
WHEN HISTORY LOOKS BACK ON

115
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:11,100
THIS DECISION, HOW DO YOU THINK

116
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,834
IT WILL BE WRITTEN?

117
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,976
WELL, HISTORY IS WRITTEN BY

118
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,200
THE WINNERS, SO IT LARGELY

119
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:16,266
DEPENDS ON...

120
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:19,033
WHO'S WRITING THE HISTORY.

121
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,100
John: WOW!

122
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,209
NOW, IF I WERE THE PRESIDENT'S

123
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:23,800
LACKEY TRYING TO TWIST THE

124
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:25,300
JUSTICE SYSTEM TO HIS WILL, I

125
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:26,543
MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED THAT SIMPLE

126
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:27,934
QUESTION WITH SOMETHING LIKE

127
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,900
"HISTORY WILL SHOW THIS WAS THE

128
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:29,976
RIGHT DECISION, " OR " IT WAS A

129
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,133
TOUGH CALL BUT JUSTICE WAS

130
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,934
SERVED."

131
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,734
IT TAKES A SPECIAL KIND OF

132
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,133
ARROGANCE FOR THE NATION'S TOP

133
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,667
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL TO SAY,

134
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:39,166
"ACTUALLY, HISTORY IS A LIE WE

135
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:42,533
TELL OURSELVES AS WE FALL

136
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,066
ASLEEP AT NIGHT, THE WORLD IS

137
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:45,176
NOTHING BUT FORMLESS CHAOS, AND

138
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,209
THERE IS NO TRUTH BUT THAT WHICH

139
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:48,633
THE STRONG IMPOSE UPON THE WEAK.

140
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,000
YOU GET IT, RIGHT?

141
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:52,767
YOU DEFINITELY GET IT."

142
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:53,734
AS FOR THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF, HE

143
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,300
SPENT THE WEEK CONTINUING TO

144
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:54,967
MANAGE THE OPTICS ON HIS

145
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:55,967
INABILITY TO MANAGE THE

146
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:57,333
CORONAVIRUS, EVEN TRAVELING TO A

147
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,609
MASK FACTORY, WHERE HE MADE THE

148
00:03:58,633 --> 00:04:00,433
CONSPICUOUS CHOICE NOT TO WEAR A

149
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,580
MASK, PROMPTING AN ENTIRELY

150
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:02,753
REASONABLE QUESTION THE NEXT

151
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,433
DAY.

152
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,767
MR. PRESIDENT, YESTERDAY WE

153
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:08,333
WENT TO ARIZONA, AND YOU HAD

154
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,443
SAID BEFORE THE TRIP THAT YOU

155
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:10,133
WOULD LIKELY WEAR A MASK AT THE

156
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,567
MASK FACTORY.

157
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:12,467
YOU ENDED UP NOT WEARING ONE.

158
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:13,400
WELL, I ACTUALLY DID HAVE

159
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:14,233
ONE.

160
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,700
WE DIDN'T SEE YOU WITH A MASK

161
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:16,300
ON.

162
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:17,443
WELL, I CAN'T HELP IT IF YOU

163
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:17,834
DIDN'T SEE ME.

164
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,467
John: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

165
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:19,367
ABOUT?

166
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:20,443
"I CAN'T HELP IT IF YOU DIDN'T

167
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:20,900
SEE ME"?

168
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:21,967
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

169
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:23,433
IT'S A PHOTO OP.

170
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,834
THE WHOLE POINT IS TO SHOW THEM

171
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:26,076
THE THING THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED

172
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,300
TO BE DOING.

173
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:30,266
STILL, I WILL SAY THIS, FOR ALL

174
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,200
TRUMP'S IDEOLOGICAL WAVERING

175
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:33,467
OVER THE YEARS, ONE THING HAS

176
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:35,133
REMAINED CONSISTENT: HE'S NEVER

177
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,100
USED PROTECTION, AND HE'S NEVER

178
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:36,900
NOT BEEN AN ASSHOLE ABOUT IT

179
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:39,233
AFTERWARDS.

180
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,066
BUT TRUMP'S REFUSAL TO WEAR A

181
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:42,233
FACE MASK, DESPITE THE FACT

182
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,867
THAT, SINCE APRIL 3, THE CDC HAS

183
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:45,734
RECOMMENDED EVERYONE WEAR THEM,

184
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,876
SEEMS ESPECIALLY UNWISE, GIVEN

185
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,633
THAT MULTIPLE WHITE HOUSE

186
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,600
STAFFERS HAVE NOW TESTED

187
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,033
POSITIVE, WHICH, IN TURN, MAKES

188
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,800
ONE OF THE MUSIC CHOICES FOR

189
00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:54,943
THAT MASK FACTORY TOUR EVEN

190
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:56,233
GRIMMER.

191
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,333
THIS IS THE MATERIAL THAT

192
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,667
TRAPS THE PARTICULATES...

193
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:04,333
♪ LIVE AND LET DIE ♪

194
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:11,633
♪ LIVE AND LET DIE ♪

195
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,633
John: YEAH.

196
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,433
THAT WAS THE GUNS 'N ROSES COVER

197
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,667
OF THE SONG "LIVE AND LET DIE,"

198
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:17,974
WHICH IS ABOUT AS ON THE NOSE A

199
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,233
SOUNDTRACK CHOICE AS YOU CAN GET

200
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,367
WITHOUT PLAYING THE

201
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:23,633
DEAD KENNEDYS' "KILL THE POOR."

202
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,433
AND IT'S A WEIRD CHOICE OF SONG

203
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,567
NO MATTER WHAT, BUT IT'S

204
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:27,233
ESPECIALLY WEIRD GIVEN THAT

205
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,767
AXL ROSE IS NO FAN OF THIS

206
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:31,200
ADMINISTRATION, EVEN TWEETING

207
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:31,700
THE VERY NEXT DAY, "IT'S

208
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:32,633
OFFICIAL!

209
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,400
WHATEVER ANYONE MAY HAVE

210
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:34,500
PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT OF

211
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:35,233
STEVE MNUCHIN, HE'S OFFICIALLY

212
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,367
AN ASSHOLE."

213
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:38,033
WHICH KICKED OFF AN INCREDIBLE

214
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,500
EXCHANGE IN WHICH MNUCHIN

215
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:41,810
RESPONDED BY WRITING, "WHAT HAVE

216
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:42,834
YOU DONE FOR YOUR COUNTRY

217
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:44,033
LATELY," ACCOMPANIED BY THE

218
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,343
LIBERIAN FLAG, TO WHICH AXL ROSE

219
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:47,233
THEN REPLIED, IN A SINGLE

220
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,200
SENTENCE, "MY BAD, I DIDN'T GET

221
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:50,266
WE'RE HOPING TO EMULATE

222
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,609
LIBERIA'S ECONOMIC MODEL, BUT ON

223
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:52,934
THE REAL, UNLIKE THIS ADMIN, I'M

224
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,500
NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR 70K PLUS

225
00:05:54,567 --> 00:06:02,266
DEATHS N' UNLIKE YOU I DON'T

226
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,700
HOLD A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

227
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:05,000
POSITION OF RESPONSIBILITY TO

228
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:06,400
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE N' GO ON TV

229
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:07,509
TELLIN' THEM TO TRAVEL TO THE

230
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,066
U.S. DURING A PANDEMIC."

231
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:08,800
AND THERE ARE MANY AMAZING

232
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:09,467
THINGS ABOUT THAT, BUT MOST OF

233
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:10,333
ALL, YOU GOT TO RESPECT AXL'S

234
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,233
COMMITMENT TO THE "N'."

235
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,309
I BET HE TAKES HIS COFFEE WITH

236
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,033
MILK N' SUGAR.

237
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,433
WHEN HE GETS DRESSED, HE LIKES

238
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,400
TO PUT ON A T-SHIRT N' KILT.

239
00:06:17,467 --> 00:06:18,266
AND I BET HIS FAVORITE BOOK IS

240
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,266
"HARRY POTTER N' THE PRISONER OF

241
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,967
AZKABAN."

242
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:21,867
BECAUSE HE'S A PROFESSIONAL, AND

243
00:06:21,934 --> 00:06:24,033
HIS ART IS HIS LIFE.

244
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,867
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, TRUMP'S

245
00:06:25,934 --> 00:06:27,166
CAVALIER ATTITUDE SEEMS TO BE

246
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:28,133
TRICKLING DOWN, BECAUSE SOME

247
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,467
STATES ARE NOW LETTING

248
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:31,200
STAY-AT-HOME ORDERS EXPIRE, EVEN

249
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,166
THOUGH MANY OF THEM DON'T MEET

250
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:34,100
THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES

251
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,834
SUGGESTING THEY ONLY REOPEN ONCE

252
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,133
CASES BEGIN TO DECLINE.

253
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,967
AND WHILE THAT WILL ALMOST

254
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:40,367
CERTAINLY PUT AMERICAN LIVES AT

255
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,900
RISK, TRUMP'S NEW TACTIC IS TO

256
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:43,767
FRAME THAT AS A POSITIVE.

257
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:45,133
ALL PEOPLE ARE WARRIORS IN

258
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,934
THIS COUNTRY.

259
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,200
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE ALL WARRIORS.

260
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:48,734
YOU'RE WARRIORS, WE'RE WARRIORS.

261
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,633
YOU CAN BE WITH SOMEBODY,

262
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,934
EVERYTHING IS FINE, AND THEN

263
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,367
SOMETHING HAPPENS TO THAT

264
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:53,643
PERSON, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU

265
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:56,200
TEST POSITIVE.

266
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:57,376
AND WE'RE ALL WARRIORS TOGETHER.

267
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,633
I AM.

268
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,433
YOU ARE.

269
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,867
WE ALL ARE.

270
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:01,934
John: OH, ARE WE?

271
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:03,166
THAT'S INTERESTING.

272
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:04,600
BECAUSE WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE

273
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:09,633
TO BE WARRIORS.

274
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,000
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE,

275
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:11,633
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE THROWING US

276
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,367
INTO BATTLE UNARMED BEFORE WE

277
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,066
HAVE MECHANISMS SET UP TO TEST,

278
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:13,700
ISOLATE, AND TRACE CASES OF THE

279
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,533
VIRUS.

280
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,033
YOU CAN'T JUST CALL EVERYONE

281
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,700
"WARRIORS" AND MAKE THEIR DEATHS

282
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:19,567
NOT COUNT.

283
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:21,066
YOU GET THE SENSE THAT, IF GOD

284
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:22,467
HAD TOLD TRUMP ABOUT THE FLOOD,

285
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:24,033
HE WOULDN'T HAVE BOTHERED

286
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,340
BUILDING THE ARK, HE WOULD HAVE

287
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,033
JUST TRIED TO CONVINCE THE

288
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,000
ANIMALS THEY'RE ALL FISH.

289
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:34,300
"WE'RE ALL FISH TOGETHER NOW.

290
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:35,300
I'M A FISH, YOU'RE A FISH, WE'RE

291
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:35,567
ALL FISH."

292
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:36,333
AND TRUMP'S ALLIES ARE BEHIND

293
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:36,967
HIM ON THIS CALL TO ACTION.

294
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:37,734
ONE OF HIS FAVORITE FOX NEWS

295
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,000
HOSTS, PETE HEGSETH, SEEN HERE

296
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:39,700
SHOWING OFF THE CARCASS OF AN

297
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:40,667
AMERICAN FLAG HE MURDERED, TOOK

298
00:07:40,734 --> 00:07:42,834
THAT IDEA AND RAN WITH IT.

299
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,266
I DO THINK YOU'RE GONNA NEED

300
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,066
THAT KIND OF ETHOS AND THAT

301
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,700
SPIRIT TO PUT FREEDOM BEFORE

302
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:48,667
FEAR.

303
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:49,567
HEALTHY PEOPLE GETTING OUT

304
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:51,266
THERE, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

305
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,467
HAVE SOME COURAGE.

306
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:55,734
AND SO I THINK THAT SPIRIT, THE

307
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,042
AMERICAN SPIRIT FRANKLY IS... IS

308
00:07:57,066 --> 00:08:02,166
IN FULL SUPPLY AND READY TO GO.

309
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:03,309
John: OH, YEAH, THE AMERICAN

310
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:03,867
SPIRIT IS ABSOLUTELY IN FULL

311
00:08:03,934 --> 00:08:04,500
SUPPLY, IF BY "AMERICAN SPIRIT"

312
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,567
YOU MEAN "GHOSTS."

313
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,033
BECAUSE WE'RE CHURNING OUT

314
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,600
GHOSTS LIKE IT'S 1918, BABY.

315
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:09,600
WE ARE POSITIVELY SWIMMING IN

316
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,533
ECTOPLASM.

317
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,467
I'M TELLING YOU, IF YOU COULD

318
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:14,734
WIPE YOUR ASS WITH GHOSTS, THE

319
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,533
AMERICAN PEOPLE WOULD TRULY WANT

320
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,333
FOR NOTHING RIGHT NOW.

321
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,233
THE THING IS, ALL THIS TALK OF

322
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,667
AMERICANS BEING "BRAVE WARRIORS"

323
00:08:22,734 --> 00:08:25,133
SEEMS DESIGNED TO MAKE US ACCEPT

324
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,567
DEATHS THAT WE SHOULD BE TRYING

325
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:29,667
TO PREVENT.

326
00:08:29,734 --> 00:08:30,367
AND YET THIS ADMINISTRATION

327
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:31,367
SEEMS, AT TIMES, TO BE ACTIVELY

328
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:32,266
HOSTILE TO THOSE PREVENTION

329
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:32,900
EFFORTS, TO THE POINT THAT, ON

330
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:35,000
THURSDAY, WE LEARNED THIS:

331
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:36,343
AS THE PRESIDENT URGES STATES

332
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:37,867
TO REOPEN, THE CDC HAS PREPARED

333
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,633
A DRAFT ROADMAP TO HELP

334
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,967
RESTAURANTS, SCHOOLS, CHURCHES,

335
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:44,467
AND OTHERS TO DO IT SAFELY.

336
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:45,667
BUT TODAY, WE LEARNED

337
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:46,467
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS REJECTED

338
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:47,433
THAT DRAFT.

339
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,676
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, WHO WAS

340
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,867
FIRST TO REPORT THE

341
00:08:49,934 --> 00:08:51,066
ADMINISTRATION'S HOLD ON THE

342
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:52,900
GUIDELINES, SAYING A CDC

343
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:54,076
OFFICIAL TOLD THEM THE AGENCY'S

344
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,300
SCIENTISTS WERE TOLD THE

345
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:56,266
DOCUMENT WOULD, "NEVER SEE THE

346
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,567
LIGHT OF DAY."

347
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:59,600
John: WOW.

348
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,500
"NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY."

349
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:03,800
IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE HOW

350
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:05,133
DRACONIAN THAT IS, OR AT LEAST

351
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,133
IT WAS BEFORE "NEVER SEEING THE

352
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,309
LIGHT OF DAY" BECAME THE ONLY

353
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,867
THING ON ALL OF OUR SCHEDULES.

354
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:12,209
HONESTLY, TELL ME, WHAT DOES THE

355
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:12,800
SUN LOOK LIKE?

356
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:13,700
DOES IT HAVE COOL SHADES AND AN

357
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:19,834
ATTITUDE, OR WAS THAT JUST

358
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,567
SOMETHING THAT WE MADE UP IN THE

359
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:21,066
PAST?

360
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:21,834
I SINCERELY CAN'T REMEMBER.

361
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,943
SO THIS IS WHERE WE ARE NOW:

362
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:23,700
OUR WARTIME PRESIDENT HAS

363
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:24,876
DECIDED THAT THE ONLY WAY TO WIN

364
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,076
THIS WAR IS TO DRAFT EVERY ONE

365
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,533
OF US, HIDE OUR BATTLE PLANS,

366
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,834
AND HOPE THAT WE'RE ALL BRAVE

367
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,009
ENOUGH NOT TO NOTICE THAT WE'VE

368
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:33,166
ALREADY SURRENDERED.

369
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:34,276
OR, TO PUT IT MORE SUCCINCTLY...

370
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,934
AND TO QUOTE WHAT SEEMS TO BE

371
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,800
ONE OF HIS FAVORITE SONGS... HIS

372
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,633
PLAN TO STEER US THROUGH THIS

373
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,780
PANDEMIC IS FOR HIM TO LIVE

374
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:40,867
WHILE LETTING A LOT OF US DIE.

375
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:46,500

376
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:48,667

COMPLAINTS OUT LOUD.

380
00:09:54,734 --> 00:09:58,300
MILLICENT SAYS SHE DOESN'T

381
00:09:58,367 --> 00:09:59,934
LIKE SEEING PEOPLE WEAR GLOVES.

382
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,667
MARK AND WEATHERFORD WANTS

383
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:06,066
LANDLORD, WHY IS IT ASSUMED THE

384
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:07,533
LANDLORDS HAVE NO BILLS TO PAY

385

AND ARE RICH?

386
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:10,867
WILLIAM WANTS SOMEBODY TO WIPE

387
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:13,700
DOWN CREDIT CARD KEYPADS.

388
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:15,233
ERIC HAS A DEEP STATE COVER.

389
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,533
SHE IS SICK OF SEEING SICK

390
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,066
PEOPLE.

391
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:20,142
PEOPLE SEEM TO BE COMPLAINING TO

392
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,176
COMPLAIN AND THEY DON'T KNOW

393
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,667
WHAT IS UP, LIKE THIS ONE FROM

394
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:25,300
COLLEEN, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

395
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:27,266
WHY YOU OUT ONLY SHOW THE

396
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:27,834
NEGATIVE WITH THIS VIRUS.

397
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,333
YOU KNOW THIS IS A PLOY TO

398
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,333
DESTROY OUR COUNTRY FROM THE

399
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:31,867
INSIDE.

400
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:34,633
WHY ARE THERE SO MANY PEOPLE

401
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,066
OUTSIDE TODAY?

402
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:36,767
WHY DON'T YOU REPORT ABOUT THE

403
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:36,934
FLU?

404
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,900
I AM APPALLED AT THE DECISION TO

405
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:41,200
ALLOW MASSAGE PARLORS, WE ALL

406
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,266
KNOW WHAT MASSAGE PARLORS MEAN.

407
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,367
ANIMALS CAN STILL GET GROOMED.

408
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:49,934
THIS IS A SLAP IN THE FACE

409
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,700
DEMONS.

410
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:52,233
STEVE EAGAR IS A SICK MAN.

411
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,300
TELL HIM TO LEAVE VIEWERS ALONE.

412
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:56,500
DON'T YOU REALIZE HOW STUPID

413
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:58,467
MOST OF THE VIEWING AUDIENCE IS?

414
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:02,500
OH, I AM AWARE, WENDY.

415
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:03,567
John: MOVING ON.

416
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:04,500
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

417
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:05,100
THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE, THE

418
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:05,667
ORGANIZATION THAT WOULD HAVE

FORGOTTEN TO MAIL ONE LIKE AN

00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,166
UNGRATEFUL SACK OF SHIT.

423
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:11,133
THE USPS PROVIDES VALUABLE

424
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,242

THAT'S A CAKE ON A CAKE.

452
00:12:08,233 --> 00:12:09,100
KEEP CRASHING TIKTOKS, YOU

453
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:09,633
NATIONAL FUCKING TREASURE.

454
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,710
THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS A RICH

455
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:11,734
AND STORIED HISTORY.

456
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,066
IT ACTUALLY PREDATES THE

457
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:16,900
FOUNDING OF THE COUNTRY AND IT

458
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:17,867
HAS AN OBLIGATION TO BRING MAIL

459
00:12:17,934 --> 00:12:18,600
TO EVERY SINGLE HOUSEHOLD, EVEN

460
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:19,743
TRANSPORTING IT TO THE BOTTOM OF

461
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:20,533
THE GRAND CANYON BY MULE.

462
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,800
OVER THE YEARS, AMERICANS HAVE

463
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:23,367
RELIED ON IT FOR A SURPRISINGLY

464
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:24,467
WIDE VARIETY OF NEEDS.

465
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:25,643
COUNTRY CHILDREN OFTEN WATCH

466
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,500
FOR THE MAILMAN.

467
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:29,233
JUST SEE WHAT HAS COME TODAY.

468
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,333
A BIG BOX WITH MANY HOLES IN IT.

469
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,333
THE BOX IS FULL OF BABY CHICKS.

470
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,166
BABY CHICKS DON'T HAVE TO EAT OR

471
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:37,242
DRINK FOR A WHOLE DAY AFTER

472
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:38,276
THEY'RE HATCHED, SO THEY CAN

473
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,033
TRAVEL SAFELY THROUGH THE MAIL.

474
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,467
John: IT'S TRUE.

475
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:42,433
YOU USED TO BE ABLE TO SEND LIVE

476
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,967
BABY CHICKS THROUGH THE MAIL.

477
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:45,233
AND GUESS WHAT?

478
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,600
YOU STILL CAN!

479
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,333
THE POSTAL SERVICE WILL

480
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,066
TRANSPORT ALL KINDS OF LIVE

481
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:53,633
POULTRY FOR YOU, INCLUDING

482
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,300
CHICKENS, DUCKS, GEESE, AND

483
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:56,066
TURKEYS.

484
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:57,142
WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION, WHY

485
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:57,767
THE FUCK WOULD I EVER SEND A

486
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:59,114
GREETING CARD AGAIN WHEN I COULD

487
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,209
MAIL SOMEONE A BIRTHDAY TURKEY

488
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:01,533
OR A THANK YOU DUCK OR A

489
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
SYMPATHY GOOSE?

490
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:03,900
WHO WOULDN'T WANT A SYMPATHY

491
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:05,166
GOOSE?

492
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:07,500
I MEAN, SURE, YOUR NANA'S DEAD.

493
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:08,807
BUT NOW YOU HAVE A SMALL GOOSE!

494
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:09,700
WHICH IS... AND THIS IS TRUE...

495
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:11,100
BETTER.

496
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,033
BUT THE CURRENT PANDEMIC IS

497
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:14,700
OBVIOUSLY MAKING THINGS VERY

498
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:16,500
DIFFICULT FOR POSTAL WORKERS, AS

499
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:17,433
YOU PROBABLY KNOW FROM SEEING

500
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,400
STORIES LIKE THESE.

501
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:24,867
I AM VERY WORRIED, VERY

502
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,133
WORRIED, I MEAN, TO THE POINT

503
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:27,500
THAT I WORRY ABOUT COMING TO

504
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:28,600
WORK EVERY DAY.

505
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:29,843
I DON'T WANT TO CONTRACT IT,

506
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:30,400
TO BRING IT BACK TO MY FAMILY.

507
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:31,066
DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE AT

508
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:31,867
RISK EVERY TIME YOU GO TO WORK?

509
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:33,166
YES.

510
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:34,700
CAN'T SAY THAT IT'S NOT ON

511
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:39,967
THE BACK OF EVERYBODY'S MIND.

512
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:41,500
THERE IS A JOKE AMONGST THE

513
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:42,643
OFFICE, ARE WE ESSENTIAL OR ARE

514
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:43,200
WE SACRIFICIAL?

515
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:44,000
John: HOLY SHIT, THAT IS A

516
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:44,400
DARK JOKE.

517
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:45,200
MOST OFFICE HUMOR IS ON THE

518
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:45,867
LEVEL OF "WORKING HARD OR HARDLY

519
00:13:45,934 --> 00:13:46,367
WORKING?"

520
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:48,400
OR "SOMEONE'S MICROWAVING FISH

521
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:50,033
AGAIN, " NOT " WILL ANY OF US DIE

522
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,900
TODAY, LMFAO."

523
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:52,967
AND THOSE FEARS ARE NOT

524
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,266
MISPLACED.

525
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,834
OVER A THOUSAND POSTAL WORKERS

526
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,734
HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR

527
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,910
COVID-19, AND MORE THAN 40 HAVE

528
00:13:57,934 --> 00:14:00,066
DIED.

529
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:01,967
BUT BOTH IN ADDITION TO AND

530
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:03,934
BECAUSE OF THE ONGOING PANDEMIC,

531
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,834
THESE WORKERS ARE ALSO HAVING TO

532
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,943
GRAPPLE WITH ANOTHER EXISTENTIAL

533
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:09,066
THREAT: THE POSTAL SERVICE MAY

534
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:10,433
BE ABOUT TO GO BROKE.

535
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,066
THE OUTGOING POSTMASTER GENERAL

536
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:13,900
RECENTLY ASKED CONGRESS FOR A

537
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:16,300
TOTAL OF $89 BILLION, AND

538
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:17,700
WITHOUT FINANCIAL HELP, THE USPS

539
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:20,200
MAY NOT MAKE IT PAST SEPTEMBER

540
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:21,834
WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT SERVICE

541
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,000
INTERRUPTIONS, WHICH IS

542
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:24,209
UPSETTING, ESPECIALLY DURING AN

543
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:25,633
ELECTION YEAR, A CENSUS YEAR,

544
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,700
AND A PANDEMIC THAT HAS PEOPLE

545
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,467
HOUSEBOUND.

546
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:31,734
AND I KNOW PEOPLE LIKE TO

547
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,233
COMPLAIN ABOUT THE POST OFFICE,

548
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,633
BUT THE TRUTH IS, IT DOES

549
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,633
VERY IMPORTANT WORK.

550
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,367
AND MANY PEOPLE REALLY RELY ON

551
00:14:38,433 --> 00:14:39,834
IT, NOT JUST TO RECEIVE

552
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,266
PACKAGES, BUT IN RURAL AREAS IN

553
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,509
PARTICULAR, A POST OFFICE CAN BE

554
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:43,900
A COMMUNITY HUB THAT BRINGS

555
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,166
PEOPLE TOGETHER.

556
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:46,567
JUST LISTEN TO THIS POSTMASTER

557
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,033
IN RURAL COLORADO TELL A

558
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,900
HEARTWARMING STORY WITH A BIT OF

559
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:52,200
A TWIST.

560
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,667
POSTMASTER BURGER SAYS

561
00:14:53,734 --> 00:14:54,976
NEIGHBORS WHO LIVE FAR APART RUN

562
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,166
INTO EACH OTHER AT THE POST

563
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:56,900
OFFICE.

564
00:14:56,967 --> 00:14:58,076
THAT'S HOW EVERYBODY KEEPS IN

565
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,967
TOUCH, INCLUDING HIM.

566
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,567
IT'S PROVIDED ME THE

567
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:03,066
OPPORTUNITY TO... TO KNOW THESE

568
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:04,176
PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN MORE THAN I

569
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,867
EVER THOUGHT I WOULD KNOW.

570
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:07,100
EVEN TO THE DEGREE WHERE

571
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,667
SOMETIMES ON MY LUNCH HOUR I

572
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:09,633
FIND MYSELF HELPING A NEIGHBOR

573
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,633
BURY HIS DOG.

574
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,100
John: OKAY.

575
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,300
FIRST: WHAT?

576
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:15,500
SECOND: EXCUSE ME?

577
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:16,934
AND THIRD, JUST TO CIRCLE BACK:

578
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,734
THE FUCK?

579
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,100
ALSO, YOU JUST SAID "SOMETIMES"

580
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:21,700
YOU HELP BURY A DOG.

581
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:22,767
THAT'S PLURAL.

582
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,700
MEANING YOU'VE DONE IT MORE THAN

583
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:24,367
ONCE.

584
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:25,576
AND HELPING SOMEONE DO THAT ONCE

585
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,500
IS A COURTESY, BUT WHEN IT

586
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:28,643
STARTS BECOMING A REGULAR THING,

587
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:30,300
YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHY THE

588
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:31,443
NEIGHBORHOOD DOGS KEEP DYING AND

589
00:15:31,467 --> 00:15:33,967
WHY YOU'RE ALWAYS THERE.

590
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,100
THE POINT IS, AT THE WORST

591
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,667
POSSIBLE TIME, THIS AMERICAN

592
00:15:37,734 --> 00:15:39,600
INSTITUTION IS ON THE BRINK OF

593
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:40,433
COLLAPSE.

594
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,676
SO TONIGHT, WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT

595
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,133
BE WORTH ASKING WHY THAT IS AND

596
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,600
WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT.

597
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:45,743
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

598
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:47,007
THAT, DESPITE BEING PART OF THE

599
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:47,867
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THE POSTAL

600
00:15:47,934 --> 00:15:49,000
SERVICE IS ACTUALLY A

601
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:50,900
SELF-FUNDED ENTITY.

602
00:15:50,967 --> 00:15:52,800
IT OPERATES INDEPENDENTLY AND IS

603
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:53,700
MEANT TO PAY FOR ITSELF WITH THE

604
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:54,567
MONEY THAT IT MAKES FROM

605
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:57,934
SERVICES AND POSTAGE.

606
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,867
THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY, OVER THE

607
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:00,433
YEARS, IT'S OFTEN TRIED TO

608
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,900
ENCOURAGE STAMP COLLECTING WITH

609
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:03,834

THE DANK GET WELL STAMP WITH

626
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:35,100
IRISES TO MY PERSONAL FAVORITE,

627
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,000
THE ONE THAT SAYS "LACEMAKING."

628
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:38,533
AND I THINK I SPEAK FOR COOL

629
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,066
KIDS EVERYWHERE WHEN I SAY

630
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,253
THERE'S NOTHING DOPER THAN A

631
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,734
TOTALLY BITCHIN' LACE STAMP.

632
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,367
I'M JUST WORRIED IT MIGHT BE

633
00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:50,433
TOO COOL.

634
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,667
AND YOU MAY THINK YOU KNOW WHY

635
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,266
THE POSTAL SERVICE IS IN SO MUCH

636
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:52,934
TROUBLE... THAT THE INTERNET AND

637
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,500
EMAIL MEAN THAT PEOPLE JUST

638
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:53,967
DON'T USE IT AS MUCH.

639
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:54,700
BUT THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE MAIN

640
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:55,834
REASON.

641
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,633
IN FACT, EXPERTS BELIEVE IT

642
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,133
WOULD STILL BE TURNING A PROFIT

643
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,667
WERE IT NOT FOR A 2006 LAW

644
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:00,433
CALLED THE POSTAL ACCOUNTABILITY

645
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,900
AND ENHANCEMENT ACT.

646
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:05,533
NOW, ONE OF THE THINGS IT

647
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,609
REQUIRED WAS FOR THE USPS TO

648
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:08,133
PREPAY HEALTH CARE BENEFITS FOR

649
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,667
RETIREES ON A 50-YEAR SCHEDULE,

650
00:17:09,734 --> 00:17:11,266
STARTING WITH AN AGGRESSIVE

651
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,600
OBLIGATION TO SET ASIDE OVER

652
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:15,166
$5 BILLION A YEAR FOR 10 YEARS.

653
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:16,834
THAT, IN ITSELF, WAS A MASSIVE

654
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,300
BURDEN TO PUT ON THE POSTAL

655
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:20,800
SERVICE, BUT THE LAW ALSO

656
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:22,467
LIMITED ITS FLEXIBILITY TO RAISE

657
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:24,166
MONEY BY PUTTING PRICE CAPS ON

658
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:25,500
MAJOR PRODUCTS LIKE FIRST-CLASS

659
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:27,800
MAIL.

660
00:17:27,867 --> 00:17:29,367
SO THEY HAD MASSIVE NEW

661
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:30,476
OBLIGATIONS TO MEET EVEN AS

662
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,400
THEIR INCOME WAS BASICALLY

663
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:33,400
LOCKED IN PLACE.

664
00:17:33,467 --> 00:17:34,834
IN HINDSIGHT, IT SEEMS LIKE A

665
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,009
PRETTY CLEAR DEATH SENTENCE,

666
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:37,333
WHICH IS WHAT MAKES IT SO

667
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,200
STRANGE THAT IT PASSED LARGELY

668
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,467
UNNOTICED AT THE TIME AND WITH

669
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:42,200
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.

670
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:44,100
AND THE EFFECT WAS ALMOST

671
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,400
IMMEDIATE, BECAUSE THE POSTAL

672
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:48,033
SERVICE WENT FROM REPORTING A

673
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,900
NET INCOME OF $900 MILLION IN

674
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:53,066
2006 TO A LOSS OF $3.8 BILLION

675
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:54,934
JUST THREE YEARS LATER.

676
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,100
AND GOOD LUCK SELLING ENOUGH

677
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,767
DOPE-ASS LACE STAMPS TO GET

678
00:17:59,834 --> 00:18:01,333
YOURSELF OUT OF THAT HOLE.

679
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,600
SO THE TRUTH IS, THE POSTAL

680
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,533
SERVICE'S PROBLEMS AREN'T

681
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,367
ENTIRELY FROM THE FACT THAT WE

682
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:08,333
STARTED USING EMAIL OR EVEN THE

683
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,433
2008 RECESSION.

684
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,033
IN FACT, IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED

685
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,209
THAT THE STIPULATIONS OF THIS

686
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:16,133
ONE LAW HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR

687
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,133
APPROXIMATELY 74% OF THEIR

688
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,233
NET LOSSES SINCE IT PASSED, AND

689
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,376
THAT IS DESPITE THEM SHEDDING

690
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:23,800
OVER 100,000 JOBS.

691
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:24,600
AND THE FACT THEY WERE SO BADLY

692
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:25,676
HOBBLED BY AN ACT OF CONGRESS

693
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,843
MAKES IT A LITTLE INFURIATING

694
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:28,166
THAT SOME, LIKE FORMER FOX NEWS

695
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,500
COMMENTATOR JOHN STOSSEL, HOLD

696
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,609
IT UP AS A SIGN THAT GOVERNMENT

697
00:18:30,633 --> 00:18:32,433
AGENCIES ARE JUST NATURALLY

698
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,900
BLOATED AND INCOMPETENT.

699
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:37,567
ANOTHER MYTH.

700
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:38,533
GOVERNMENT CAN RUN THE POST

701
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,467
OFFICE LIKE A BUSINESS.

702
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:41,000
BUT REAL BUSINESSES CAN'T LOSE

703
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:43,100
BILLIONS EVERY YEAR.

704
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,500
$16 BILLION LAST YEAR.

705
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:45,800
FEDEX, UPS, AND OTHERS MAKE

706
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:47,767
BILLIONS BECAUSE THEY INNOVATE

707
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:49,433
AND CUT COSTS.

708
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,066
John: OKAY, THERE'S A LOT

709
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:52,567
WRONG WITH THAT, BUT HE'S RIGHT

710
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,100
THAT FEDEX IS PRETTY GOOD AT

711
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,066
INNOVATING.

712
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,967
FOR EXAMPLE, YOU'VE PROBABLY

713
00:18:57,033 --> 00:18:57,800
SEEN THE ARROW HIDDEN IN THE

714
00:18:57,867 --> 00:18:58,800
FEDEX LOGO, BUT DID YOU KNOW

715
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:01,934
THAT, FOR YEARS, THERE USED TO

716
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,900
BE A SWASTIKA HIDDEN IN THE

717
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:07,367
"D"?

718
00:19:07,433 --> 00:19:08,673
YEAH, ONCE YOU SEE IT, LIKE THE

719
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:09,500
ARROW, YOU CAN'T UNSEE IT.

720
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:10,066
BUT THEY TOOK IT OUT BECAUSE

721
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:11,033
BUSINESSES HAVE TO INNOVATE.

722
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,109
NOW, WHAT STOSSEL IS ADVOCATING

723
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:12,600
FOR THERE... AND WHAT MANY

724
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:13,500
CONSERVATIVES WOULD PREFER... IS

725
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:14,367
FOR THE POSTAL SERVICE TO BE

726
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:15,166
PRIVATIZED.

727
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:16,467
BUT THERE ARE SOME HUGE

728
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:17,834
DRAWBACKS TO THAT IDEA.

729
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,140
FOR STARTERS... AS YOU MAY HAVE

730
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,467
NOTICED... FEDEX AND UPS CHARGE

731
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:22,967
A FUCK OF A LOT MORE TO DELIVER

732
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:25,066
THAN THE POSTAL SERVICE DOES.

733
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:28,934
ALSO, THOSE REMOTE ADDRESSES

734
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,934
THAT THEY ARE OBLIGATED TO

735
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,700
DELIVER TO AREN'T JUST DIFFICULT

736
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:31,867
TO GET TO, THEY'RE NOT

737
00:19:31,934 --> 00:19:32,834
PROFITABLE, AND IN ALL

738
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,009
LIKELIHOOD, COMPANIES WOULD CUT

739
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:35,367
THOSE ROUTES OFF, MEANING A LOT

740
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:36,734
OF PEOPLE WOULD LOSE ACCESS.

741
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,700
AND TO HIS CREDIT, JOHN STOSSEL

742
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:46,467
FULLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT,

743
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:47,333
ALTHOUGH HE BASICALLY SAYS IN

744
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:47,967
RESPONSE, "TOUGH SHIT."

745
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:48,633
THE CONSTITUTION SAYS

746
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,433
CONGRESS HAS THE POWER TO

747
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:49,934
ESTABLISH POST OFFICES.

748
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,600
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO AND IT

749
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:51,400
DOESN'T HAVE TO DELIVER MAIL TO

750
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:52,233
ALL OF AMERICA.

751
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,100
WHO SAYS THERE NEEDS TO BE

752
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,834
UNIVERSAL SERVICE?

753
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,934
IF I LIVE WAY OUT IN THE

754
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:04,000
BOONDOCKS, I CAN GET E-MAIL.

755
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,200
John: NOW, IT'S HARD TO

756
00:20:05,266 --> 00:20:05,600
DECIDE WHAT I LIKE

757
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:06,300
LEAST ABOUT THAT: HIS DISMISSIVE

758
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:06,767
ATTITUDE TOWARDS RURAL

759
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:07,266
AMERICANS; THE INCORRECT

760
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,100
ASSUMPTION THAT EMAIL IS A

761
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,700
DECENT SUBSTITUTE FOR THE POSTAL

762
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:10,633
SERVICE, CONVENIENTLY GLOSSING

763
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,300
OVER THE FACT THAT AN ESTIMATED

764
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:12,300
42 MILLION PEOPLE LACK ACCESS TO

765
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:14,300
BROADBAND INTERNET; OR THE

766
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:15,967
UNFORTUNATE FACT THAT

767
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:17,367
JOHN STOSSEL LOOKS LIKE WHAT

768
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:18,767
WOULD HAPPEN IF SOMEONE TRIED TO

769
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:21,300
QUEER EYE GERALDO RIVERA BUT IT

770
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:23,567
DIDN'T REALLY WORK.

771
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:24,643
AND AGAIN, THE POSTAL SERVICE

772
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:25,867
IS A LITERAL LIFELINE FOR MANY

773
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,333
AMERICANS.

774
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,900
IT REPORTEDLY DELIVERED

775
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:31,567
1.2 BILLION PRESCRIPTIONS LAST

776
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:33,300
YEAR, INCLUDING CLOSE TO 100% OF

777
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:35,066
PRESCRIPTIONS FROM THE VA.

778
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,934
AND WHILE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO

779
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,433
BUY MEDICINE ONLINE, YOU CAN'T

780
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,467
ACTUALLY DOWNLOAD MEDICINE FROM

781
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:41,633
THE INTERNET.

782
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,820
TO CLARIFY, YOU CAN DOWNLOAD

783
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,400
"THE MEDICINE"...

784
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:45,627
JEREMY RENNER'S COLLECTION OF

785
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:46,776
MUSIC-LIKE NOISES... FROM THE

786
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,700
INTERNET.

787
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:48,600
BUT... AND THIS IS IMPORTANT...

788
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:50,900
YOU SHOULDN'T.

789
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:56,166
AND THEN THERE'S THE POTENTIAL

790
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:56,600
BUSINESS IMPACTS OF

791
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:56,934
PRIVATIZATION.

792
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,500
SMALL BUSINESSES WOULD

793
00:20:57,567 --> 00:20:59,600
IMMEDIATELY BE AFFECTED IF

794
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:01,200
SERVICE WAS REDUCED, LIKE THIS

795
00:21:01,266 --> 00:21:01,934
ROCK ENGRAVING COMPANY

796
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,767
IN RURAL KANSAS.

797
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:03,834
FISHER ROCK IS ANOTHER

798
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,734
COMPANY THAT USES THE LOCAL POST

799
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,500
OFFICE TO SHIP SOME OF THEIR

800
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:06,734
SMALLER PRODUCTS.

801
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,734
JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY WE MAIL

802
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,467
OUT SOMETHING.

803
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:11,467
I HATE TO SEE THEM LOSE OUR POST

804
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:12,200
OFFICE IN HOME CITY.

805
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:14,100
IT'S HANDY FOR BUSINESSES LIKE

806
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,300
MYSELF JUST TO RUN IN THERE AND

807
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:18,133
GET POSTAGE AND... AND... AND

808
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,767
MAIL OUT ROCKS.

809
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:21,633
John: YEAH, IT WOULD BE A

810
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,066
REAL SHAME IF THAT BUSINESS

811
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:25,767
COULDN'T MAIL OUT ITS ROCKS,

812
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:26,943
LIKE THIS ONE THAT SAYS "REAL

813
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:28,367
WOMEN HEART LITTLE WIENERS," OR

814
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:31,100
THIS ONE THAT SAYS "THE GRASS IS

815
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,100
GREENER UNDER MY WIENER."

816
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,567
I MEAN, THAT'S A PERFECT ROCK.

817
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:35,300
IF THE POSTAL SERVICE STOPPED

818
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:36,000
DELIVERING GUT BUSTERS LIKE

819
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:37,367
THAT, IT WOULD BE A FUCKING

820
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:43,633
TRAGEDY.

821
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,367
ALTHOUGH NOT FOR ME, TO BE

822
00:21:45,433 --> 00:21:46,667
HONEST, SINCE I ALREADY BOUGHT

823
00:21:46,734 --> 00:21:48,667
MINE, AND I'VE GOT TO SAY, IT'S

824
00:21:48,734 --> 00:21:53,400
EVEN FUNNIER IN PERSON.

825
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:55,266
ONE OF THE FUNNIEST THINGS ABOUT

826
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,567
THIS IS HOW GENUINELY HEAVY IT

827
00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:57,734
IS.

828
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,633
AND IT'S NOT JUST SMALL

829
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,743
BUSINESSES... COMPANIES LIKE

830
00:21:59,767 --> 00:22:00,266
FEDEX AND UPS OFTEN HAND OFF

831
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,033
THEIR PACKAGES TO THE POSTAL

832
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,667
SERVICE FOR THE LAST LEG OF THE

833
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:02,266
DELIVERY, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL

834
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,000
AREAS.

835
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:03,700
AMAZON ALSO CONTRACTS MANY OF

836
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:04,967
ITS DELIVERIES OUT TO IT.

837
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,313
AND THAT, WEIRDLY ENOUGH, BRINGS

838
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,607
US TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS

839
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:08,934
STANDING IN THE WAY OF THE USPS

840
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,200
GETTING THE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE

841
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:13,233
IT SO BADLY NEEDS, BECAUSE THIS

842
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,934
GUY HAS STRONGLY OPPOSED GIVING

843
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,333
IT SUFFICIENT AID, AND MANY

844
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,433
BELIEVE THAT'S BECAUSE OF ITS

845
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,967
RELATIONSHIP WITH AMAZON, OWNED,

846
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:22,800
OF COURSE, BY JEFF BEZOS, WHO

847
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:24,767
ALSO OWNS "THE WASHINGTON POST,"

848
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:26,967
WHOSE POLITICAL COVERAGE IS

849
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:28,109
HATED BY THE PRESIDENT, WHO...

850
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:29,400
AS WE KNOW... MAKES POLICY

851
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:31,333
DECISIONS BASED ON HIS

852
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,576
NEVER-ENDING GAME OF SIX DEGREES

853
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,500
OF "HOW IS THIS ABOUT ME?"

854
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:35,500
JUST WATCH HIM TRY AND EXPLAIN

855
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:36,843
WHY THE POSTAL SERVICE SHOULDN'T

856
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:39,467
GET FEDERAL HELP.

857
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:43,300
THE POSTAL SERVICE IS A JOKE.

858
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:45,633
BECAUSE THEY'RE HANDING OUT

859
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,700
PACKAGES FOR AMAZON AND OTHER

860
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:49,200
INTERNET COMPANIES AND EVERY

861
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:50,667
TIME THEY BRING A PACKAGE, THEY

862
00:22:50,734 --> 00:22:52,200
LOSE MONEY ON IT.

863
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:53,834
THE POST OFFICE SHOULD RAISE THE

864
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,900
PRICE OF A PACKAGE BY

865
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:57,333
APPROXIMATELY FOUR TIMES.

866
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,867
BECAUSE THEY DON'T RAISE THEM.

867
00:22:58,934 --> 00:23:00,867
FOR SOME REASON... THESE PEOPLE

868
00:23:00,934 --> 00:23:03,000
HAVE BEEN IN THERE A LONG TIME.

869
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:04,867
BUT FOR SOME REASON, THEY'RE

870
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:07,934
VERY COZY WITH SOME OF THESE

871
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,300
COMPANIES, AND THEY DON'T RAISE

872
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:13,600
THE PRICE OF A PACKAGE.

873
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:14,467
John: OKAY, FIRST, THE POSTAL

874
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:16,500
SERVICE IS NOT A JOKE.

875
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:20,967
IT DELIVERS JOKES, YES, AND THEY

876
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,333
ARE, AS WE KNOW, HILARIOUS, BUT

877
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,100
IT'S NOT, IN ITSELF, A JOKE.

878
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:23,900
"GREENER UNDER MY WEINER."

879
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:24,567
THIS IS THE FUNNIEST ROCK OF ALL

880
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:28,867
TIME.

881
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:30,000
JESUS CHRIST!

882
00:23:30,066 --> 00:23:31,600
BUT SECOND, IF THE POSTAL

883
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:32,333
SERVICE QUADRUPLES PRICES ON

884
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,166
COMPANIES, THOSE PACKAGE

885
00:23:33,233 --> 00:23:34,242
DELIVERY COSTS WILL ALMOST

886
00:23:34,266 --> 00:23:35,467
CERTAINLY BE PASSED ON TO THE

887
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:36,266
CONSUMER, BECAUSE THEY'RE

888
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,576
COMPANIES, AND THEY DON'T GIVE A

889
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,700
SHIT.

890
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:41,367
AND THIRD, IT ISN'T CUTTING

891
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:43,834
SWEETHEART DEALS TO LOSE MONEY

892
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,467
ON EVERY DELIVERY, BECAUSE IN

893
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:46,033
ADDITION TO EVERYTHING ELSE

894
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,700
WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED, THAT

895
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:49,100
2006 LAW MADE IT ILLEGAL FOR THE

896
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:50,633
USPS TO PRICE PARCEL DELIVERY

897
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,700
BELOW ITS COST.

898
00:23:55,767 --> 00:24:03,667
SO, IN SUMMATION HERE, TRUMP IS

899
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:04,533
CONVINCED THAT THE POSTAL

900
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,843
SERVICE'S BIGGEST PROBLEM IS ONE

901
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:07,166
OF THE FEW THINGS THAT IS NOT

902
00:24:07,233 --> 00:24:07,800
ACTUALLY ONE OF ITS PROBLEMS.

903
00:24:07,867 --> 00:24:08,567
AND THAT'S NOT JUST ANNOYING,

904
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:09,266
IT'S WORRYING, ESPECIALLY AS,

905
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:09,967
JUST THIS WEEK, HE REPLACED THE

906
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,313
OUTGOING POSTMASTER GENERAL WITH

907
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,166
THIS GUY, LOUIS DeJOY, A MAJOR

908
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:14,533
TRUMP DONOR.

909
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:20,100
AND THAT APPOINTMENT HAS MANY

910
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,433
WORRIED MANY PEOPLE THAT TRUMP

911
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,200
MAY NOW BE ABLE TO BEND THE

912
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:22,900
POSTAL SERVICE TO HIS

913
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:23,767
WILL, PRESUMABLY MEANING THAT BY

914
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:25,233
NEXT YEAR, EVERY STAMP IN

915
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,400
AMERICA WILL FEATURE ONE OF

916
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,367
JEFF BEZOS' DICK PICS.

917
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:29,533
AND THE THING IS, THERE ARE

918
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,166
ABSOLUTELY SOLUTIONS THAT WOULD

919
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:31,433
ENABLE THE POSTAL SERVICE TO

920
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,467
HELP THEMSELVES, BUT FOR ALL THE

921
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:35,033
REASONS THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED,

922
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,220
THEIR HANDS ARE TIED WHEN IT

923
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:36,900
COMES TO PRICING ON THEIR MAIN

924
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:39,734
PRODUCT.

925
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,033
WHICH MAY ACTUALLY HELP EXPLAIN

926
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,834
SOME OF THEIR VERY WEIRD SIDE

927
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,300
HUSTLES.

928
00:24:43,367 --> 00:24:44,166
FOR INSTANCE, YOU CAN GO ON

929
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,000
THEIR SITE AND BUY THIS COSTUME

930
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:47,667
FOR YOUR DOG, WHICH IS A GREAT

931
00:24:47,734 --> 00:24:48,967
WAY TO MAKE YOUR DOG LOOK LIKE

932
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:49,700
IT'S PERFORMING A POSTAL-THEMED

933
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:51,166
RENDITION OF "DICK IN A BOX."

934
00:24:51,233 --> 00:24:56,934
ALSO, A FEW YEARS BACK, THEY

935
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,767
ENTERED INTO A BIZARRE

936
00:24:57,834 --> 00:24:58,700
PARTNERSHIP WITH

937
00:24:58,767 --> 00:24:59,776
FOREVER 21 TO UNVEIL A POSTAL

938
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,333
SERVICE-THEMED FASHION LINE.

939
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,200
ALTHOUGH, AS THIS YOUTUBER WILL

940
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:01,767
TELL YOU, THERE WERE A FEW

941
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,133
ISSUES WITH THEIR GARMENTS:

942
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,433
OH, MY GOSH.

943
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,533
WHY... WHY IS ANY OF THIS

944
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,467
HAPPENING?

945
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:10,300
IT'S LIKE, YES, I AM A PRIORITY.

946
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:13,233
MY BOOBS ARE THE PRIORITY.

947
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,033
OVERALL I'M GONNA GIVE IT

948
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,100
A 3.5 OUT OF 10.

949
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:18,433
John: YEAH, WHEN YOU'RE

950
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,900
WEARING NOTHING BUT THE WORD

951
00:25:20,967 --> 00:25:23,133
"PRIORITY" STRETCHED OVER YOUR

952
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,309
CHEST, IT'S WEIRD TO REALIZE THE

953
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:25,166
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION "WHY IS

954
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:26,433
ANY OF THIS HAPPENING?" IS, AT

955
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,300
LEAST IN PART, "THE POSTAL

956
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:28,200
ACCOUNTABILITY AND ENHANCEMENT

957
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:30,567
ACT OF 2006."

958
00:25:30,633 --> 00:25:32,400
BUT LOOK, BRANCHING OUT INTO

959
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:33,166
FASHION CLEARLY WON'T SAVE THE

960
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:36,734
POSTAL SERVICE.

961
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,633
THAT IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT

962
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,900
THAT THEY'RE GIVEN MORE

963
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:40,600
FLEXIBILITY, NOT JUST ON

964
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:41,467
PRICING, BUT ALSO ON THE TYPES

965
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:43,567
OF SERVICES THEY CAN OFFER.

966
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:45,500
NOW, EXPERTS SUGGEST POST

967
00:25:45,567 --> 00:25:47,033
OFFICES COULD EXPAND THEIR

968
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,242
SERVICES TO ISSUE THINGS LIKE

969
00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:49,600
HUNTING AND FISHING LICENSES.

970
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:51,667
AND PERHAPS THE BEST OPTION IS

971
00:25:51,734 --> 00:25:53,467
SOMETHING CALLED POSTAL BANKING,

972
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:54,776
WHERE THE POST OFFICE DOESN'T SO

973
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,300
MUCH ACT AS A BANK AS PROVIDE

974
00:25:57,367 --> 00:25:57,834
SOME VERY BASIC FINANCIAL

975
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,700
SERVICES, LIKE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS

976
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,467
AND CHECK CASHING.

977
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:02,767
THAT WOULDN'T JUST GENERATE

978
00:26:02,834 --> 00:26:05,066
REVENUE... IT COULD ALSO HELP

979
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:10,066
THE ESTIMATED 25% OF PEOPLE

980
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:11,633
IN THIS COUNTRY LIVING IN

981
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,367
UNBANKED OR UNDERBANKED

982
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:13,000
COMMUNITIES WHO ARE

983
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:13,633
OTHERWISE OFTEN FORCED TO TURN

984
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,467
TO ALTERNATIVE FINANCIAL

985
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:15,367
SERVICES LIKE PAYDAY LENDERS,

986
00:26:15,433 --> 00:26:16,066
WHICH CAN CHARGE UP TO 400% IN

987
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:17,400
FEES AND INTEREST.

988
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:18,609
AND THIS WOULDN'T BE COMPLETELY

989
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:21,266
OUT OF THEIR LANE.

990
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:22,700
NOT ONLY DO THEY ALREADY PROVIDE

991
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:24,767
SOME SERVICES, LIKE SELLING

992
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,800
MONEY ORDERS, MONEY TRANSFERS,

993
00:26:26,867 --> 00:26:28,266
AND PREPAID CARDS, BUT UP UNTIL

994
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:29,867
THE 1960s, THEY WERE ALREADY

995
00:26:29,934 --> 00:26:32,166
DOING IT:

996
00:26:32,233 --> 00:26:34,300
THOUGH 90% OF ITS INCOME IS

997
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:35,867
DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF STAMPS,

998
00:26:35,934 --> 00:26:36,976
THE POST OFFICE IS ALSO THE

999
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,600
LARGEST SAVINGS BANK IN THE

1000
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:39,900
COUNTRY AND THE LARGEST AGENCY

1001
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:41,367
FOR THE TRANSFER OF MONEY.

1002
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,700
IT TAKES IN MORE THAN

1003
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:43,800
$1.5 BILLION ANNUALLY.

1004
00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:45,600
John: YOU KNOW, IT'S

1005
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:47,533
DEPRESSING THAT THE WEIRDEST

1006
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,133
THING ABOUT WATCHING OLD-TIMEY

1007
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,409
CLIPS NOW ISN'T THAT THEY'RE IN

1008
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:52,166
BLACK AND WHITE OR THAT PEOPLE

1009
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:53,367
ARE WEARING HATS, IT'S THAT

1010
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:54,233
EVERYONE IS STANDING NEXT TO

1011
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,533
EACH OTHER IN A PUBLIC PLACE

1012
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,166
WITH NO FEAR OF DYING.

1013
00:26:58,233 --> 00:26:59,633
HONESTLY, AT THIS POINT, I HAVE

1014
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,934
SUCH SEVERE QUARANTINE BRAIN

1015
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,700
I COULD WAKE UP IN THE

1016
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:03,600
JURASSIC PERIOD AND MY FIRST

1017
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:07,333
THOUGHT WOULD BE "HOLY SHIT,

1018
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,300
THOSE STEGOSAURUSES ARE STANDING

1019
00:27:08,367 --> 00:27:10,233
WAY TOO CLOSE TOGETHER.

1020
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,343
BUT POSTAL BANKING IS CLEARLY

1021
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:13,300
MORE OF A LONG-TERM SOLUTION...

1022
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:13,934
IT WON'T GET THE USPS OUT OF ITS

1023
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,734
CURRENT MESS.

1024
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,033
WHAT THEY BADLY NEED IS AN

1025
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,667
INFUSION OF FUNDING AS SOON AS

1026
00:27:18,734 --> 00:27:20,166
POSSIBLE, AND NOT ONLY SHOULD WE

1027
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:22,166
BE DEMANDING THEY GET THAT,

1028
00:27:22,233 --> 00:27:23,900
CONGRESS SHOULD ALSO TAKE A LOOK

1029
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:25,500
AT UNDOING SOME OF THE MORE

1030
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:28,066
ONEROUS TERMS IN THAT 2006 LAW.

1031
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:29,767
AND UNTIL THEN, THERE MIGHT

1032
00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:32,367
ACTUALLY BE SOMETHING SMALL WE

1033
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:33,934
CAN DO HERE, BECAUSE THE

1034
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,500
PURCHASE OF STAMPS IS STILL A

1035
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:38,333
KEY REVENUE GENERATOR FOR THEM.

1036
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,500
AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET STAMPS

1037
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:42,834
MADE.

1038
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,600
TV SHOWS HAVE DONE THIS IN

1039
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:44,700
THE PAST.

1040
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:47,867
"AMERICAN IDOL" SOLD STAMPS, AND

1041
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:49,000
"VEEP" AND "FULL FRONTAL"

1042
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:49,967
RECENTLY DID GIVEAWAYS.

1043
00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:50,867
AND WHILE IT WILL NOT COME CLOSE

1044
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:53,467
TO RAISING THE $90 BILLION THE

1045
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:54,734
POSTAL SERVICE BADLY NEEDS,

1046
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,734
WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING WITH

1047
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,266

1048
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:58,433
JUST DO A GIVEAWAY, BUT TO

00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,867

00:28:10,734 --> 00:28:12,433
PERSONAL FAVORITE,

"AND NOW, A STAMP."

1059
00:28:15,133 --> 00:28:16,734
YOU CAN BUY SHEETS OF THESE FOR

1060
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,433
THE NEXT MONTH, AND I'D

1061
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,967
REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT.

THEY'RE THE PERFECT WAY TO MAIL

1063
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,400
A CARD THAT SUPPORTS THE USPS

1064
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:24,800
IN ITS TIME OF NEED WHILE

1065
00:28:24,867 --> 00:28:26,333
ALSO SAYING "I LIKE

1066
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,266
'LAST WEEK TONIGHT' AND I'M

1067
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,767
SORRY I FORGOT MOTHER'S DAY."

1068
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:31,333
WHICH YOU DID, YOU PIECE OF

1069
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
SHIT.

1070
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:34,166
IF YOU LIKED THIS SEGMENT,

1071
00:28:34,233 --> 00:28:35,033
PLEASE BUY A STAMP AND SUPPORT

1072
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,100
THE POSTAL SERVICE.

1073
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:37,276
IF YOU HATED IT, BUY ONE ANYWAY

1074
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,500
AND MAIL ME A LETTER ABOUT HOW

1075
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:41,233
MUCH I SUCK.

1076
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,467
IT'S ALL THE SAME TO THEM.

1077
00:28:43,533 --> 00:28:44,033
YOU'D BE DOING A REALLY NICE

1078
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,767
THING.

1079
00:28:44,834 --> 00:28:45,533
THAT'S OUR SHOW, THANKS SO MUCH

IT'S YOU!

I KNOW YOU!

1084
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:59,567
YOU ARE VERY GOOD AT

1085
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:00,633
INTERRUPTING THINGS.
