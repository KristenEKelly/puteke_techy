00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:30,199
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,060
Hello there,
and welcome to the show!

3
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,541
We're gonna do something
a little bit different tonight.

4
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:39,221
Our show is gonna be
about one thing,

5
00:00:39,382 --> 00:00:41,862
and you probably know what,
and you probably know why.

6
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:45,983
Protesters have continued
to fill the streets in all 50 states

7
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:49,583
in the wake of the horrific murder
of George Floyd by the police.

8
00:00:49,663 --> 00:00:51,264
In response to those protests,

9
00:00:51,344 --> 00:00:55,184
a stirring push back against
institutional racism and brutality,

10
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:58,425
it's been frankly sickening
to see them met with this.

11
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:02,786
Across the country, peaceful protests
have too often devolved into standoffs

12
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:06,346
with heavily armed police
using military-style tactics:

13
00:01:07,227 --> 00:01:12,027
flash bangs, tear gas, rubber bullets,
helicopters, armored vehicles.

14
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:15,868
We're peacefully protesting. But they
are armed like they're going to war.

15
00:01:16,508 --> 00:01:20,229
Yeah, they are. If police
are trying to convince the public

16
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:22,949
they're not guilty
of displaying excessive force,

17
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:26,310
it's probably not a good idea
to repeatedly display excessive force

18
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,991
on national television,
including in this city,

19
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:33,551
where Mayor de Blasio praised them
for their "tremendous restraint,"

20
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:36,312
and Governor Cuomo threatened
to send in the National Guard.

21
00:01:36,432 --> 00:01:40,553
Having said that I couldn't wait to go
back to hating Andrew Cuomo again,

22
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,633
I didn't think the opportunity
would come quite this soon.

23
00:01:43,753 --> 00:01:47,074
And these protestors
have received a great deal of support,

24
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:50,314
with massive marches
taking place all around the world.

25
00:01:50,434 --> 00:01:54,595
The protestors' message has taken
many forms, from chants, to signs,

26
00:01:54,755 --> 00:01:59,476
to a man who called into an LA Police
commission meeting held over Zoom.

27
00:01:59,596 --> 00:02:03,277
He had been given 30 seconds, which
he used with maximum efficiency

28
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,597
to deliver a message
for police chief Michel Moore.

29
00:02:06,077 --> 00:02:09,638
I find it disgusting that the LAPD
is slaughtering peaceful protesters.

30
00:02:09,718 --> 00:02:12,958
I had two friends go to the protests
in Beverly Hills a couple of days ago,

31
00:02:13,038 --> 00:02:15,175
and the protest was peaceful
until the police showed up

32
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,440
with their violent force, shooting
rubber bullets and throwing tear gas.

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,640
Is this what you think of protecting
and serving? I think it's bullshit.

34
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,081
Fuck you, Michel Moore. I refuse
to call you an officer or a chief,

35
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:28,881
because you don't deserve
those titles, you are a disgrace.

36
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:32,202
Suck my dick and choke on it.
I yield my time. Fuck you.

37
00:02:33,082 --> 00:02:37,443
If the president is taking notes,
that is what a perfect call looks like.

38
00:02:37,523 --> 00:02:41,043
My favorite part: after he's finished
unloading on that police chief,

39
00:02:41,123 --> 00:02:44,524
he yields his time, realizes
he still has a couple of seconds left,

40
00:02:44,604 --> 00:02:47,885
so un-yields it,
and throws in a bonus "Fuck you."

41
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:51,685
As for the president, he initially
hid from the protesters in a bunker,

42
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:55,366
later claiming he wasn't hiding,
he was just "inspecting it,"

43
00:02:55,446 --> 00:02:59,287
then his attorney general had police
gas protestors outside the White House

44
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:02,967
so that Trump could have
an inexplicable photo op at a church,

45
00:03:03,087 --> 00:03:06,888
while holding up a Bible like it's
the ticket for his sandwich order.

46
00:03:06,968 --> 00:03:10,929
In announcing job numbers on Friday,
he also invoked George Floyd's name

47
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:16,130
saying, "This was a great day for him",
which is utterly fucking disgusting.

48
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,490
But we're actually not going
to focus on Trump tonight.

49
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,691
Nor are we,
unlike some in cable news,

50
00:03:21,771 --> 00:03:24,731
gonna dwell on the incidents of looting
that occurred, except to say:

51
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:29,172
if you've said "Macy's"
more than you've said "Breonna Taylor",

52
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:31,173
you can very much fuck off.

53
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,413
If you're asking why a spontaneous,
decentralized protest

54
00:03:34,493 --> 00:03:38,134
can't control all of its participants
more than you are asking the same

55
00:03:38,214 --> 00:03:41,614
about a taxpayer funded,
heavily-regimented, paid workforce,

56
00:03:41,694 --> 00:03:44,295
you can also, in the words
of this generation's Robert Frost,

57
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,695
"Suck my dick and choke on it,
fuck you."

58
00:03:47,215 --> 00:03:51,056
Instead, tonight,
let's talk about the police.

59
00:03:51,136 --> 00:03:54,657
Because we've seen graphic videos,
which are going to be hard to watch,

60
00:03:54,737 --> 00:03:58,297
of them driving directly into crowds,
beating people with sticks,

61
00:03:58,497 --> 00:04:02,018
and sometimes assaulting the right
to assemble with speed and barbarity.

62
00:04:02,858 --> 00:04:08,059
Prematurely shooting people?
Prematurely using excessive force?

63
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:10,860
Get your scary ass on somewhere.

64
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:17,461
No, dude. Don't do that.

65
00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:26,302
What the fuck?
What the fuck did we even do?

66
00:04:27,663 --> 00:04:28,703
What the fuck?

67
00:04:29,543 --> 00:04:33,424
It's genuinely impossible
to overstate how enraging that is.

68
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:35,864
They're protesting
excessive force by police

69
00:04:35,944 --> 00:04:39,625
and the police start pepper-spraying
them like it's fucking sunscreen.

70
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:42,705
And that's just one of hundreds
and hundreds of videos.

71
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:44,082
And we're taping this
Saturday morning

72
00:04:44,106 --> 00:04:46,106
who knows what will have happened
by Sunday night?

73
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,786
Maybe they'll be using grenades,

74
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:50,547
even as "The New York Times"
weighs in with an op-ed titled,

75
00:04:50,627 --> 00:04:54,148
"Why We Need to Bring Hitler Back
to Life as a Robot Right Now."

76
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:56,908
They just think it's valuable
that you read that point of view.

77
00:04:56,988 --> 00:04:59,909
They didn't,
but they think that you really should.

78
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:04,549
For any viewers at home, shocked
by the scenes of police brutality,

79
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:06,590
I get it, I'm white too,

80
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,990
but it's worth remembering:
that's the tip of a very large iceberg.

81
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,231
It didn't start this week,
or with this president,

82
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:16,872
and it always disproportionately falls
on black communities.

83
00:05:16,952 --> 00:05:18,872
Because here are some hard facts.

84
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:21,753
In Minneapolis,
where George Floyd was murdered,

85
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:25,633
police use force against black people
at 7 times the rate of whites.

86
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:26,713
Black Americans

87
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:30,114
are 2,5 times more likely than whites
to be killed by police.

88
00:05:30,194 --> 00:05:35,515
About one in every thousand black men
can expect to be killed by police.

89
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:39,076
If you're black in America,
I can't even begin to imagine

90
00:05:39,196 --> 00:05:41,876
how scared, angry,
and exhausted you must feel.

91
00:05:41,956 --> 00:05:43,957
Not only this week,
but constantly.

92
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:47,157
Medical groups say police violence
against black and brown Americans

93
00:05:47,197 --> 00:05:49,478
is just one of many physical
and psychological factors

94
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,478
that make racism
a serious public health issue.

95
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:55,999
And look:
clearly, the police are just one part

96
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,559
of a much larger system
of racial inequality.

97
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,800
But for tonight,
we are gonna focus primarily on them,

98
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,200
and try to address
three basic questions:

99
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,161
how the fuck we got to this point,
what the obstacles to reform have been,

100
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:09,961
and what we can do going forward.

101
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:13,002
And let's start
by just acknowledging that the police

102
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:16,682
have long enjoyed an exalted role
in American society.

103
00:06:16,762 --> 00:06:20,763
In pop culture, they're the heroes
of beloved movies and TV shows like,

104
00:06:20,843 --> 00:06:24,044
"Cranky Gun Grandpa",
and "Cocaine Cops Who Fuck",

105
00:06:24,124 --> 00:06:26,484
and "Manic Bigot
and His One black Friend."

106
00:06:26,564 --> 00:06:28,124
America loves nothing more

107
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:30,965
than a renegade cop
who doesn't play by the rules.

108
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:36,646
But the reality of policing is,
and has always been, very different.

109
00:06:36,726 --> 00:06:39,166
And it might be worth going
through some of the history here,

110
00:06:39,247 --> 00:06:42,487
because it's important to understand
how deeply policing in this country

111
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:44,767
is entangled with white supremacy.

112
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:46,144
And I know you might be thinking,

113
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:48,768
"Join the club, policing.
This is America.

114
00:06:48,888 --> 00:06:50,529
Olive Garden is the only institution

115
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:53,409
not deeply entangled
with the history of white supremacy.

116
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:57,610
That's only because it's always been a
powerful symbol of white inferiority."

117
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:01,531
But the police have not
been incidentally tainted by racism.

118
00:07:01,651 --> 00:07:05,571
For much of U.S. history,
law enforcement meant enforcing laws

119
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:09,132
that were explicitly designed
to subjugate black people.

120
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:12,973
Some of America's first law enforcement
units were the slave patrols

121
00:07:13,173 --> 00:07:16,213
tasked with capturing and returning
people who'd escaped from slavery.

122
00:07:16,293 --> 00:07:19,414
When slavery ended,
white people had no intention

123
00:07:19,494 --> 00:07:21,934
of letting that
be the end of white power.

124
00:07:22,014 --> 00:07:25,175
As one Alabama planter
said in the wake of emancipation,

125
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:29,456
"We have the power to pass stringent
police laws to govern the Negroes

126
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:32,776
this is a blessing, for they
must be controlled in some way

127
00:07:32,896 --> 00:07:34,817
or white people
cannot live among them."

128
00:07:34,897 --> 00:07:36,657
And I know
that's uncomfortable to hear.

129
00:07:36,817 --> 00:07:39,297
It's certainly uncomfortable
for me to say.

130
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,178
But if we want to talk
about how we got here,

131
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:45,578
it's important to remember
that we got here on purpose.

132
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:48,939
Now, for a century after that,
police in the south were responsible

133
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:50,819
for enforcing segregation,
while allowing,

134
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:54,740
and sometimes participating,
in lynchings and anti-black terrorism.

135
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,381
And as black people migrated
to the north by the millions,

136
00:07:57,501 --> 00:08:00,461
they were met there,
yet again, by brutality.

137
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:04,542
All of this-coupled with the denial
of economic and housing opportunities,

138
00:08:04,622 --> 00:08:09,423
not always particularly subtle,
meant that, by the summer of 1967,

139
00:08:09,543 --> 00:08:13,584
there were a series of high-profile
uprisings against racial injustice

140
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:15,144
across the United States,

141
00:08:15,224 --> 00:08:18,985
or as white people describe
that exact time.

142
00:08:19,505 --> 00:08:24,466
The summer of 1967.
It is known as the "Summer of Love."

143
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:27,666
Yeah, it is known as that.

144
00:08:27,906 --> 00:08:30,227
And that's a pretty big disconnect,
isn't it?

145
00:08:30,387 --> 00:08:33,387
And it honestly makes me slightly
worried that what's happening now

146
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:37,668
will be remembered by white historians
as "The Summer of Chromatica."

147
00:08:37,748 --> 00:08:40,308
Things did not improve
from the sixties onward.

148
00:08:40,388 --> 00:08:43,029
Nixon pledged fealty to law
and order and started the war on drugs,

149
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:46,389
which Reagan later turbo-charged,
and by the time we got to the nineties,

150
00:08:46,469 --> 00:08:48,670
a school of thought
called "broken windows"

151
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,670
or "zero tolerance policing"
had started to take root,

152
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,271
which held that,
if minor crimes are left unattended,

153
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:56,391
it will lead to more serious crimes.

154
00:08:56,471 --> 00:08:59,792
Police had better crack down
on those minor offenses.

155
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:04,273
That fueled the saturation of police
in low-income communities of color

156
00:09:04,353 --> 00:09:06,713
and gave way to policies
like stop-and-frisk,

157
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:10,234
which essentially allow police officers
to search people at random.

158
00:09:10,314 --> 00:09:12,834
At that policy's peak, in 2011,

159
00:09:12,914 --> 00:09:16,075
of the nearly 700,000 stops
recorded in New York,

160
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:19,916
the vast majority
were of black and Latino people.

161
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:22,956
Or, to put that another way,
those policies, too often,

162
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:27,837
amounted to this fucking bullshit,
just under a different name.

163
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:32,158
And that sort of aggressive policing
was accompanied by constant calls

164
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,638
to increase the number
of police officers on the street.

165
00:09:34,718 --> 00:09:38,719
Let's be clear: Democrats
were very much involved in that,

166
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,080
from big-city mayors
all the way on up to this guy.

167
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,880
An initiative to put 100,000
more police officers on the street.

168
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,641
More prisons, more prevention,
100,000 more police.

169
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:55,802
100,000 new police
in communities of all sizes.

170
00:09:55,962 --> 00:10:00,323
We need to finish the job of putting
100,000 more police on our streets.

171
00:10:00,563 --> 00:10:03,083
Last fall,
Congress supported my plan to hire,

172
00:10:03,163 --> 00:10:06,404
in addition to the 100,000 community
police we've already funded,

173
00:10:06,484 --> 00:10:09,805
50,000 more-concentrated
in high crime neighborhoods.

174
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:12,645
Thanks very much for that, Congress.

175
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:15,966
100,000 police officers isn't cool.
You know what's cool?

176
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:19,206
Expanding a broken institution
to score cheap political points.

177
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:24,127
And if you can do that while playing
the saxophone, that gets even cooler.

178
00:10:24,687 --> 00:10:28,008
And all the while, as we were
continuing to boost funding for police

179
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,264
and give them more authority,

180
00:10:29,288 --> 00:10:33,089
we were simultaneously slashing
spending on key social services.

181
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:36,209
That meant that in many communities,
the police were the only ones

182
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,210
left to handle
almost any issue that people had.

183
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,331
Which is a real problem, as this former
Dallas police chief readily admits.

184
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:46,611
We're asking cops
to do too much in this country.

185
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:48,892
We're asking us to do too much.

186
00:10:48,972 --> 00:10:53,532
Every societal failure,
we put it off on the cops to solve.

187
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:58,213
Not enough mental health funding,
"Let the cop handle it."

188
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:02,534
Not enough drug addiction funding,
"Let's give it to the cops."

189
00:11:03,134 --> 00:11:05,695
Here in Dallas,
we got a loose dog problem.

190
00:11:05,895 --> 00:11:07,615
"Let's have the cops
chase loose dogs."

191
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:13,536
And he's absolutely right. We are
asking police to do far too much.

192
00:11:13,656 --> 00:11:16,817
They have a massive array of
complicated duties that, in many cases,

193
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,737
they aren't equipped to handle,

194
00:11:18,857 --> 00:11:22,018
making them very much
the Jared Kushners of local officials.

195
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:26,218
Without the expression, complexion,
general demeanor of a haunted baby.

196
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:30,499
While we should absolutely
be angry at the police right now,

197
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:33,860
let's also be angry at the series
of choices that left them

198
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,980
as essentially the only public resource
in some communities.

199
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,861
And on top of all of that,

200
00:11:39,101 --> 00:11:42,141
we've made those bad choices
even more dangerous in recent years

201
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:45,302
by needlessly arming police
to the fucking teeth.

202
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:48,102
As we discussed
six years ago now,

203
00:11:48,302 --> 00:11:51,223
we've issued the police
literal military grade equipment,

204
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:54,543
some of which you have seen used
to control and intimidate protestors.

205
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:58,224
And it's frankly not just
the hardware that's a problem here.

206
00:11:58,424 --> 00:12:00,745
Because a whole sub industry
of police training

207
00:12:00,905 --> 00:12:04,545
has also cropped up to reinforce
the message that cops are at war.

208
00:12:05,145 --> 00:12:08,226
And perhaps no one takes that idea
further than this guy.

209
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:12,027
Once you've made the decision
to take a human life,

210
00:12:13,227 --> 00:12:15,227
you're a transformed creature,
a predator.

211
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:20,708
What does a predator do?
They kill.

212
00:12:22,188 --> 00:12:25,629
Only a killer can hunt a killer.

213
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:31,350
Are you emotionally, spiritually,
psychologically prepared

214
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,471
to snuff out a human life
in defense of innocent lives?

215
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:39,031
If you can't make that decision,

216
00:12:41,672 --> 00:12:43,352
you need to find another job.

217
00:12:44,232 --> 00:12:48,233
The problem with telling someone
that they're a predator

218
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:52,154
is that it primes them to see the rest
of the world as potential prey.

219
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:55,434
And cops who went through this
training could wind up on edge.

220
00:12:55,594 --> 00:12:57,075
You wouldn't train a barber
by saying,

221
00:12:57,115 --> 00:12:58,915
"Here are your scissors
and snip like this,

222
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:01,716
and this is how to puncture
the carotid artery.

223
00:13:01,836 --> 00:13:04,516
Now, you won't need
to use this 99% of the time,

224
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:06,372
but if you don't think
you can make that decision,

225
00:13:06,396 --> 00:13:07,957
you need to find another job."

226
00:13:08,557 --> 00:13:11,877
That gross man
is actually called Dave Grossman.

227
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,358
And he calls himself
an expert in "killology,"

228
00:13:14,438 --> 00:13:16,278
a term that he invented
and defines as,

229
00:13:16,358 --> 00:13:18,999
"The scholarly study
of the destructive act,

230
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:22,959
just as sexology is the scholarly study
of the procreative act."

231
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:29,121
Which... And also, I'm pretty sure
that the first lesson in sexology is

232
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,241
"Never call sex the procreative act,

233
00:13:31,401 --> 00:13:34,922
if you want anyone to pro creatively
act with you ever again."

234
00:13:35,322 --> 00:13:36,962
As batshit as Grossman is,

235
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,882
he is by no means
a fringe figure in police culture.

236
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:43,203
He's on the road giving trainings
200 days a year.

237
00:13:43,283 --> 00:13:45,323
The officer
who shot Philando Castile

238
00:13:45,403 --> 00:13:48,644
had taken a class
based on Grossman's theories.

239
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:52,325
And when, in the wake of that shooting,
the Minneapolis mayor banned officers

240
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:54,725
from participating
in warrior-style training,

241
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:59,606
the head of the police union Bob Kroll,
announced plans to defy that decision.

242
00:13:59,686 --> 00:14:02,407
If they deem
that this training is in violation

243
00:14:02,487 --> 00:14:05,567
and they're on their own time
and they want to attend it,

244
00:14:05,727 --> 00:14:09,048
I'm gonna encourage officers to do it.
I myself will be the first one to do it.

245
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,728
If I would be disciplined,
it would never be upheld.

246
00:14:12,488 --> 00:14:14,569
I honestly don't know
what's more alarming there:

247
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:17,649
his determination to train
police officers to be predators,

248
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:19,570
his air of casual impunity,

249
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,970
or the fact that he has a sign
in his office that says

250
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,771
"Let Me Drop Everything
And Work On Your Problem."

251
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:28,331
Which is always the office
decor choice of a grade-A asshole,

252
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,812
but especially if it's someone
whose actual job

253
00:14:30,932 --> 00:14:33,012
is to work
on other people's problems.

254
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:36,053
And that confidence
that he's above punishment

255
00:14:36,253 --> 00:14:39,733
actually brings us to the second point
that we want to look at tonight:

256
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:42,374
what the major obstacles
to reform have been.

257
00:14:42,494 --> 00:14:45,374
Because one of the biggest issues
is police unions.

258
00:14:45,494 --> 00:14:49,175
Even in cities where the mayor and
police chief say all the right things,

259
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,735
it's important to know
that the union can stop

260
00:14:51,815 --> 00:14:54,576
whatever they are proposing dead
in its tracks.

261
00:14:54,656 --> 00:14:57,897
And unions can make it incredibly
difficult to discipline officers,

262
00:14:57,977 --> 00:14:59,857
even for egregious misconduct.

263
00:14:59,977 --> 00:15:02,017
Take what happened in Minneapolis,

264
00:15:02,137 --> 00:15:05,578
with two officers
who belong to our friend Bob's union.

265
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:08,378
Two Minneapolis police officers
are on paid leave

266
00:15:08,538 --> 00:15:12,059
for allegedly decorating
a Christmas tree at the 4th Precinct

267
00:15:12,219 --> 00:15:14,580
with a bunch of items
that are viewed as racist.

268
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,300
Bags of hot Taki chips,
a cup from Popeyes Fried Chicken,

269
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,821
menthol cigarettes
and cans of malt liquor...

270
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:25,982
Holy shit!
That is not just disgusting,

271
00:15:26,182 --> 00:15:29,422
it's also arguably the most racist
thing to happen to Christmas

272
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:32,983
since people decided that this child
born in the Middle East was white.

273
00:15:33,343 --> 00:15:37,224
And not only does that incident raise
serious questions about those officers,

274
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:39,864
it also implicates
the entire precinct,

275
00:15:39,944 --> 00:15:42,305
because they presumably thought
that none of their coworkers

276
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:44,265
would have a problem
with what they did.

277
00:15:44,345 --> 00:15:47,866
To his credit, when that story broke,
the mayor of Minneapolis

278
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:50,986
announced that the officers responsible
would be fired by the end of the day,

279
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:54,827
only to have to almost immediately
walk that statement back, saying

280
00:15:54,947 --> 00:15:57,747
that there was a process that they
were required to go through by law.

281
00:15:57,827 --> 00:16:02,468
We checked. Despite the fact it's been
a year and a half since that happened,

282
00:16:02,548 --> 00:16:06,349
one of those officers' cases
is still under arbitration.

283
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:10,950
I get, unions fighting for their
workers, that is what they do.

284
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,710
But police unions
take that to a dangerous extreme

285
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,791
and negotiate language into contracts
that makes removing a problem officer

286
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:19,671
incredibly difficult.

287
00:16:19,831 --> 00:16:23,112
A "Washington Post" analysis of some of
the nation's largest police departments

288
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:27,113
found that they'd fired at least
1881 officers for misconduct,

289
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:30,953
but were forced
to reinstate more than 450 of them

290
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:35,554
that's almost 25 percent, after appeals
required by their union contracts.

291
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:40,435
Police unions can also oppose even
the most basic, common-sense reform.

292
00:16:40,755 --> 00:16:45,036
A few years back, the Cleveland Police
started being required to file a report

293
00:16:45,116 --> 00:16:48,437
every time they unholstered
and pointed their gun at someone

294
00:16:48,597 --> 00:16:51,437
and their union head
was absolutely furious.

295
00:16:51,757 --> 00:16:55,278
I'm afraid that officers are gonna be
hesitant to pull their gun

296
00:16:55,358 --> 00:16:58,798
in an appropriate situation because
they don't want to do the paperwork

297
00:16:58,878 --> 00:17:01,319
that's gonna be associated
with having to pull your gun.

298
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:05,840
Okay, first:
the idea that the risk of paperwork

299
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,680
is a greater deterrent to police
officers drawing their gun

300
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,481
than the risk of killing someone
is legitimately terrifying.

301
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:13,721
And it's hard to take that
glib dismissal from anyone,

302
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:16,762
let alone someone who looks like
a boiled Mr. Potato Head

303
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:18,722
or an angry egg with a mustache.

304
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:20,802
I know those comparisons
probably make him mad,

305
00:17:20,882 --> 00:17:22,523
but what's he gonna do,
shoot me?

306
00:17:22,603 --> 00:17:25,323
I don't think so! Think of
the paperwork involved.

307
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:27,884
That attitude
is particularly hard to take

308
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:30,284
considering that
just six months previously,

309
00:17:30,364 --> 00:17:33,965
Tamir Rice had been killed
by a Cleveland police officer.

310
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:36,925
When faced with accountability
that they don't like,

311
00:17:37,045 --> 00:17:39,486
unions will often issue
the ultimate threat

312
00:17:39,566 --> 00:17:42,326
to simply pull back
and let crime rise.

313
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:46,367
Listen to how the head
of New York City's largest police union

314
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:48,887
reacted when a judge
recommended firing the officer

315
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,608
whose chokehold led
to the death of Eric Garner.

316
00:17:51,888 --> 00:17:54,728
The criminal advocates
have gotten what they want.

317
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:57,369
The police department is frozen.

318
00:17:58,249 --> 00:18:01,010
The police department
can't stop the killers,

319
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:05,250
they can't stop the criminals,
they can't effectively do their job.

320
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,771
I'm sorry to say that we have
to tell our police officers:

321
00:18:09,971 --> 00:18:11,572
"Take it a step slower."

322
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:16,172
"Take it a step slower."
He just basically threatened

323
00:18:16,252 --> 00:18:19,493
inaction against "the killers"
as a bargaining chip.

324
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:21,973
And besides that
being morally reprehensible,

325
00:18:22,093 --> 00:18:26,454
it is a tool that most labor unions
don't have at their disposal.

326
00:18:26,614 --> 00:18:29,535
When the unions representing TV
writers fight for their members,

327
00:18:29,615 --> 00:18:31,431
the worst thing that they
can threaten the public with

328
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:35,536
is fewer episodes of "Bull",
or "The Blacklist" or this show.

329
00:18:35,896 --> 00:18:38,176
That's just not
a compelling argument.

330
00:18:38,656 --> 00:18:41,897
That wasn't even an empty threat,
because following that statement,

331
00:18:41,977 --> 00:18:44,978
policing did slow down in New York
for a bit last year.

332
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:47,498
There was an 11 percent
drop in felony arrests,

333
00:18:47,578 --> 00:18:50,018
an 18 percent drop
in misdemeanor arrests

334
00:18:50,098 --> 00:18:53,219
and a 32 percent drop
in moving violations.

335
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:55,940
But the thing is,
if you lived in New York then,

336
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,500
you probably don't remember it as
the time the city devolved into chaos.

337
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,021
Because it didn't. People still
went about their lives,

338
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,941
subways were still as delayed
as they usually were

339
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:09,982
and rats still dragged slices of pizza
up stairs to feed their rat families

340
00:19:10,102 --> 00:19:11,742
after a hard day of rat work,

341
00:19:11,982 --> 00:19:14,463
making you wonder
whether all those arrests

342
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,423
were really in the interest
of public safety at all.

343
00:19:17,944 --> 00:19:22,944
One good way to attempt to get
reforms past a union's resistance

344
00:19:23,064 --> 00:19:25,185
is if the federal government
steps in.

345
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:28,946
Which it actually can. It has the power
to investigate police departments

346
00:19:29,026 --> 00:19:31,026
for a pattern
of civil rights violations

347
00:19:31,106 --> 00:19:33,826
and enter
what is called a "consent decree",

348
00:19:33,986 --> 00:19:36,987
in which the police department agrees
to make institutional changes

349
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:39,667
that are then overseen
by a federal court.

350
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:42,628
That can be a powerful tool
to force change.

351
00:19:42,788 --> 00:19:46,669
That paperwork requirement
in Cleveland that pissed off this egg,

352
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:49,189
that came from a consent decree.

353
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:52,950
The problem is, how or even
whether the government does that

354
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,430
depends on who is running it.

355
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:58,191
And right now, it's this wildly
unsuccessful Bible salesman.

356
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:01,471
And he clearly has no interest
in police reform.

357
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,872
In George W. Bush's first term,
his Justice Department launched

358
00:20:04,952 --> 00:20:07,713
12 such investigations
into police departments.

359
00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:10,113
In Obama's first term,
it was 15.

360
00:20:10,313 --> 00:20:13,594
Trump's DOJ has launched
just a single investigation

361
00:20:13,794 --> 00:20:16,514
and has entered
zero consent decrees.

362
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:21,555
Trump has made it clear where
he stands on the police use of force.

363
00:20:21,715 --> 00:20:23,035
He not only rolled back

364
00:20:23,115 --> 00:20:25,716
Obama's restrictions on giving
the police military equipment,

365
00:20:25,796 --> 00:20:29,556
listen to what he said to an audience
filled with law enforcement.

366
00:20:30,077 --> 00:20:32,197
Please don't be too nice.

367
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:35,758
Like when you guys put
somebody in the car

368
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:39,678
and you're protecting their head,
the way you put the hand over it.

369
00:20:40,318 --> 00:20:43,679
Like, don't hit their head,
and they've just killed somebody.

370
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,320
Don't hit their head. I said:
"You can take the hand away, okay?"

371
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:57,001
It's bad enough when it's just
a bunch of random shitheads

372
00:20:57,081 --> 00:20:58,882
cheering
on Trump's lawless rhetoric.

373
00:20:58,962 --> 00:21:01,242
It's a lot more alarming
when that applause is coming

374
00:21:01,322 --> 00:21:04,923
from the people whose main job
is to see lawlessness and stop it.

375
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:08,604
So, if the unions won't act
and the federal government won't act,

376
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,524
what else can you do as a civilian

377
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,604
to get accountability
if the police violated your rights?

378
00:21:13,724 --> 00:21:18,525
You could try and sue the city
or the individual officer in question.

379
00:21:18,605 --> 00:21:20,806
In high-profile cases especially,

380
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:24,326
they can be incentivized to settle
for astonishing amounts.

381
00:21:24,606 --> 00:21:26,807
In fact,
over a period of five years,

382
00:21:27,007 --> 00:21:29,847
the 10 cities with the largest
police departments paid out

383
00:21:29,927 --> 00:21:33,088
a billion dollars in settlements
and court judgments.

384
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:36,409
I'm no comptroller.
Believe me, I wish I were.

385
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:39,809
A hard-to-explain, lethally boring,
elected accountant

386
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:43,730
whose title took a real word and
stuck an "mp" in the middle of it?

387
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,810
Come on!
That's my dream jompb.

388
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,411
Even I can tell you,

389
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:50,331
if you're spending a billion dollars
on misconduct settlements,

390
00:21:50,451 --> 00:21:53,772
you might want to seriously
examine what conduct looks like.

391
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:56,732
And if a city doesn't feel
that it has to settle with you,

392
00:21:56,852 --> 00:21:58,212
you're in real trouble,

393
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:01,653
because civil suits against cops
are nearly impossible to win.

394
00:22:01,773 --> 00:22:04,254
Listen to a defense attorney
explain one reason

395
00:22:04,334 --> 00:22:06,654
that it was gonna be difficult
for Michael Brown's family

396
00:22:06,774 --> 00:22:09,094
to sue the Ferguson officer
who killed him.

397
00:22:09,214 --> 00:22:11,295
Civilly, sure,
they could go after him civilly.

398
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,455
The problem is
he has qualified immunity.

399
00:22:13,575 --> 00:22:17,256
He's gonna say that "I was acting
within the scope of my employment."

400
00:22:17,616 --> 00:22:19,576
Yeah, and he is right about that.

401
00:22:19,696 --> 00:22:22,137
Police officers are often protected
from consequences

402
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:24,937
due to something called
qualified immunity,

403
00:22:25,097 --> 00:22:27,858
which sounds like something
you'd get from a horrifying cheat code

404
00:22:27,938 --> 00:22:29,018
in "Grand Theft Auto".

405
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:32,939
I turned on qualified immunity
and now my car runs on prostitutes!

406
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:36,659
But it's actually worth taking
a moment to talk about that term.

407
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:39,500
Very basically,
qualified immunity means

408
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,220
that a public official is immune
from lawsuits,

409
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,381
unless their exact conduct

410
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:47,821
has already been ruled unconstitutional
in a previous case.

411
00:22:47,941 --> 00:22:49,422
And I do mean exact.

412
00:22:49,662 --> 00:22:53,983
Because small, tiny variations can
result in the case being thrown out.

413
00:22:54,063 --> 00:22:55,703
This happens all the time.

414
00:22:55,943 --> 00:22:58,583
One case was thrown out
because of the difference between

415
00:22:58,703 --> 00:23:02,584
unleashing a police dog to bite
a motionless suspect in a bushy ravine

416
00:23:02,784 --> 00:23:04,424
and unleashing a police dog

417
00:23:04,544 --> 00:23:07,705
to bite a compliant suspect
in a canal in the woods.

418
00:23:07,785 --> 00:23:12,266
Which I totally get, those are two
different kinds of outdoor holes.

419
00:23:12,786 --> 00:23:14,426
And then, there was this case.

420
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:18,467
A federal appeals court has ruled
Seattle Police used excessive force

421
00:23:18,587 --> 00:23:22,548
when they tasered a pregnant
woman during a traffic stop in 2004.

422
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:25,028
She was shocked three times
with a stun gun

423
00:23:25,268 --> 00:23:27,469
for refusing
to sign a speeding ticket.

424
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:29,949
Although the ruling was
in Brooks' favor,

425
00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:32,510
the officer who fired the Taser
was given immunity

426
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,710
because the law on stun gun use
was not clear yet.

427
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:40,671
That is absolutely ridiculous.
The method the officer used

428
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:43,271
to assault that woman
clearly shouldn't matter.

429
00:23:43,391 --> 00:23:45,632
It's like if Jeffrey Dahmer
was declared innocent

430
00:23:45,712 --> 00:23:48,112
because he cooked his victims
in an Instant Pot.

431
00:23:48,272 --> 00:23:51,793
The crime is the killing, not what
fucking appliance he used.

432
00:23:52,313 --> 00:23:55,314
Now, the good news is there
is a chance that the Supreme Court

433
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:58,234
will soon decide to reconsider
qualified immunity.

434
00:23:58,314 --> 00:24:01,595
There's actually a bill in Congress
right now to abolish it.

435
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:05,916
Even if it passes, it may have to wait
for a new president to sign it.

436
00:24:06,036 --> 00:24:09,756
We may not get one of those anywhere
from the next four years to never.

437
00:24:10,156 --> 00:24:13,037
But while ending qualified
immunity would be great,

438
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:15,597
that alone
isn't gonna be nearly enough.

439
00:24:15,797 --> 00:24:20,198
And that brings us to our final point,
here: what do we do now?

440
00:24:20,678 --> 00:24:22,959
There are a lot
of suggestions to look at.

441
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,279
Unfortunately,
some prominent Democrats

442
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:28,680
have been spitballing ideas
that are embarrassingly small.

443
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,240
And perhaps none
more ridiculous than this.

444
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,121
The idea that instead of standing
there and teaching a cop

445
00:24:36,201 --> 00:24:39,042
when there's an unarmed person
comin' at 'em with a knife

446
00:24:39,122 --> 00:24:42,442
to shoot 'em in the leg instead
of the heart is a very different thing.

447
00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:45,563
There's a lot of different things
that can change.

448
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:50,084
That lack of imagination
is not particularly inspiring,

449
00:24:50,164 --> 00:24:53,404
but also not particularly
surprising coming from Joe Biden,

450
00:24:53,484 --> 00:24:57,445
who is the "getting shot in the leg
instead of the heart" candidate now.

451
00:24:57,845 --> 00:25:01,606
While that's obviously absurd,
the instinct that Biden displayed,

452
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:05,646
that the key question is not
if an officer should shoot someone,

453
00:25:05,726 --> 00:25:08,887
but where,
is shared by many politicians.

454
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,248
In New York, Bill de Blasio
has balked at making it illegal

455
00:25:12,328 --> 00:25:15,448
for police to use chokeholds,
despite the fact that a chokehold

456
00:25:15,528 --> 00:25:18,209
is precisely what led
to the death of Eric Garner.

457
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:21,809
But the fact is, the incremental
reforms that we've tried,

458
00:25:21,969 --> 00:25:23,770
like the wider use of body cameras

459
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,130
and implicit bias
and use-of-force training,

460
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,690
are not, on their own,
going to cut it.

461
00:25:29,211 --> 00:25:32,051
I'm not saying
that we shouldn't still try them,

462
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:35,572
but in many cases you are contending
with an entrenched police culture

463
00:25:35,692 --> 00:25:38,132
resistant to any effort
to compel reform.

464
00:25:38,292 --> 00:25:42,853
That is why many are advocating
we rethink police from the ground up.

465
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:45,494
One small example of this
is Camden, New Jersey,

466
00:25:45,614 --> 00:25:47,134
which 10 years ago was policed

467
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,014
by a deeply troubled,
corruption-ridden force.

468
00:25:50,294 --> 00:25:55,295
But in 2013, they dissolved
their city police force entirely,

469
00:25:55,535 --> 00:25:58,296
with officers having to reapply
for their jobs.

470
00:25:58,416 --> 00:26:01,696
And in doing that, they've been able
to meaningfully shift the culture,

471
00:26:01,776 --> 00:26:03,897
while also instituting policy changes

472
00:26:03,977 --> 00:26:06,537
that have led to both a drop
in excessive force complaints

473
00:26:06,657 --> 00:26:09,298
and some re-building
of community trust.

474
00:26:09,498 --> 00:26:12,618
I'm not saying
that it's been easy, perfect

475
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:14,539
or even
that it would work everywhere.

476
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:18,419
But, it should expand
our idea of what is possible.

477
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,500
One even broader idea
that's gaining momentum right now

478
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,140
is defunding the police.

479
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,781
That's a phrase that, on its face,
may sound alarming to some.

480
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:31,862
Just watch this professional alarmist
be alarmed on his very bad face.

481
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:36,103
Defund the police. No more cops.
That's what they're fighting for.

482
00:26:36,743 --> 00:26:40,543
Seems like a fringe position, but in
the Democratic Party, it isn't anymore.

483
00:26:40,703 --> 00:26:44,344
If you live in a gated community,
it might sound like a good idea.

484
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:46,785
You've got your own police force.

485
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:51,665
You have no plans to replace them
with rapid response social workers.

486
00:26:51,866 --> 00:26:53,466
So, you're set
no matter what happens.

487
00:26:53,546 --> 00:26:56,106
There aren't gonna be any rapes
on your street.

488
00:26:56,186 --> 00:26:59,627
But what about everyone else?
What's gonna happen to them?

489
00:27:00,307 --> 00:27:04,028
Okay. First of all, in all sincerity,
Tucker, you seem nervous.

490
00:27:04,468 --> 00:27:08,108
This is a difficult moment and I hope
that you're taking time for yourself,

491
00:27:08,188 --> 00:27:12,029
and whether it's through meditation
or yoga, or just kidding...

492
00:27:12,109 --> 00:27:15,590
Fuck you forever, Tucker Carlson,
you sentient polo mallet.

493
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,990
Second, given the shockingly
low number of rape cases

494
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,951
that actually result in charges,
much less, convictions,

495
00:27:22,031 --> 00:27:26,512
I wouldn't be holding that up as proof
that our system is working well.

496
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:30,833
And finally: defunding the police
absolutely does not mean

497
00:27:30,953 --> 00:27:34,513
that we eliminate all cops
and just succumb to "The Purge".

498
00:27:34,673 --> 00:27:39,434
It's about moving away from
a narrow conception of public safety

499
00:27:39,554 --> 00:27:41,474
that relies on policing
and punishment,

500
00:27:41,554 --> 00:27:44,835
and investing in a community's
actual safety net,

501
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,516
things like stable housing,
mental health services

502
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:49,356
and community organizations.

503
00:27:49,436 --> 00:27:53,117
The concept is that the role
of the police can then shrink,

504
00:27:53,277 --> 00:27:55,597
because they are not
responding to the homeless,

505
00:27:55,677 --> 00:27:59,278
or to mental health calls,
or arresting children in schools,

506
00:27:59,358 --> 00:28:02,038
or really any other situation
where the best solution

507
00:28:02,118 --> 00:28:04,159
is not someone
showing up with a gun.

508
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:07,359
That is the idea
behind "defund the police",

509
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:09,159
if you actually listen to it.

510
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:12,520
Tucker Carlson
has the exact level of understanding

511
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,081
about the Black Lives Matter movement
that you would expect

512
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:18,081
from a man who always looks like
he just saw his first black Barbie

513
00:28:18,161 --> 00:28:20,361
and feels confused,
but mostly scared.

514
00:28:21,042 --> 00:28:26,323
As we know, many police will likely
resist any redistribution, hard.

515
00:28:26,643 --> 00:28:29,003
Police unions often
paint themselves as essential

516
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,483
and everything else
as somehow frivolous.

517
00:28:31,604 --> 00:28:34,964
Remember Bob Kroll?
When Minneapolis asked his union

518
00:28:35,044 --> 00:28:38,805
to accept a pay freeze due
to Covid-19, here is how he reacted.

519
00:28:39,405 --> 00:28:43,766
The first thing we said was:
"Okay, let's see the city budget".

520
00:28:44,326 --> 00:28:49,247
They're pissing away millions
and millions of dollars to projects.

521
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,927
They're giving $15 000 a year

522
00:28:52,007 --> 00:28:54,688
to the transgender coordinator
for the city.

523
00:28:55,328 --> 00:28:59,369
Let's set aside the risks of violence
against transgender people,

524
00:28:59,449 --> 00:29:01,489
particualrly trans women of color.

525
00:29:01,569 --> 00:29:04,970
And instead, consider that the budget
for the Minneapolis Police Department

526
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:08,730
is $193 million,
meaning that 15 000

527
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:13,211
amounts to 0.008 percent
of their annual budget.

528
00:29:13,371 --> 00:29:15,091
If that's pissing money away,

529
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,812
the city should really
see a fucking urologist.

530
00:29:18,012 --> 00:29:22,093
But guys like Bob rolling his eyes
at anything transgender-related

531
00:29:22,173 --> 00:29:25,093
is exactly why it is time for
our conversation to go

532
00:29:25,173 --> 00:29:27,254
beyond "How should
the police do their jobs?"

533
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:30,654
to "What, really, do we
want the role of the police to be?"

534
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:36,015
Too many still seem to think that
this is an issue of a few bad actors.

535
00:29:36,335 --> 00:29:40,496
Listen to one officer unsuccessfully
try to make that argument

536
00:29:40,576 --> 00:29:42,496
to some protestors just this week.

537
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:46,897
One bad hamburger at McDonald's
does not make McDonald's bad.

538
00:29:47,617 --> 00:29:49,298
What the fuck does that mean?

539
00:29:49,738 --> 00:29:53,578
That protestor's right.
What the fuck does that mean?

540
00:29:54,018 --> 00:29:56,499
One hamburger
should mean a health inspection.

541
00:29:56,619 --> 00:29:59,459
A few bad hamburgers might mean
McDonald's getting shut down.

542
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:02,300
And bad hamburgers
regularly killing people on the street

543
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,380
would mean that we'd maybe
all consider going fucking vegan.

544
00:30:05,901 --> 00:30:08,901
This clearly
isn't about individual officers,

545
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:12,302
it's about a structure built
on systemic racism

546
00:30:12,462 --> 00:30:17,583
that this country created intentionally
and now needs to dismantle and replace

547
00:30:17,663 --> 00:30:21,503
with one that takes into account
the needs of the people that it serves.

548
00:30:21,663 --> 00:30:24,504
And this is gonna take sustained
pressure and attention

549
00:30:24,584 --> 00:30:27,584
over a long period of time,
from all of us.

550
00:30:28,105 --> 00:30:31,145
Black communities
have had to be perpetual activists

551
00:30:31,265 --> 00:30:33,986
while also
routinely being disenfranchised.

552
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:36,466
And it is long past time
that the rest of us joined

553
00:30:36,546 --> 00:30:39,627
to make sure that their voices
are heard and acted upon.

554
00:30:40,227 --> 00:30:44,868
'Cause it's gonna be far too easy for
nothing to meaningfully change here.

555
00:30:45,228 --> 00:30:47,508
That is what
has always happened before.

556
00:30:47,868 --> 00:30:50,029
After the unrest
in the late sixties,

557
00:30:50,189 --> 00:30:53,669
a commission was set up
to investigate and issue advice.

558
00:30:53,749 --> 00:30:57,710
Many of its conclusions resemble ideas,
like police demilitarization

559
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,390
and broad reinvestment
in marginalized communities,

560
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,351
that are still being pushed today.

561
00:31:02,431 --> 00:31:05,751
Testifying before that commission
was the social scientist Kenneth Clark.

562
00:31:05,871 --> 00:31:09,152
He made this observation,
which remains depressingly true.

563
00:31:09,232 --> 00:31:12,953
He said: "I read the report
of the 1919 riot in Chicago,"

564
00:31:13,193 --> 00:31:14,849
"and it is as if I were reading
the report"

565
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,914
"of the investigating committee
of the Harlem riot of 1935,"

566
00:31:17,994 --> 00:31:21,314
"the report of the investigating
committee of the Harlem riot of 1943,"

567
00:31:21,394 --> 00:31:25,075
"the report of the McCone Commission
of the Watts riot of 1965."

568
00:31:25,275 --> 00:31:27,395
"I must again in candor
say to you..."

569
00:31:27,475 --> 00:31:30,756
"It is a kind of Alice in Wonderland
with the same moving picture"

570
00:31:30,836 --> 00:31:33,716
"reshown over and over again,
the same analysis,"

571
00:31:33,876 --> 00:31:36,917
"the same recommendations
and the same inaction."

572
00:31:37,717 --> 00:31:41,358
We're in the same shit now
that we were in back then.

573
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:44,318
And if you're not
directly impacted by it,

574
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:47,719
it is tempting to look for a reason
to feel better about the world.

575
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:51,520
To look at cops kneeling and think:
"Well we just need more of that!"

576
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,400
But we need so much
more than that.

577
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,121
Because ours
is a firmly entrenched system

578
00:31:58,361 --> 00:32:01,201
in which the roots
of white supremacy run deep.

579
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:04,682
And it is critical that
we all grab a fucking shovel.

580
00:32:05,242 --> 00:32:08,403
To do anything less
would be absolutely unforgivable.

581
00:32:09,243 --> 00:32:12,723
And actually, to that point,
there is one person I saw this week

582
00:32:13,444 --> 00:32:15,964
whose words have been echoing
around my head.

583
00:32:16,044 --> 00:32:18,404
And you've been listening
to me talk for a while.

584
00:32:18,484 --> 00:32:21,445
I'm gonna let her have
the last word tonight.

585
00:32:22,165 --> 00:32:25,006
When they say: "Why do you
burn down the community?"

586
00:32:25,086 --> 00:32:26,966
"Why do you burn down
your own neighborhood?"

587
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:29,967
It's not ours!
We don't own anything.

588
00:32:31,727 --> 00:32:33,127
We don't own anything.

589
00:32:34,127 --> 00:32:37,248
Trevor Noah said it
so beautifully last night.

590
00:32:37,608 --> 00:32:41,609
There's a social contract we all
have, that if you steal or if I steal,

591
00:32:41,729 --> 00:32:46,250
then the person who is the authority
comes in and they fix the situation.

592
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:49,330
But the person who fixes
the situation is killing us.

593
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:55,651
So, the social contract is broken.
And if the social contract is broken,

594
00:32:55,771 --> 00:32:58,012
why the fuck do I give a shit
about burning

595
00:32:58,092 --> 00:33:01,772
the fucking Football Hall of Fame,
about burning a fucking Target?

596
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:03,253
You broke the contract

597
00:33:03,653 --> 00:33:05,973
when you killed us in the streets
and didn't give a fuck!

598
00:33:07,213 --> 00:33:09,254
You broke
the contract for 400 years.

599
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:11,494
We played your game
and built your wealth.

600
00:33:12,294 --> 00:33:14,775
You broke the contract
when we built our wealth, again,

601
00:33:14,855 --> 00:33:19,335
on our own by our bootstraps in
Tulsa and you dropped bombs on us.

602
00:33:19,936 --> 00:33:21,536
When we built it in Rosewood

603
00:33:21,696 --> 00:33:23,816
and you came in
and you slaughtered us.

604
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,817
You broke the contract,
so fuck your Target.

605
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:29,777
Fuck your Hall of Fame.

606
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:35,538
As far as I'm concerned, they
can burn this bitch to the ground

607
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:38,099
and it still wouldn't be enough.

608
00:33:38,379 --> 00:33:39,499
And they are lucky

609
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:42,820
that what black people are looking for
is equality and not revenge.

610
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,060
That's our show. Thanks for watching.
Good night.
