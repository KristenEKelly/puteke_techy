1
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:33,280
HI THERE, WELCOME TO

2
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:34,235
THE SHOW.

3
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:35,539
STILL TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,085
VOID.

5
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:37,055
WHICH, FUN FACT, IS ACTUALLY

6
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,055
JUST A ZOOMED-IN PICTURE OF THIS

7
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,226
"I VOTED" STICKER.

8
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,085
WHICH IS GREAT!

9
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:43,125
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT STICKER IS

10
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:44,085
ATTACHED TO JAMES WOODS, WHICH

11
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:46,036
IS VERY MUCH NOT.

12
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,015
AND OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE GOING TO

13
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,036
START WITH OUR MAIN STORY

14
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,226
TONIGHT, WHICH IS THE 2020

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,265
ELECTION, OR AS IT'S KNOWN FOR

16
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:53,125
HORSES, "JUST ANOTHER WEEK."

17
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:54,165
LOOK AT THEM.

18
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:55,186
THEY'VE GOT NO CLUE.

19
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:00,106
HOT IDIOTS.

20
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,006
THIS WAS CLEARLY A VERY LONG,

21
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,085
VERY TENSE WEEK, ALTHOUGH

22
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:06,176
THANKFULLY, IT ALL FELT WORTH IT

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,185
DUE TO HOW IT ENDED.

24
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:08,165
CNN PROJECTS

25
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:10,085
JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR. IS ELECTED

26
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:12,036
THE 46TH PRESIDENT OF THE

27
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,135
UNITED STATES, WINNING

28
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:15,066
THE WHITE HOUSE AND DENYING

29
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,055
PRESIDENT TRUMP A SECOND TERM.

30
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:19,036
YEAH!

31
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,289
THAT DEFINITELY HAPPENED.

32
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,015
TRUMP ISN'T GOING TO BE

33
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:24,319
PRESIDENT ANYMORE... SOMETHING I

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,045
PERSONALLY LEARNED FROM NO LESS

35
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:27,085
THAN 20 TEXT MESSAGES FROM MY

36
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:29,186
FRIENDS AND FAMILY ALL SAYING

37
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,156
"IT'S OVER!"

38
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,085
WHICH, IN THIS SITUATION, WAS

39
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:32,349
WELCOME, BUT ON ANY REGULAR DAY

40
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,025
WOULD TERRIFY THE LIVING SHIT

41
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,996
OUT OF ME.

42
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,025
AS WE ARE TAPING THIS ON

43
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:40,195
SATURDAY, PEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA

44
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:41,459
ARE STILL TAKING TO THE STREETS

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,135
TO CELEBRATE NOT JUST THAT BIDEN

46
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,186
AND HARRIS WERE ELECTED, BUT YOU

47
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,075
SENSED, MAINLY, THAT A CERTAIN

48
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:47,246
SOMEONE WAS ABOUT TO GET EVICTED

49
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,126
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

50
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,239
FUCK DONALD TRUMP!

51
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,156
YOU KNOW WHAT?

52
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,086
THAT PERSON SCREAMING

53
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,066
"FUCK DONALD TRUMP" FROM THE

54
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,045
BACK OF A MOVING SCOOTER

55
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:19,265
ACTUALLY SUMS UP PRETTY

56
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:20,226
NICELY HOW A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL

57
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,096
RIGHT NOW.

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,156
AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, IT WAS

59
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,156
LIKE THAT ALL DAY HERE IN

60
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,235
NEW YORK.

61
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:26,115
THERE WAS A MOOD HERE THAT

62
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:27,015
CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A

63
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:27,265
"REVERSE 9/11."

64
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:28,126
WHY?

65
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,235
BECAUSE IT COMBINED COMPLETE

66
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:31,045
EUPHORIA, AN ABIDING DISGUST FOR

67
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,036
RUDY GIULIANI, AND THIS TIME,

68
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,086
PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY DANCING ON

69
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:36,036
ROOFTOPS IN NEW JERSEY.

70
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,115
IT WAS A REALLY GOOD DAY.

71
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:39,265
NEVER FORGET.

72
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:40,265
IT IS GENUINELY HARD TO

73
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:42,105
OVERSTATE THE LEVEL OF RELIEF

74
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,186
THAT HAS BEEN FLYING AROUND

75
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,055
PARTS OF THIS COUNTRY,

76
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,186
ESPECIALLY AT THE END OF A TRULY

77
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,006
DRAINING WEEK.

78
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,135
AND TONIGHT WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT

79
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,226
BE WORTH MAPPING EXACTLY HOW WE

80
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,055
GOT TO THIS POINT OVER THE LAST

81
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,126
SEVEN DAYS, BECAUSE AT THE START

82
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,390
OF THIS WEEK, WE ALL KNEW THAT,

83
00:02:58,009 --> 00:02:58,146
DUE TO THE PANDEMIC, THIS

84
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,096
ELECTION WAS GOING TO BE

85
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,126
DIFFERENT.

86
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,126
CRUCIALLY, THAT IT WAS GOING TO

87
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,026
REQUIRE MORE PATIENCE THAN

88
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,186
USUAL.

89
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,045
YET FOR SOME REASON, AS SOON AS

90
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:06,226
TUESDAY CAME AROUND, EVERYONE

91
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,015
SEEMED TO IMMEDIATELY FORGET

92
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,165
THAT, BECAUSE STARTING THAT

93
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,186
EVENING, ALMOST EVERY NEWS

94
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,370
CHANNEL WAS OVERTAKEN BY SOME

95
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:13,246
VERSION OF A GUY PLAYING WITH A

96
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,036
BIG SCREEN WHILE SOMEONE COMES

97
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,226
IN TO INTERRUPT AND PESTER THEM

98
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,026
WITH QUESTIONS.

99
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,195
IT WAS BASICALLY THE EQUIVALENT

100
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:20,226
OF WATCHING THE SECURITY FOOTAGE

101
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,096
AT A BEST BUY FOR FOUR STRAIGHT

102
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,055
DAYS.

103
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,026
AND WHILE NEWS OUTLETS TRIED

104
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,256
THEIR BEST TO BE PATIENT, AS

105
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,175
THINGS DRAGGED ON, IT WAS CLEAR

106
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,055
THEY JUST COULDN'T DO IT...

107
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,036
SOMETHING PERHAPS BEST SUMMED UP

108
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,006
BY THIS EXCHANGE BETWEEN

109
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,156
DON LEMON AND A PHILADELPHIA

110
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:36,280
CITY COMMISSIONER.

111
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,265
SO HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT'S

112
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:39,026
GOING TO TAKE TO COUNT ALL THE

113
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:39,256
VOTES, COMMISSIONER?

114
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,115
YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING

115
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:43,026
HEARING REPORTERS TALK ABOUT,

116
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,186
"LISTEN, EVERYBODY, THIS IS

117
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,156
GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME," AND

118
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,186
THEN THE POLLS CLOSE AND THEN

119
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,026
IT'S, "WHY DON'T YOU HAVE THE

120
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,175
RESULTS YET?"

121
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,135
SO EVERYONE NEEDS TO RECALIBRATE

122
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,096
THEIR EXPECTATIONS.

123
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,175
I RESEMBLE THAT REMARK.

124
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,996
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.

125
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,096
SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS THEN,

126
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,026
SPEAKING OF... THAT WAS A GOOD

127
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,006
ANSWER.

128
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,075
BUT ARE YOU TALKING HOURS, ARE

129
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:08,226
YOU TALKING DAYS?

130
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,996
HE DOESN'T FUCKING

131
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,186
KNOW, LEMON!

132
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,235
LEAVE THE MAN ALONE!

133
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:13,379
AT THAT POINT, IT WOULD HAVE

134
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:14,280
BEEN JUST AS PRODUCTIVE TO ASK

135
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,086
HIM, "WHEN WILL PENGUINS LEARN

136
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,096
HOW TO FLY?"

137
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,216
OR "WHEN IS MICHAEL KEATON GOING

138
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,266
TO WIN AN OSCAR?"

139
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,156
OR, "WHAT DOES THE REST OF THE

140
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,216
PRINGLES GUY'S BODY LOOK LIKE?

141
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,196
IS HE TALL OR SHORT?

142
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,115
DOES HE HAVE A LOT OF BODY HAIR

143
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,226
OR IS HE COMPLETELY SMOOTH?

144
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,216
WHEN WILL YOU BE ABLE TO TELL ME

145
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,005
WHAT HIS NIPPLES LOOK LIKE?

146
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:28,290
ARE YOU TALKING HOURS, OR ARE

147
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:30,196
YOU TALKING DAYS?"

148
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,026
WHAT WAS ALSO ENTIRELY

149
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,216
PREDICTABLE WAS HOW TRUMP WAS

150
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,105
GOING TO REACT AS THE COUNT

151
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:37,206
SLOWLY UNFOLDED, BECAUSE LONG

152
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,175
BEFORE RESULTS WERE IN, HE TOOK

153
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,036
ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT HE

154
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,135
WAS AHEAD IN SOME STATES TO

155
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:44,135
DECLARE A PREMATURE, COMPLETELY

156
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,156
UNFOUNDED VICTORY.

157
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,165
AT 2:30 A.M. ON WEDNESDAY, HE

158
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:49,156
DELIVERED THIS NIGHTMARISH

159
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,146
SPEECH FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

160
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,196
THIS IS A FRAUD ON THE

161
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,086
AMERICAN PUBLIC.

162
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,026
THIS IS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO OUR

163
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,105
COUNTRY.

164
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:01,045
WE WERE GETTING READY TO WIN

165
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:02,279
THIS ELECTION.

166
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,105
FRANKLY, WE DID WIN THIS

167
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:07,266
ELECTION.

168
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,450
SO WE'LL BE GOING TO THE U.S.

169
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,196
SUPREME COURT.

170
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,036
WE WANT ALL VOTING TO STOP.

171
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,245
WE DON'T WANT THEM TO FIND ANY

172
00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:19,226
BALLOTS AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING

173
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,185
AND ADD THEM TO THE LIST.

174
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:24,206
OKAY?

175
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,055
UH, NO.

176
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:30,156
IT'S NOT OKAY.

177
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,105
IT'S NOT OKAY AT ALL.

178
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:32,096
FOR A START, YOU CAN'T

179
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,255
JUST THREATEN TO GO TO THE

180
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,235
SUPREME COURT WHEN THINGS AREN'T

181
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:34,055
GOING YOUR WAY.

182
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,235
IT'S THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE

183
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:35,115
LAND, NOT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL

184
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:35,255
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE.

185
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,235
AND SECOND, THEY WEREN'T

186
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:37,146
"FINDING" BALLOTS, THEY WERE

187
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,266
COUNTING THEM.

188
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,016
AND COUNTING AND FINDING ARE NOT

189
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,279
THE SAME THING.

190
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,279
THAT'S WHY THE MOVIE

191
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,096
"FINDING NEMO" WASN'T CALLED

192
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,146
"COUNTING NEMO."

193
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,086
'CAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A

194
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,115
VERY DIFFERENT AND MUCH SHORTER

195
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,016
MOVIE.

196
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,005
ONE NEMO.

197
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:50,290
THE END.

198
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:52,096
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT PRESS

199
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,226
CONFERENCE SET THE TONE FOR THE

200
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,266
REST OF THE WEEK, WITH THE

201
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,096
SOON-TO-BE-FORMER PRESIDENT AND

202
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,045
HIS CAMP DOING ABSOLUTELY

203
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:00,185
EVERYTHING THEY COULD

204
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:01,076
THINK OF TO SUBVERT THIS

205
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,016
ELECTION.

206
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,045
ON WEDNESDAY, AFTER THE COUNT IN

207
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:04,105
MICHIGAN BEGAN TO FAVOR BIDEN,

208
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:05,279
TRUMP TWEETED OUT "WE HEREBY

209
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,096
CLAIM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN."

210
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,055
WHICH IS CLEARLY NOT HOW IT

211
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,115
WORKS.

212
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,245
CALLING DIBS ON STATES IS NOT

213
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:13,235
HOW WE ELECT PRESIDENTS.

214
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:16,196
WE USE THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE,

215
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,279
WHICH IS AT LEAST 3% LESS STUPID

216
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,055
THAN THAT.

217
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,016
THE VERY SAME DAY, THE

218
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,036
PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL LAWYER AND

219
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,216
RECENT STAR OF THE "BORAT"

220
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,005
MOVIE, RUDY GIULIANI, ARRIVED IN

221
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:27,156
PENNSYLVANIA TO TRY AND STOP

222
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,146
THEM FROM COUNTING THE VOTES

223
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,196
THAT WERE STILL REMAINING...

224
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,066
WHICH STOOD AT NEARLY A MILLION

225
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,185
THAT MORNING, MOST FROM HEAVILY

226
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:35,096
DEMOCRATIC AREAS... AND DID SO

227
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,045
WITH THIS IMPASSIONED SPEECH.

228
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:38,005
HOW MANY VOTES DO WE HAVE TO

229
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:40,135
BE AHEAD?

230
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:43,125
400,000 IS NOT ENOUGH?

231
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:45,066
WITH 80 PLUS PERCENT COUNTED?

232
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,135
I THINK THERE'S ONLY 14% OF THE

233
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,266
VOTE TO GO.

234
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,146
DO YOU THINK WE'RE STUPID?

235
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,290
YOU THINK WE'RE FOOLS?

236
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:53,266
YEAH.

237
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,226
YEAH, WE DO.

238
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,290
YEAH.

239
00:06:58,009 --> 00:06:59,135
AND, UH, ACTUALLY, THIS IS A BIT

240
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,016
AWKWARD, BECAUSE WE HAD SPACE

241
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,290
FOR A JOKE HERE, BUT THAT TOOK

242
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:01,245
NO TIME AT ALL.

243
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:02,549
INSTEAD, LET'S

244
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:03,206
LOOK AT THIS RACCOON-SHAPED

245
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,096
COOKIE JAR WITH A RACCOON IN IT.

246
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,290
DID YOU EAT ALL THE COOKIES?

247
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:06,115
I BET YOU DID.

248
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:07,255
THOSE COOKIES HAVE GONE FROM

249
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,026
BEING INSIDE ONE RACCOON TO

250
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,216
BEING INSIDE ANOTHER.

251
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,036
WHAT AN ABSOLUTE DELIGHT.

252
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,026
ANYWAY, GIULIANI'S PRESS

253
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:16,245
CONFERENCE WAS TRULY UNHINGED,

254
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,045
WITH HIM THROWING AROUND WILD

255
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:19,016
ACCUSATIONS WITH ABSOLUTELY NO

256
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,096
EVIDENCE.

257
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,400
AND PERHAPS THE BEST RESPONSE TO

258
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:22,290
IT CAME FROM JOHN FETTERMAN,

259
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,016
PENNSYLVANIA'S LIEUTENANT

260
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:29,185
TO COME IN AND STAND ON... ON

261
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:30,165
A STREET CORNER IN PHILADELPHIA

262
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:34,185
TO SAY, "WE WON PENNSYLVANIA,"

263
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:35,255
IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, LIKE, LOL.

264
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,175
I MEAN, LIKE, IT IS JUST

265
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:42,005
BIZARRE.

266
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,066
IT IS LIKE A BAD, BAD

267
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:43,226
"HOUSE OF CARDS" EPISODE.

268
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,115
YEAH, HE'S RIGHT.

269
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:45,036
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR STONE COLD

270
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,266
IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

271
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,245
BECAUSE THIS IS LIKE

272
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:48,115
"HOUSE OF CARDS" IN THAT IT'S

273
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:50,096
FULL OF POLITICAL INTRIGUE,

274
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,266
THERE'S A SEXUAL PREDATOR

275
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,055
PRETENDING TO BE PRESIDENT AT

276
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,206
THE VERY HEART OF IT, AND IT'S

277
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,255
GONE ON FOR AT LEAST FOUR

278
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,135
SEASONS TOO LONG.

279
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,206
AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, THE

280
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,185
TRUMP CAMP'S PROTESTS WERE

281
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:00,255
CONSISTENTLY INCONSISTENT IN

282
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,016
THEIR MESSAGING, PRIMARILY

283
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,065
BECAUSE, EARLY ON, IN SOME

284
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:05,255
STATES, TRUMP LOOKED LIKE HE WAS

285
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,319
AHEAD, WHILE IN OTHERS, HE

286
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:08,196
LOOKED LIKE HE WAS BEHIND, WHICH

287
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,136
MEANT THAT IN MICHIGAN, WHERE HE

288
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,026
LED EARLY ON, HIS SUPPORTERS

289
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:13,226
SHOWED UP AT A DETROIT

290
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,410
BALLOT-COUNTING SITE TO CHANT

291
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,255
STOP THE COUNT!

292
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,086
STOP THE COUNT!

293
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:26,110
STOP THE COUNT!

294
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:27,076
"STOP THE COUNT."

295
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,995
RIGHT.

296
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:28,165
BUT IN ARIZONA, WHERE TRUMP

297
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:29,086
SEEMED TO BE BEHIND, HIS

298
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,245
SUPPORTERS CHANTED THIS:

299
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:30,206
COUNT THE VOTES!

300
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,016
COUNT THE VOTES!

301
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,265
COUNT THE VOTES!

302
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,995
NOW, SETTING ASIDE THE

303
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:36,015
ABSURDITY OF TWO GROUPS ON THE

304
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,066
SAME SIDE SHOUTING COMPLETELY

305
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,096
OPPOSITE INSTRUCTIONS, IT IS

306
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,226
WORTH TAKING A MINUTE ON

307
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,235
JUST HOW WEIRD IT IS THAT ONE OF

308
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:43,076
THOSE INSTRUCTIONS IS

309
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,289
"COUNT THE VOTES."

310
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:48,176
BECAUSE THEY WERE.

311
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,206
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE

312
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,086
BALLOT COUNTERS WERE DOING.

313
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,186
IT'D BE LIKE A DAD CHANTING AT

314
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,245
HIS TEENAGE SON'S BEDROOM DOOR,

315
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:54,015
"BEAT THAT MEAT!

316
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,125
BEAT THAT MEAT!"

317
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:56,245
HE IS!

318
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,115
HE'S DOING IT!

319
00:08:58,139 --> 00:08:59,995
YOU REALLY DON'T NEED TO CHEER

320
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:00,066
HIM ON.

321
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:00,245
IN FACT, ALL YOU'RE DOING IS

322
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:01,206
MAKING IT WAY HARDER FOR HIM TO

323
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,216
FINISH.

324
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,066
AND UNFORTUNATELY, THE

325
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,176
INFORMATION VACUUM THAT FORMED

326
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,196
IN THOSE THREE DAYS PROVIDED

327
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,380
AMPLE SPACE FOR TRUMP AND HIS

328
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,176
SUPPORTERS TO JUST THROW

329
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,255
COMPLETE BULLSHIT AROUND.

330
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:14,166
AT ONE POINT, TRUMP'S TWITTER

331
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,430
TIMELINE LOOKED LIKE THIS, WITH

332
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,196
A WHOLE RUN OF TWEETS FLAGGED AS

333
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,226
"DISPUTED OR MISLEADING."

334
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,056
MEANWHILE, GIULIANI WAS TWEETING

335
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,115
OUT THIS ARTICLE AND IMPLYING

336
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:24,135
21,000 DEAD PEOPLE HAD VOTED IN

337
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,196
PENNSYLVANIA... WHICH THEY

338
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,086
HADN'T.

339
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,166
ALSO RUMORS WERE FLYING AROUND

340
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,216
THAT TRUMP BALLOTS WERE BEING

341
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,105
DISQUALIFIED IN ARIZONA BECAUSE

342
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:35,076
SHARPIES HAD BEEN USED TO FILL

343
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,056
THEM OUT, WHICH WAS FALSE.

344
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,056
AND ERIC TRUMP TWEETED OUT A

345
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,235
FAKE VIDEO OF BALLOTS IN

346
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:41,025
VIRGINIA BEACH BEING BURNED...

347
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:42,015
A VIDEO THAT THE CITY ITSELF HAD

348
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,086
DEBUNKED A DAY BEFORE HE TWEETED

349
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,105
IT.

350
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:46,115
AND THAT IS REALLY A SHAME,

351
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:47,235
BECAUSE NORMALLY THE TRUMP SONS

352
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:48,206
ARE SO GOOD AT GETTING TO THE

353
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,145
TRUTH... YOU KNOW, LIKE WHEN

354
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:52,056
THEY SOLVED THE MYSTERY OF

355
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,216
"CAN A BEARD ACTUALLY MAKE

356
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,235
SOMEONE LOOK MORE LIKE A CHILD?"

357
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:56,995
THE ANSWER TURNED OUT TO BE A

358
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:58,125
RESOUNDING YES.

359
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:02,076
GOOD WORK, GUMSHOES.

360
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,145
BUT CONSPIRACY THEORIZING RAN SO

361
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:05,265
RAMPANT THIS WEEK THAT, DURING A

362
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:07,125
PRESS BRIEFING FROM A NEVADA

363
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,995
VOTING REGISTRAR, THIS HAPPENED:

364
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:10,035
THE BIDEN CRIME FAMILY IS

365
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:11,125
STEALING THE ELECTION!

366
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:12,255
THE MEDIA IS COVERING IT UP!

367
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,076
THE BIDEN CRIME FAMILY IS

368
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,125
STEALING THIS ELECTION!

369
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,046
THE MEDIA IS COVERING IT UP!

370
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,155
THE BIDEN CRIME FAMILY IS

371
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:19,196
STEALING THIS ELECTION!

372
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,255
THE MEDIA IS COVERING IT UP!

373
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,025
WE WANT OUR FREEDOM FOR THE

374
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:23,015
WORLD!

375
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,265
GIVE US OUR FREEDOM, JOE BIDEN!

376
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:25,186
JOE BIDEN IS COVERING UP THIS

377
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,176
ELECTION!

378
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:33,025
HE'S STEALING IT!

379
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:34,226
WHERE WERE WE?

380
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,206
WHAT WAS THE LAST QUESTION?

381
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,265
OKAY, THERE IS SO MUCH

382
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:39,245
TO DEAL WITH THERE.

383
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:41,076
THERE'S THE ARCTIC COOL

384
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,245
DISPLAYED BY THAT REGISTRAR

385
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:42,125
WHILE HE WAS BEING INTERRUPTED

386
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:44,005
BY A WALKING INTERNET COMMENT.

387
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:45,066
THEN THERE WAS THAT MAN'S SHIRT,

388
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,995
FEATURING WHAT I ASSUME WERE HIS

389
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:48,025
THREE FAVORITE THINGS.

390
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:48,235
WHICH I'M LEGITIMATELY JEALOUS

391
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:49,186
OF, BECAUSE NOW I WANT A TANK

392
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,046
TOP WITH MY THREE FAVORITE

393
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,056
THINGS ON IT... SPECIFICALLY,

394
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,235
OVERSIGHT, FOIA REQUESTS, AND

395
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:58,245
HAMSTERS IN SPEEDOS.

396
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:00,206
NOW THAT IS A SHIRT.

397
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,206
BUT I THINK MY FAVORITE THING IS

398
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,025
JUST HOW PAINFULLY CLEAR IT IS

399
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:06,166
THAT THAT GUY WAS EXPECTING TO

400
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,046
GET DRAGGED AWAY AND WAS THEN

401
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:07,235
COMPLETELY STUCK WHEN IT DIDN'T

402
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:08,279
HAPPEN.

403
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,289
"THE BIDEN CRIME FAMILY IS

404
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:14,046
STEALING OUR FREEDOM!

405
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,145
THE BIDEN CRIME FAMILY IS...

406
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:15,255
REALLY?

407
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,176
GUYS?

408
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,025
NOTHING?

409
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:17,245
NO ONE'S GONNA ESCORT ME OUTTA

410
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:18,155
HERE?

411
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:19,166
'CAUSE HONESTLY, I WAS REALLY

412
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,056
COUNTING ON SOMEONE TOSSING ME

413
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,226
IN A CAR AND TAKING ME AWAY.

414
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,226
I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A RIDE

415
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,245
HOME OTHERWISE.

416
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:25,186
ALL RIGHT, I GUESS I'LL WALK.

417
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,265
HAVE A GOOD DAY, EVERYONE.

418
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:28,166
PIZZAGATE WAS A 9/11 OR

419
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,265
WHATEVER."

420
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:36,105
AND IN THE MIDST OF ALL OF THIS,

421
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,145
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WAS LOUDLY

422
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:38,135
ANNOUNCING THAT IT WAS FILING

423
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,015
MULTIPLE LAWSUITS IN MULTIPLE

424
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:39,995
STATES, TRYING TO CAST A CLOUD

425
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:43,235
OVER THE WHOLE PROCESS.

426
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:44,135
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW JUST

427
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,319
HOW RIDICULOUS THOSE LAWSUITS

428
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,105
WERE AND STILL ARE.

429
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:47,245
ONE CASE IN GEORGIA CENTERED ON

430
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:48,115
A POLL WATCHER WHO "LEFT THE

431
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:49,025
ROOM" AND THOUGHT THAT A STACK

432
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:50,056
OF 53 BALLOTS THAT MAY OR MAY

433
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,096
NOT HAVE ARRIVED LATE MIGHT OR

434
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,166
MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN COUNTED

435
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,155
WHILE THEY WERE AWAY.

436
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:57,005
ALTHOUGH THE POLL WATCHER

437
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:58,135
COULDN'T SAY FOR SURE BECAUSE,

438
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,186
AGAIN, HE HAD LEFT THE ROOM.

439
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,005
THAT PARTICULAR CASE WAS

440
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:02,105
DISMISSED BY A JUDGE BECAUSE,

441
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:04,066
AND I QUOTE, "THE COURT FINDS

442
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,206
THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE."

443
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,226
MEANWHILE, IN MICHIGAN,

444
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,066
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN REQUESTED

445
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,186
THAT ABSENTEE BALLOTS STOP

446
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,995
BEING COUNTED AFTER... AND THIS

447
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:12,186
IS KEY... THE COUNTING HAD

448
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,196
ESSENTIALLY BEEN FINISHED IN THE

449
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,015
STATE.

450
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,206
THAT SUIT RELIED ON ONE

451
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,186
POLL WATCHER HAVING HEARD A

452
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,056
RUMOR FROM SOMEONE ELSE THAT

453
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,035
SOME LATE BALLOTS WERE BEING

454
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:22,025
COUNTED.

455
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:24,155
AND WHEN THE JUDGE POINTED OUT

456
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:25,115
THAT THAT WAS TOTAL HEARSAY, THE

457
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:27,176
TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S LAWYER TRIED TO

458
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,066
WRIGGLE OUT OF IT BEFORE BEING

459
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,245
SLAPPED DOWN HARD.

460
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:34,035
THIS IS A FIRST-HAND, FACTUAL

461
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:37,066
STATEMENT MADE BY MISS CONERAN,

462
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,995
AND SHE HAS MADE THAT STATEMENT

463
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:41,245
BASED ON HER OWN FIRST-HAND

464
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:42,216
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AND KNOWLEDGE,

465
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,186
WHICH...

466
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,196
"I HEARD SOMEBODY ELSE SAY

467
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,155
SOMETHING."

468
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:46,155
TELL ME WHY THAT'S NOT HEARSAY?

469
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:47,076
COME ON NOW.

470
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,035
YEAH.

471
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,206
"COME ON NOW."

472
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,125
AND, LOOK, I'M NO LEGAL EXPERT,

473
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:55,005
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S NOT A

474
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:56,076
GREAT SIGN FOR YOUR CASE WHEN A

475
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,135
JUDGE GIVES YOU THE JUDICIAL

476
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,135
EQUIVALENT OF "FUCK OUTTA HERE."

477
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,145
NOW, ONE BIG TRUMP COMPLAINT

478
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:00,226
THAT HE'S MAKING A LOT RIGHT

479
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,245
NOW, SO YOU'LL PROBABLY BE

480
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:04,076
HEARING IT FOR THE REST OF YOUR

481
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,289
LIFE, IS THAT THE ELECTION IS

482
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:06,056
ILLEGITIMATE BECAUSE REPUBLICAN

483
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,255
POLL WATCHERS WEREN'T GIVEN

484
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,995
ACCESS TO THE BALLOT-COUNTING IN

485
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:11,066
PENNSYLVANIA.

486
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,105
HE ACTUALLY TWEETED ON SATURDAY,

487
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:13,216
"BAD THINGS HAPPENED WHICH OUR

488
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,155
OBSERVERS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO

489
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:15,289
SEE."

490
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:17,066
WHICH IS A TOUGH CHARGE TO MAKE

491
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,056
STICK, BECAUSE... BY THE NATURE

492
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,245
OF THE ACCUSATION... YOU DIDN'T

493
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:23,056
SEE THEM.

494
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,166
BUT THE CLAIM WAS ACTUALLY EVEN

495
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,196
MORE MERITLESS THAN IT APPEARS,

496
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,096
WHICH, OF ALL NETWORKS, FOX NEWS

497
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,265
POINTED OUT.

498
00:13:28,289 --> 00:13:30,279
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS SAID

499
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,226
THAT THEY WANTED TO HAVE THEIR

500
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,096
POLL WATCHERS THERE, AND I GUESS

501
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,196
THEY WERE SAYING THEY WERE ASKED

502
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,289
TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR

503
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:40,046
SOMETHING THAT THEY SAY THEY

504
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,015
WEREN'T EVEN ABLE TO PARTICIPATE

505
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,025
IN OR TO BE ABLE TO SEE, AND SO

506
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:45,216
THAT'S, I THINK, WHERE THEY

507
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,025
WOULD SAY THAT NEEDS TO BE

508
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:49,176
RECTIFIED, IF IT COULD BE.

509
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,235
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

510
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:52,135
IT'S NOT TRUE.

511
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:54,995
IT'S JUST NOT TRUE.

512
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:55,226
THE CLAIM FROM THE TRUMP

513
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,206
CAMPAIGN AND THE PRESIDENT ABOUT

514
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,235
THAT IS NOT TRUE, IT IS FALSE.

515
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:00,265
IN FACT, THE LAWYERS FOR THE

516
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:02,289
TRUMP CAMPAIGN LAST NIGHT IN

517
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:08,005
FEDERAL COURT ADMITTED THAT.

518
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:08,176
HE'S RIGHT.

519
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,086
THEY ADMITTED IT.

520
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,995
SPECIFICALLY, THE JUDGE ASKED,

521
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:15,216
"ARE PEOPLE REPRESENTING

522
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,096
DONALD J. TRUMP IN THAT ROOM?"

523
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,035
TO WHICH THE CAMPAIGN LAWYER

524
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:17,196
SAID "YES," AND THE JUDGE

525
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,086
REPLIED, "I'M SORRY, THEN WHAT'S

526
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,235
YOUR PROBLEM?"

527
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:19,245
MAKING THIS OFFICIALLY THE

528
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:21,166
SINGLE SASSIEST WEEK IN THE

529
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,066
HISTORY OF THE JUDICIARY.

530
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,155
THEY MUST HAVE TRADED IN THEIR

531
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:25,105
GAVELS FOR UMBRELLAS, BECAUSE

532
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:26,096
THESE JURISTS ARE THROWING SOME

533
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,035
SHADE.

534
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:31,015
AND THE EMBARRASSING FLIMSINESS

535
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,176
OF THESE FRAUD CLAIMS STARTS TO

536
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,115
MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU SEE JUST HOW

537
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,056
DESPERATELY THE TRUMP CAMP WAS

538
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,115
TRYING TO DRUM THEM UP.

539
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:37,226
TAKE ARIZONA.

540
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,056
THEY ANNOUNCED AT A PRESS

541
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,235
CONFERENCE ON THURSDAY THAT THEY

542
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:41,145
HAD GATHERED "CONCERNS BY

543
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:42,206
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE" ABOUT

544
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,025
VOTING IRREGULARITIES.

545
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,155
WHICH ON ITS FACE SOUNDS

546
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:48,046
DRAMATIC.

547
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,245
BUT IT'S ALSO A LITTLE AT ODDS

548
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:50,995
WITH THIS MOMENT, CAPTURED JUST

549
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,176
HI, EVERYONE.

550
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,015
IF ANYONE HAS ANY PERSONAL

551
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,206
EXAMPLE WHERE THEY'VE WITNESSED

552
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,035
ELECTION FRAUD HERE IN ARIZONA,

553
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:02,046
PLEASE COME SEE ME.

554
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,096
I NEED A CONCRETE EXAMPLE, I

555
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,196
NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO.

556
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,015
RIGHT OVER THERE IN THE CORNER,

557
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:11,066
THANK YOU

558
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:11,235
OKAY, THAT IS JUST

559
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:12,145
PATHETIC.

560
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:13,096
ALTHOUGH I DO LIKE THE IDEA THAT

561
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,995
SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY WITNESSED

562
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:16,135
ELECTION FRAUD AND HAD PROOF

563
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,096
WAITING UNTIL THAT GLORIFIED

564
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,005
BLOCK PARTY TO TELL ANYONE ABOUT

565
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:26,029
IT.

566
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:29,125
"YEAH, I SAW A GUY IN A SKI MASK

567
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:30,216
PULLING FAKE BALLOTS OUT OF HIS

568
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,105
KIA FESTIVA, BUT IT DIDN'T OCCUR

569
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:31,289
TO ME TO TELL ANYONE ABOUT IT

570
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:32,216
UNTIL A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE

571
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,255
LAW FIRM HANGOVER, HANGOVER,

572
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,155
DIVORCE & MEAT SWEATS TOLD ME TO

573
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:36,066
MEET HIM OVER THERE IN THE

574
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:39,096
CORNER.

575
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,035
I'M SO GLAD I WAS WONDERING BY."

576
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:43,125
BUT WAIT, THAT'S NOT ALL...

577
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:44,166
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ALSO SET UP

578
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,046
THIS WEBSITE AND PHONE NUMBER

579
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:45,216
WHERE THEY INVITED PEOPLE TO

580
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,115
SUBMIT EVIDENCE OF VOTER FRAUD,

581
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:47,166
MEANING IF YOU, SAY, WANTED TO

582
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,115
SUPPLY THEM WITH AN INCIDENT YOU

583
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:49,035
FOUND SUSPICIOUS, YOU COULD DO

584
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:50,015
THAT.

585
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,186
YOU STILL CAN.

586
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,265
YOU CAN SIMPLY GO TO THIS

587
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:57,115
ADDRESS AND SEND THEM WHATEVER

588
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:00,226
EVIDENCE YOU WANT.

589
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,410
THERE'S EVEN AN OPTION TO ADD

590
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:03,005
PHOTOGRAPHIC PROOF.

591
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:03,265
QUICK FUN FACT, I DON'T KNOW WHY

592
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:04,135
A

593
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:04,995
POLITICAL TERM OF ART FOR

594
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:05,145
ELECTION SHENANIGANS IS

595
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:06,155
RATFUCKING.

596
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:09,226
SO IF YOU, SAY, HAPPEN TO HAVE

597
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,995
ANY ACCESS TO IMAGES OF

598
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:15,096
PENNSYLVANIA-BASED RATFUCKING,

599
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,206
IT'S FRANKLY YOUR PATRIOTIC DUTY

600
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,025
TO SEND THEM TO THE

601
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:19,245
TRUMP CAMPAIGN STRAIGHT AWAY.

602
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,155
AND ALL THESE POINTLESS LAWSUITS

603
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:22,995
ARE CLEARLY GOING TO COST A LOT

604
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:24,196
OF MONEY, WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY

605
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,196
THE CAMPAIGN HAS SPENT THE LAST

606
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,145
FEW DAYS FRANTICALLY TRYING TO

607
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:28,035
FUNDRAISE FOR THEM, EMAILING

608
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:29,255
SUPPORTERS IN AN INCREASINGLY

609
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,226
AGGRESSIVE MANNER, WITH ONE

610
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,155
MESSAGE READING, "THIS IS YOUR

611
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:34,005
FINAL NOTICE.

612
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:35,186
SO FAR, YOU'VE IGNORED ALL OUR

613
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,046
EMAILS ASKING YOU TO JOIN US IN

614
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,025
DEFENDING THE ELECTION.

615
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:41,096
YOU'VE IGNORED TEAM TRUMP, ERIC,

616
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,226
LARA, DON, THE VICE PRESIDENT,

617
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,056
AND YOU'VE EVEN IGNORED THE

618
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,176
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES."

619
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,255
AND FINAL NOTICE FOR WHAT?

620
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,025
TO NOT GIVE THEM MONEY?

621
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:54,206
MAYBE IT'S THE LAST CHANCE

622
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,289
TO GO TO THE OFFICIAL

623
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:57,206
DONALD J. TRUMP SITE AND BUY

624
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,086
THIS DOG LEASH FEATURING A DOG

625
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,995
WHO I CAN ONLY ASSUME WAS

626
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:06,226
LOBOTOMIZED AND GIVEN RABIES

627
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,106
IMMEDIATELY BEFORE HAVING THIS

628
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:07,216
PICTURE TAKEN.

629
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,320
ALSO, QUICK SIDE NOTE ABOUT

630
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,025
IN THE FINE PRINT, IT MENTIONS

631
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:11,136
THAT, RATHER THAN FUNDING

632
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,176
LAWSUITS, HALF OF ANY

633
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,065
CONTRIBUTION WILL BE USED TO

634
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:16,279
RETIRE DEBT FROM TRUMP'S

635
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,176
RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN, WHICH IS

636
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,255
COMPLETELY UNSURPRISING, AND NOT

637
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,479
EVEN THE WORST THING HE'S EVER

638
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:23,186
ASKED HIS SUPPORTERS TO DO,

639
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,226
BECAUSE THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE

640
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,196
WHEN HE MADE THEM WATCH HIM DO

641
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,055
THIS DANCE, WHICH LOOKS LIKE

642
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,015
HE'S MILKING TWO COWS AT ONCE

643
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:36,289
AND ENJOYING IT SEXUALLY

644
00:17:37,009 --> 00:17:38,005
VERY MUCH INDEED.

645
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:39,075
BUT PERHAPS THE SINGLE MOST

646
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,116
PATHETIC PART OF THIS ENTIRE

647
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,289
WEEK WAS THAT IN THE MOMENTS

648
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:42,005
BEFORE THIS RACE WAS CALLED ON

649
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:42,196
SATURDAY MORNING, TRUMP TWEETED

650
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,055
OUT "I WON THIS ELECTION,

651
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:43,245
BY A LOT!"... ALL CAPS,

652
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:46,015
EXCLAMATION MARK.

653
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,095
AND IF THAT WASN'T A BAD ENOUGH

654
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:49,095
CASE OF DENIAL, THIS IS HOW SOME

655
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:51,226
OF HIS SUPPORTERS RESPONDED TO

656
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:55,075
NEWS OF HIS DEFEAT.

657
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,045
LOOK, I WOULD LOVE TO

658
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:17,206
MAKE FUN OF THAT, BUT

659
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,176
UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE

660
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,075
NO TIME FOR LOSERS.

661
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,216
BUT HERE'S THE REALLY IMPORTANT

662
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,480
AFTER THIS ABSOLUTE YEAR

663
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:24,186
OF A WEEK... THE DAYS OF

664
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,106
COUNTING, THE MISINFORMATION,

665
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,289
THE DESPERATE, PATHETIC ATTEMPTS

666
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:30,075
TO PAINT THIS PROCESS AS

667
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:31,146
FRAUDULENT... THE FACT IS, TRUMP

668
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,015
LOST THIS ELECTION.

669
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,226
HE LOST.

670
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,166
ALL THAT BULLSHIT WHICH WE'VE

671
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,136
GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO SEEING WORK

672
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,035
DID NOT WORK THIS TIME.

673
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:41,126
AND IT'S NOT LIKE TRUMP AND HIS

674
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:41,995
FAMILY ARE GOING TO STOP...

675
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:42,235
THEY'RE GOING TO CARRY ON

676
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:43,235
GRIFTING AND LYING LIKE THEY'VE

677
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:46,995
ALWAYS DONE, BUT ONCE HE'S OUT

678
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:48,085
OF THE WHITE HOUSE, IT'S JUST

679
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:49,156
NOT GOING TO HAVE THE SAME

680
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,015
EFFECT ANYMORE.

681
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,025
IT'S NOT GOING TO DIRECTLY

682
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:54,206
IMPACT EVERY AMERICAN'S LIFE.

683
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,279
AND THAT ALONE IS FUCKING

684
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,055
FANTASTIC.

685
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:56,235
AND LOOK, BY TEMPERAMENT, I'M

686
00:18:56,259 --> 00:18:58,005
INCLINED TO OVER-ANALYZE

687
00:18:58,029 --> 00:18:59,075
EVERYTHING.

688
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:02,196
AND I CAN ALREADY FEEL MYSELF

689
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,025
STARTING TO DO IT, FOCUS ON THE

690
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:04,206
NEGATIVES HERE AND BE CYNICAL

691
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,186
ABOUT WHAT A BIDEN PRESIDENCY

692
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,055
COULD... OR IS EVEN GOING TO

693
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:08,005
TRY... TO ACHIEVE.

694
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:10,136
BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO ANYTHING

695
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,196
NEGATIVE AT ALL, LET ME JUST

696
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,500
GIVE US ALL A QUICK MOMENT, WITH

697
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,005
NO CAVEATS, OF CELEBRATION.

698
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:16,255
IN FACT, LET'S PUT 30 SECONDS ON

699
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:18,126
THE CLOCK RIGHT NOW, DURING

700
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,196
WHICH TIME EVERYONE CAN JUST

701
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,085
EXPERIENCE JOY IN WHATEVER FORM

702
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:24,136
YOU WANT... DANCING, SCREAMING,

703
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,116
BANGING A FRYING PAN... IT'S UP

704
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,265
TO YOU.

705
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:29,005
PERSONALLY, I'M GOING TO DO ONE

706
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:30,055
OF MY FAVORITE ACTIVITIES, WHICH

707
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,126
IS DISPENSING EXCELLENT FACTS

708
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,075
ABOUT OCTOPUSES OVER FOOTAGE OF

709
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:32,265
PEOPLE CELEBRATING THIS

710
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:33,289
ELECTION.

711
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,095
GO.

712
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:38,085
OCTOPUSES ARE GREAT.

713
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:39,279
THEY HAVE THREE HEARTS, BLUE

714
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,995
BLOOD, THEY CAN TASTE WITH THEIR

715
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:42,106
ARMS, THEIR BRAINS ARE SPREAD

716
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,255
THROUGHOUT THEIR BODY, THEY CAN

717
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:44,995
CHANGE SHAPE AND COLOR, THEY

718
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:46,085
HAVE BEAKS, THEY CAN OPEN

719
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:47,196
BOTTLES, THEY REMEMBER FACES,

720
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,045
AND THEY HOLD GRUDGES.

721
00:19:49,069 --> 00:19:50,065
ONE TIME AN OCTOPUS ESCAPED A

722
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,156
NEW ZEALAND AQUARIUM BY CRAWLING

723
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,255
DOWN A DRAIN PIPE INTO THE

724
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:54,055
OCEAN.

725
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,095
ALSO THERE WAS AN EXPERIMENT A

726
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:57,085
FEW YEARS BACK WHERE SCIENTISTS

727
00:19:57,109 --> 00:19:58,196
GAVE OCTOPUSES ECSTASY, AND THEY

728
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,025
LEARNED THAT IF OCTOPUSES TAKE

729
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:00,995
ECSTASY, THEY'LL HANG OUT AND

730
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:06,045
PARTY WITH OTHER OCTOPUSES, BUT

731
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:07,206
IF YOU DON'T DO THAT, THEY

732
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,085
PREFER TO KEEP TO THEMSELVES.

733
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:08,245
THAT'S FROM A REAL STUDY.

734
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:09,196
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

735
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,085
I'M NOT SAYING I WANT TO FUCK AN

736
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:13,015
OCTOPUS, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

737
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,186
I KIND OF...

738
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,216
OH, THAT'S IT.

739
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,035
THAT'S TIME.

740
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,085
THAT WAS UNCOMPLICATED FUN.

741
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:23,045
SO NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND, I AM

742
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:23,255
GOING TO OVER-ANALYZE THIS

743
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:26,156
ELECTION JUST A LITTLE BIT.

744
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,065
NOT MUCH THOUGH, MAINLY BECAUSE

745
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:27,255
IT'S STILL TOO EARLY TO DRAW ANY

746
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:28,176
BIG CONCLUSIONS.

747
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,480
THERE ARE TWO KEY THINGS WE KNOW

748
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,176
THOUGH.

749
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,025
THE GREAT NEWS IS THAT THIS

750
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:34,176
ELECTION HAD RECORD-BREAKING

751
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,065
TURNOUT, AND OVER 74 MILLION

752
00:20:35,089 --> 00:20:36,085
PEOPLE CHOSE TO KICK

753
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,025
DONALD TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE.

754
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:40,226
THE LESS GOOD NEWS IS THAT MORE

755
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,015
THAN 70 MILLION PEOPLE VOTED FOR

756
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,075
HIM AND EVERYTHING HE'S SAID AND

757
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:46,265
STANDS FOR, AND THAT'S SOMETHING

758
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:48,126
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RECKON

759
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,065
WITH FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

760
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:54,005
AND I KNOW THAT BIDEN HAS

761
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:54,196
REPEATEDLY SAID ON THE CAMPAIGN

762
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,166
TRAIL THAT THE UGLINESS TRUMP

763
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,035
REPRESENTS IS SIMPLY "NOT WHO WE

764
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,206
ARE"... HE DID IT CONSTANTLY IN

765
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,136
MOMENTS LIKE THIS:

766
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,176
THE ONLY THING THAT COULD

767
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,360
TEAR AMERICA APART IS AMERICA

768
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,025
ITSELF.

769
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:06,235
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT TRUMP'S

770
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:10,216
BEEN TRYING TO DO FROM THE VERY

771
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,085
BEGINNING, DIVIDING AMERICA

772
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:13,075
BASED ON RACE, RELIGION, GENDER,

773
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:14,995
NATIONAL ORIGIN.

774
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:16,136
IT'S WRONG.

775
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,146
IT'S NOT WHO WE ARE.

776
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,186
THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE.

777
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,106
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP

778
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,146
IS.

779
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,235
LET'S KEEP SHOWING THEM WHO WE

780
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:30,136
ARE.

781
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,106
LOOK, THAT IS A

782
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,065
REALLY NICE SENTIMENT, BUT

783
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:38,116
DIVIDING AMERICA BASED ON RACE,

784
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,206
RELIGION, GENDER, AND

785
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,035
NATIONAL ORIGIN HAS

786
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:40,226
FREQUENTLY BEEN VERY MUCH WHO WE

787
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,156
ARE.

788
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,055
IN FACT, YOU COULD ARGUE THAT,

789
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:43,075
IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICA, THE

790
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:43,265
ONE-SENTENCE VERSION OF TRUMP'S

791
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:44,206
PRESIDENCY IS "HE KEPT SHOWING

792
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:49,055
THEM WHO WE ARE."

793
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,216
SO WE CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT

794
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,206
IGNORE THAT MILLIONS VOTED FOR

795
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,995
TRUMP, MEANING THEY EITHER

796
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:54,095
ACTIVELY SUPPORTED HIS BIGOTRY,

797
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,226
OR AT THE VERY LEAST, WERE

798
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,216
COMFORTABLE ENOUGH WITH IT TO

799
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,116
VOTE FOR HIM ANYWAY.

800
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,156
WHICH ISN'T GREAT.

801
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,025
IT'S LIKE IF YOUR GRANDMA WAS

802
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:01,116
DATING TWO OLD GUYS, BOTH OF

803
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,106
WHOM HAD FOUGHT IN WORLD WAR II,

804
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,035
AND IN THE END, SHE PICKS PETE,

805
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:04,235
WHO SEEMS DECENT AND WORKS AT

806
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:05,255
THE LIBRARY AND YOU'RE HAPPY FOR

807
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:07,156
HER.

808
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,136
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU ARE

809
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,126
WONDERING HOW THE FUCK SHE GOT

810
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,075
SO FAR WITH KLAUS.

811
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:13,106
BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T REALLY

812
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,255
REFLECT THAT WELL ON HER.

813
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:20,035
AND EVEN IN THE JOY AND RELIEF

814
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:21,126
AT THE END OF THIS WEEK, IT DOES

815
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,146
FEEL WORTH REMEMBERING HOW SCARY

816
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,085
IT FELT AS IT HAPPENED, WITH

817
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,126
TRUMP SUPPORTERS SWARMING AND

818
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,075
FOLLOWING A BIDEN-HARRIS BUS IN

819
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:30,216
TEXAS, AND THAT MOMENT IN

820
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,045
DETROIT THAT WE SAW EARLIER,

821
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:34,126
WHERE A LARGELY WHITE CROWD

822
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,065
SHOWED UP IN A CITY THAT'S

823
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:35,196
80% BLACK TO SHOUT

824
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,095
THAT THEY SHOULD STOP COUNTING

825
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,065
THEIR VOTES.

826
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,206
AND IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW

827
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,186
THOSE IMAGES RHYME WITH HISTORY,

828
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,156
IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST

829
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,126
NOT BE USED TO SEEING THEM IN

830
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,176
COLOR.

831
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,055
BECAUSE THE LAST FOUR YEARS

832
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:47,075
WEREN'T ABOUT JUST ONE MAN...

833
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,015
AND THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE

834
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:49,075
LAST FOUR YEARS.

835
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:50,226
AND EVEN THAT ONE MAN IS BY NO

836
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,126
MEANS GOING AWAY.

837
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,176
WHATEVER HAPPENS,

838
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,085
DONALD TRUMP IS THE CURRENT AND

839
00:22:58,109 --> 00:23:00,116
FUTURE LEADER OF THE REPUBLICAN

840
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,106
PARTY.

841
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,156
CERTAINLY AT LEAST UNTIL SOMEONE

842
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,279
ELSE COMES ALONG WITH HIS

843
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,235
STAMINA, CHARISMA, AND DRIVE.

844
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,235
PUTTING ASIDE THE

845
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,035
WILDLY DIVERGENT DEFINITIONS WE

846
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:09,156
HAVE OF "STAMINA, CHARISMA,

847
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,065
AND DRIVE," THAT "GET OUT"

848
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,265
GARDEN PARTY GUEST IS RIGHT WHEN

849
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:14,186
SHE SAYS DONALD TRUMP IS HERE TO

850
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:17,015
STAY... ALTHOUGH NOT IN OFFICE,

851
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,235
HOWEVER HARD HE RESISTS GOING.

852
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:19,539
AS A BIDEN CAMPAIGN SPOKESPERSON

853
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,186
TOLD THE PRESS THIS WEEK,

854
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,025
"THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

855
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:24,245
IS PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF

856
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,265
ESCORTING TRESPASSERS OUT OF THE

857
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:28,095
WHITE HOUSE."

858
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,075
WHICH IS JUST A NICE SENTENCE TO

859
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:33,196
HEAR.

860
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,196
AND THERE IS GOING TO BE TIME TO

861
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,085
TALK ABOUT WHAT TRUMPISM IS

862
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:35,289
GOING TO MEAN GOING FORWARD,

863
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:36,265
JUST AS THERE'S GOING TO BE TIME

864
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,995
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS WEEK

865
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:40,206
MEANS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY,

866
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,206
WHICH DIDN'T GET EVERYTHING THEY

867
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,289
HOPED FOR.

868
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:43,255
THEY LOST SEATS IN THE HOUSE,

869
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,045
AND THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR

870
00:23:45,069 --> 00:23:46,186
NOT THEY'LL HAVE A SENATE

871
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,410
MAJORITY IS DOWN TO TWO RUNOFF

872
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,095
ELECTIONS IN GEORGIA IN JANUARY.

873
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,176
BUT THE REAL TAKEAWAY OF THIS

874
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,245
ELECTION IS THAT THERE'S NO EASY

875
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:55,085
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF WHO WE

876
00:23:55,109 --> 00:24:01,146
ARE.

877
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,045
A PERFECT EXAMPLE IS THIS:

878
00:24:03,069 --> 00:24:03,289
KAMALA HARRIS IS NOW GOING TO BE

879
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:04,216
VICE PRESIDENT.

880
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,005
THE FIRST WOMAN VICE PRESIDENT,

881
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:06,196
THE FIRST SOUTH ASIAN AMERICAN

882
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,245
VICE PRESIDENT, THE FIRST BLACK

883
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:08,136
VICE PRESIDENT, AND THE SECOND

884
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,360
BLACK PERSON WE'VE SENT TO THE

885
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:12,186
WHITE HOUSE IN THE LAST 12

886
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,216
YEARS.

887
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,196
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

888
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,116
UNFORTUNATELY, WE DID ELECT A

889
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,045
WHITE SUPREMACIST IN BETWEEN

890
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:18,206
THEM.

891
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,245
AND THE FACT IS THAT ALL OF THAT

892
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:22,279
TOGETHER IS KIND OF WHO WE ARE.

893
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,186
WE'RE THE COUNTRY THAT DID ALL

894
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,186
THOSE THINGS.

895
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:30,095
AND IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO DENY

896
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:30,289
THAT REALITY.

897
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:32,106
AND JUST A FINAL QUICK POINT

898
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,136
DEFEATING TRUMP TOOK A LOT

899
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,995
OF WORK, MUCH OF IT BY ACTIVIST

900
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:36,289
GROUPS LED BY THOSE WITH THE

901
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:38,005
MOST TO LOSE FROM A SECOND TRUMP

902
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:39,216
TERM.

903
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,196
A BIG FACTOR IN THE VOTE IN

904
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,995
ARIZONA WAS INDIGENOUS AND

905
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:42,235
LATINO PEOPLE COMING OUT FOR

906
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:44,279
BIDEN.

907
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,226
AND IN PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN,

908
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,015
AND GEORGIA, BLACK VOTERS WERE

909
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:49,245
ABSOLUTELY KEY, WITH THE GROUPS

910
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:51,055
ORGANIZING THAT VOTE,

911
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:52,235
PARTICULARLY BLACK WOMEN,

912
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:54,216
WORKING RELENTLESSLY FOR YEARS.

913
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,196
AND IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AHEAD,

914
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,116
THERE'S LIKELY TO BE A LOT OF

915
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,235
TALK FROM WHITE PEOPLE ABOUT HOW

916
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:01,206
BLACK AND BROWN VOTERS "SAVED

917
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,289
US," WHICH KIND OF MISSES THE

918
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:05,085
POINT A LITTLE BIT, BECAUSE THEY

919
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:07,176
WEREN'T SO MUCH VOTING AS A

920
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,126
FAVOR FOR WHITE PEOPLE SO MUCH

921
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,126
AS VOTING TO PROTECT THEMSELVES

922
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,106
AND THEIR COMMUNITIES FROM

923
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,126
SOMEONE TRYING TO DO THEM ACTIVE

924
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,176
HARM.

925
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,166
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME LESSONS

926
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,166
IN SOME OF THAT ORGANIZING.

927
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,235
IN GEORGIA, STACEY ABRAMS, ALONG

928
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:21,186
WITH MANY OTHERS, HELPED TO

929
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:23,126
REGISTER HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

930
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,156
OF NEW VOTERS OVER THE PAST TWO

931
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,255
YEARS... HALF OF THEM PEOPLE OF

932
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,156
COLOR... AND TURN THEM OUT TO

933
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,126
THE POLLS.

934
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,226
IN FACT, JUST BEFORE THE

935
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,126
PRESIDENTIAL RACE WAS CALLED,

936
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,216
SHE WAS ALREADY TWEETING OUT

937
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,245
DETAILS ABOUT THE JANUARY 5

938
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:37,146
RUNOFF FOR SENATE AND MAKING

939
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,245
SURE PEOPLE REQUEST THEIR

940
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:39,035
BALLOTS.

941
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:40,196
WHY?

942
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,025
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S

943
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:44,075
FUCKING DOING.

944
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:45,279
AND IF THE DEMOCRATS

945
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,136
ARE SMART... WHICH THEY AREN'T

946
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,126
ALWAYS... THEY SHOULD LISTEN TO

947
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,265
HER AND ACTIVISTS LIKE HER GOING

948
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:52,085
FORWARD.

949
00:25:52,109 --> 00:25:53,255
LOOK, IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG

950
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,995
ROAD TO DIG US OUT OF THE PLACE

951
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:56,025
THAT THE LAST FOUR YEARS HAVE

952
00:25:56,049 --> 00:25:57,126
PUT US IN, BUT THAT'S WHY IT'S

953
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,265
SO IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THE

954
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:00,216
