1
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,920
Hi there, welcome to the show!

2
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,400
Still taking place in what is
the saddest man cave ever assembled.

3
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,600
It's been a busy week,
from prominent Twitter accounts

4
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,240
getting targeted in a Bitcoin scam

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,720
to federal agents shoving Portland
protestors into unmarked cars,

6
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,680
to the Trumps becoming
the first family of legumes.

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,160
But we're gonna begin tonight
with the coronavirus,

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,520
the disease
that's wreaking havoc on...

9
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,960
Wait a minute. Is that cake?
God damn it! Fuck you, cake!

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,680
Everything can't be you!

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,600
Sadly, here in the US,
Covid cases have continued to climb

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,000
and a debate over what to do about
schools has been dominating the news,

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,000
after kicking into high gear
a little over a week ago.

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,880
President Trump tonight once again
at odds with his own medical experts

15
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,600
as he continues to relentlessly
push America's schools to reopen.

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,840
Our schools,
we want 'em open in the fall.

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,120
He's also threatening
to defund schools that don't open,

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,040
though he has
little power to do so

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,400
and criticizing the CDC's school
safety guidelines,

20
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,720
calling them
"very tough & expensive."

21
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,240
We don't want the guidance
from CDC

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,440
to be a reason
why schools don't open.

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,920
Pence doesn't think CDC guidelines
should impede schools opening?

24
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,320
Then what exactly are they for?
These are public health guidelines.

25
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,000
Shouldn't be skimmed through
and deemed inconsequential

26
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,400
to our current situation,
they're not Mary Trump's book.

27
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,080
Trump administration's insistence
that schools should reopen full-time,

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,120
for in-person learning,
regardless of local virus spread,

29
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,240
has prompted questions like:
What? How? The fuck?

30
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,280
And the fuck??? again,
but with more question marks.

31
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,800
Some in the administration
claim it shouldn't be an issue.

32
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,240
Just go back to school.
We can do that.

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,520
You can social distance, you can
get your temperature taken,

34
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,400
you can be tested,
you can have distancing.

35
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,120
Come on, it's not that hard.

36
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,200
Okay, real quick: fuck you,
Larry Kudlow, you human cufflink.

37
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,960
You can't tell people
to "Just go back to school"

38
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,240
without answering questions around
how that can happen safely.

39
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,320
The only questions that Kudlow's
answering effectively there is:

40
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,200
what would it would look like
if someone made Rudy Giuliani

41
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,240
exactly zero-point-zero-zero-one
percent hotter?

42
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,200
Safely reopening schools
is going to be incredibly hard.

43
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,400
They are not designed
for social distancing

44
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,840
and years of budget cuts
and the economic downturn

45
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,080
are gonna make it difficult
for them to upgrade their facilities.

46
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,560
While this administration
has repeatedly implied

47
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,920
that kids are at low risk
of severe illness:

48
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,240
A, we absolutely do not know that,

49
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,680
and B, you know schools
don't just contain children, right?

50
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,720
Lots of adults work in schools,
many of whom are vulnerable.

51
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,640
In fact, nearly a third of K through
12 teachers may be at higher risk

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,680
because they're over 50,

53
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,280
some of whom are painfully aware
of the risks they're about to take.

54
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,640
Mary Strickland has been
teaching middle school 22 years

55
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,800
and she loves it.

56
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,520
But the sign outside her Fort Worth
home describes how the 53-year-old

57
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,760
feels about going back: terrified.

58
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,760
Fearing the worst,
she's making end of life plans.

59
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,560
I'm very concerned about my health,
about my life

60
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,760
and that's why my husband
and I decided to write our wills.

61
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,400
That's awful. Teachers should not go
to work scared they might die.

62
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,656
They should be scared
of the usual teacher things,

63
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,280
like not making
enough money to eat

64
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,160
or being made into a TikTok meme
by one of their students.

65
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,760
"I bent over in front of the skeleton
to pick up my pencil"

66
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,760
"and now 10 million people
are watching a video"

67
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,760
"of me getting drilled doggy style by
a bone man to 'Old Town Road'."

68
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,480
"I hate my fucking life."

69
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,760
This is a tough, complicated situation
that requires nuanced thinking.

70
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,320
Which is why it's so maddening

71
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,680
to see it reduced
to talking points like this.

72
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,160
I can promise you
for many of our kids,

73
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,080
keeping these schools closed
is gonna hurt them

74
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,640
far more worse
than the coronavirus can.

75
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,680
- France, Germany...
- Go ahead, sir.

76
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,920
Denmark, Austria, Vietnam...

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Even Vietnam
has opened their schools.

78
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,160
And they've done it safely
and we can too and we should too.

79
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,920
First of all,
the senator is rocking a look there

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,880
that can only be described
as open casket realness.

81
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,000
But second,
he can sneer all he wants

82
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,000
about how other countries
have done this, "even Vietnam!"

83
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,720
But the fact is, they've reopened
under very different circumstances:

84
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,160
gradually, and when daily case
rates were low and dropping.

85
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,040
When Vietnam
reopened their schools,

86
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,160
it had seen no community infections
for nearly a month.

87
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,760
Whereas our new daily cases have
reached 77 000 and are rising.

88
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,240
But I will give him this:

89
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,840
there is real harm in not
being able to reopen schools.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
At-home learning
is a poor substitute,

91
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,600
especially for those
with limited internet access

92
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,480
or who require specialized support

93
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,280
and some kids rely on schools for
important resources, like meals.

94
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,040
Parents are burdened, especially
those who can't work remotely

95
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,440
and who have few options
when it comes to childcare,

96
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,760
a stress that falls disproportionately
on women, especially women of color.

97
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,440
Even those lucky enough
to be able to work from home

98
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,920
are finding this stressful and badly
want their kids back in school.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,600
Trust me. I love my kids
more than anything,

100
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,240
but I'd send them
to go study in Jake Paul's house

101
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,480
if it meant I could
have my mornings back.

102
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,880
But we haven't made the issue
of schools reopening a priority,

103
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,280
something actually best summed up
by Florida governor Ron DeSantis,

104
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,480
whose state is pumping out cases faster
than just about anywhere right now.

105
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,520
Listen to him explaining why
reopening schools has to be done,

106
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,200
for the sake of consistency.

107
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,800
We spent months saying

108
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,400
that there were certain things
that were essential.

109
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,080
That included fast-food
restaurants, it included Walmart,

110
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,680
it included Home Depot.

111
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,360
If that is essential, then educating
our kids is absolutely essential.

112
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,560
And they have been put to the back
of the line in some respects.

113
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,960
He's actually right, there.
We have prioritized things

114
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,520
like opening restaurants and bars
ahead of our children.

115
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,760
And many advised that we go
a lot slower, while unfortunately

116
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,720
the Ron DeSanti of the world
ignored that advice,

117
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,200
saying things like: "go enjoy.
Have a drink. It's fine."

118
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,280
It is almost impressive to watch
a sitting governor

119
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,760
try and make the argument:
"We were really dumb then,"

120
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,040
"so the only fair thing
is to also be really dumb now."

121
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,160
Schools clearly
don't exist in a vacuum.

122
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,880
And the best way to reopen
schools safely is,

123
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,800
if I may quote Ashish Jha, the director
of the Harvard Global Health Institute:

124
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,240
"Live in a community that doesn't
have a big disease outbreak."

125
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,520
"That's how you open up
schools safely."

126
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,480
So many of the decisions
that could make schools safe

127
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,160
involve what we all do
outside of them.

128
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,480
The frustrating thing is,

129
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,640
the government could be
really helping there,

130
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,600
with consistent messaging
on the importance of wearing masks

131
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,840
and possibly reclosing
some non-essential businesses,

132
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,280
while making sure people are paid
a living wage to stay at home.

133
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,680
Because our response here
is only going to be as strong

134
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,960
as our weakest link
and other countries,

135
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,600
France, Germany, Denmark,
Austria, even Vietnam, know this.

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,800
Why? Because understanding is,
if I may quote Larry Kudlow,

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,880
not that fucking hard.

138
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,440
And now, this.

139
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,720
Parents On Television
Just Want One Thing.

140
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,040
I'm gonna out myself as pro-school,
pro-if it is open, I will send her.

141
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,560
I'm just trying to get people
to take my children.

142
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,880
Take my kids back!

143
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,600
That was one of those surveys
that they sent out and I sent it,

144
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,960
I said:
"Take my kids! Take 'em", I said.

145
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,600
Please take my children.

146
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We gotta get our daughter out of
the house. She drives us crazy.

147
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,800
Please send my kids back.
Please send my kids back to school!

148
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,480
You're having a day there, aren't you,
in the Kammerer household?

149
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,720
- You heard that earlier?
- Yeah, I heard that.

150
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,600
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns conspiracy theories,

151
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,640
voted definitely true
by "Dipshit Uncle Quarterly".

152
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,400
You're probably familiar with
at least some conspiracy theories,

153
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,400
like the claim that
the moon landing was faked

154
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,840
or the argument that the earth is flat
and that scientists are covering it up.

155
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,440
And that is a theory that led to
this stunning YouTube video.

156
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,480
Operation Fish Bowl.

157
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,600
There Never Was A South Pole.

158
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,360
We're Surrounded By Walls Of Ice

159
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:45,440
And We Clearly Live
Inside Of A Glass Dome.

160
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,800
Magnificent.

161
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,720
And putting aside the factual
inaccuracies, slant rhymes,

162
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,280
shoehorned lyrics and the bad
Adele or solid Björk impression,

163
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,560
my favorite part of that
is the comment:

164
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,640
"Holy crap this is amazing!
I'll share this around the world!"

165
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,520
Which is, quite simply, perfect.
But as you've probably guessed,

166
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,400
the reason that we need to talk
about this is that the coronavirus

167
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,240
has created a perfect storm
for conspiracy theorists.

168
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,800
Because their theories
are now everywhere.

169
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,560
Over the last few weeks,
some people have been saying online

170
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,760
that the virus is harmless
or even that it doesn't exist.

171
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,280
Numerous sites and groups online
have been falsely claiming

172
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,960
that this virus is a result of
some sort of biological warfare,

173
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,080
some sort of bioweapon,
or even created

174
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,480
by the pharmaceutical industry
to try to sell more vaccines.

175
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,360
One particularly persistent falsehood?
5G mobile networks transmit Covid-19.

176
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,360
When they turn this on,
it's gonna kill everyone?

177
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,840
A woman in Britain called workers
killers for laying fiberoptic cables.

178
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,120
When they turn that switch on,
bye-bye, mama.

179
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,960
There is so much wrong there,
but most of all,

180
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,280
the only time an English person should
be saying: "Bye-bye mama",

181
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,080
is when they're physically
leaving the womb.

182
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,560
"Bye-bye, mama.
Thank you for an excellent delivery."

183
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,520
And after that it's:
"Yes, mom. No, mom"

184
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,520
and, "Thank you kindly for wiping off
my shameful buttocks, much obliged."

185
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,440
And those theories
are just the tip of the iceberg here.

186
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,280
You might have seen this video
of two doctors making

187
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,360
a now-debunked claim that
Covid death rates were exaggerated,

188
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,080
because it was all over Facebook
a couple of months ago.

189
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,080
Or maybe
you came across "Plandemic",

190
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,840
a pseudo-documentary filled with
a hodgepodge of conspiracy theories.

191
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,400
In just one week, it was viewed
over eight million times.

192
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,560
Which is a shockingly high number
because that means it's been seen

193
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,920
more times than this TikTok
of a cat matching a piano's pitch.

194
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,080
Good cat.
You deserve more views.

195
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,840
And the problem is,
some online theories

196
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,080
have already prompted
some worrying real-world actions.

197
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,080
Take the hashtag
♪FilmYourHospital,

198
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,040
which spread after some claimed
that the severity of the pandemic

199
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,400
was being exaggerated
and urged people to expose the truth.

200
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,400
That led to videos like this one,
where a man angrily demands

201
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,000
hospital staff show him
their coronavirus patients

202
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,320
and then shouts at them
as he drives away.

203
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,840
Maybe you could call the governor
and tell him about the hoax.

204
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,880
- Take care, sir.
- Are you serious?

205
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,600
Yeah, it's a hoax.

206
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,480
Where's all the patients?
Where's the lines of sick people?

207
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,320
They don't sit in our lobby.

208
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,960
Yeah, she's right. Can you imagine
how confused that man is

209
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,880
whenever he tries
to check into a hotel?

210
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,840
No vacancy?
Where are all the guests?

211
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,440
Where are the depressed salesmen

212
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,240
attempting autoerotic asphyxiation
in your lobby?

213
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,240
Call the governor
of this Best Western

214
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,320
and tell him your sign is a hoax.

215
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,720
And the harms of conspiracy
theories during a pandemic

216
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,240
go far beyond confused
hospital workers,

217
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,040
as one study pointed out,
given the transmissibility of Covid-19,

218
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,680
these beliefs are dangerous even if
only a fraction of Americans

219
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,560
succumbing to them ignore best
practices, such as social distancing.

220
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Let's talk about
conspiracy theories, particularly,

221
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,000
why they're so appealing,
how to spot them

222
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,080
and what you might be able
to do about it.

223
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,480
And let's start with the fact

224
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,920
that these theories are a lot more
popular than you might think.

225
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,760
Polls over the years have shown
that over half of Americans

226
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,760
consistently endorse at least one sort
of conspiratorial narrative.

227
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,560
And look, I'm not immune here.

228
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,360
Embarrassingly,
there is a part of me

229
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,160
that thinks the royal family
had Princess Diana killed.

230
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,480
I know that they didn't because there's
absolutely no evidence that they did.

231
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,680
But the idea still lingers.

232
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,720
Because it felt too big an event
to be accidental,

233
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,840
there had to be some intent there.

234
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,200
And experts will say that that is
a huge draw of conspiracy theories.

235
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,640
They help explain a chaotic,
uncertain world,

236
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,680
and appeal to the human impulse to
what's called proportionality bias,

237
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,080
which is the tendency to assume that
big events must have big causes.

238
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,640
Take the JFK assassination.
That event shook the world

239
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,280
and the very idea that a lone gunman
could cause such chaos

240
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,120
was inherently unsatisfying,
so people, perhaps understandably,

241
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,960
reached for a much bigger answer.

242
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,080
Although, it is revealing that,
conversely,

243
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,200
less impactful events have attracted
significantly less speculation.

244
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,720
The attempted assassination
of Ronald Reagan

245
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,520
was a similar event in all regards,
except that the president survived.

246
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,640
It was a smaller event
in terms of its outcome,

247
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,600
and therefore, we're satisfied
with smaller explanations.

248
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,240
There have been almost
no conspiracy theories

249
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,400
about the attempted assassination
of Ronald Reagan

250
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,480
either at the time or subsequently.

251
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,440
Exactly. And that
kind of makes sense, doesn't it?

252
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,040
'Cause one man suddenly changing
the world is inconceivable.

253
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,320
One man failing miserably
isn't remotely surprising.

254
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,880
Something which is, incidentally,
also the tagline for feminism.

255
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,480
These theories have undeniable appeal
and they've actually been

256
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,760
particularly seductive
during global health crises.

257
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,320
In the 14th-century,
conspiracy theorists claimed

258
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,320
that Jewish people were responsible
for the bubonic plague.

259
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,320
In 1890, a newspaper claims
the electric light was responsible

260
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,200
for a global influenza outbreak.

261
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,320
And in 1918,

262
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,520
rumors spread that the German
pharmaceutical company Bayer

263
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,600
tainted its U.S.-sold aspirin tablets
with the so-called Spanish flu.

264
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,360
The only difference now

265
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,600
is that our current pandemic
is coming in the age of the internet,

266
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,680
when it's not only easier
for people

267
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,880
to do bad research
and spread their results,

268
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,400
it's also possible for them
to make material look authoritative.

269
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,880
In fact, take "Plandemic."
At first view,

270
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,640
it looks like a high-budget
true-crime documentary,

271
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,080
with fancy graphics
and drone footage.

272
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,320
And it deploys those techniques
to tell the story of Judy Mikovits,

273
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,880
a former scientist at
the National Cancer Institute,

274
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,160
who's depicted as a whistleblower
on the scientific establishment.

275
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,480
Here is how the film presents
a key moment in Mikovits's narrative,

276
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,240
where she claims that her enemies
had her arrested without cause.

277
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
And so what
did they charge you with?

278
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,520
- Nothing.
- But you were in jail?

279
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,080
I was held in jail with no charges.
I was called a fugitive from justice.

280
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,760
No warrant. Literally drug
me out of the house.

281
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,640
Our neighbors are looking
at what's going on here.

282
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,080
They search my house
without a warrant.

283
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,480
That looks pretty compelling there.
The police surrounding her house,

284
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,600
using violent force, and eventually
throwing her in jail without cause.

285
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,000
A few things you should know.
First, she was criminally charged.

286
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,480
As stated in a lawsuit that she herself
later filed over the arrest:

287
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,240
"Mikovits was arrested
on criminal charges."

288
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,040
When a reporter
pointed this out to her,

289
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,401
she said she meant the charges
were later dropped, adding:

290
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,080
"I've been confused for a decade"

291
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,560
and that "I'll try
to learn to say it differently."

292
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,640
Second, while that arrest
footage looks dramatic,

293
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,320
it is not actually
from her arrest at all.

294
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,120
It's from an unrelated SWAT raid
and is the first result you get

295
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,320
when you search "house raid"
on a stock footage website.

296
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,000
Which is just ridiculous, 'cause if
they'd simply worked a little harder

297
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,480
and searched "house raid"
on other stock footage sites,

298
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,960
they could have found this video of
a masked robber spanking himself,

299
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,400
then flipping the bird
and dancing around like a maniac.

300
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,280
And that's not just objectively
better than the clip they chose,

301
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,680
it's also exactly as relevant.

302
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,280
And the issue isn't just that the film
misrepresents Mikovits's backstory,

303
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,640
it's that, in doing so,
they lend her an air of credibility

304
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,680
when they allow her
to make unchallenged,

305
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,720
batshit medical claims like these.

306
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,440
Wearing the mask literally
activates your own virus.

307
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,640
You're getting sick from your own
reactivated, coronavirus expressions.

308
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,600
And if it happens to be SARS-CoV-2,
then you've got a big problem.

309
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,040
Why would you close the beach?

310
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,960
You've got sequences in the soil,
in the sand.

311
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,760
You've got healing microbes
in the ocean, in the salt water.

312
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,400
That's insanity.

313
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,440
Yes! It is! Everything
that you just said is insane.

314
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,720
The idea that wearing a mask activates
your own virus is absurd.

315
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,880
In debunking it, PolitiFact said:
"There is no evidence to support this"

316
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,840
and then threw in: "We're not sure
what a 'coronavirus expression' is."

317
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,880
As for the idea that there are healing
microbes at the beach:

318
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,976
I don't want to be the depressing guy
that tells you

319
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,800
going to the beach
won't cure coronavirus.

320
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,360
But I will say, the beach
is exactly three things,

321
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,800
none of which are medicine.

322
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,680
It's sand that goes down
your ass-crack,

323
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,720
salt water that gets up your nose
and sun that burns your skin.

324
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,840
The beach doesn't cure anything
except you being comfortable.

325
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,200
Incidentally: when we reached out
to the director of "Plandemic"

326
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,640
to cite our many issues
with the film, he wrote back,

327
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,200
not only saying that he stands
behind it, but asking:

328
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,400
"In a country that marches to the chant
of 'believe all women',"

329
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,800
"why is it that people are so quick
to disbelieve Dr. Mikovits?"

330
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,560
To which the answer is, obviously:

331
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,680
A, because she's telling people good
coronavirus prevention involves

332
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,120
not wearing a mask
and going boogie boarding.

333
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,240
B, the phrase is "believe women"
not "believe all women".

334
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,840
And, C, that's not what that phrase
is about

335
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,600
because the point
of the movement is not:

336
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,520
"We all have to take Rachel Dolezal
at her fucking word now."

337
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,760
And look, I am well aware that,
for some,

338
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,280
even these criticisms of "Plandemic"
will somehow be further proof

339
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,840
that what it's saying is true.

340
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,160
That is actually a common trait
of conspiracy theories,

341
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,240
that they're "inherently selfsealing",

342
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,040
with any criticism just becoming
evidence that the whole thing

343
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,120
is bigger
than anyone could've imagined.

344
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,040
Although,
I will simply say this,

345
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,800
if I am in on this conspiracy, that
means my puppet master is AT&T.

346
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,120
And what makes you think that
they can pull off a global conspiracy

347
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,600
when they can barely pull off
a complete phone call?

348
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,760
How would they even be
sending me orders? Sprint?

349
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,120
The point is, these theories
can be innately appealing

350
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,120
and, thanks to the internet,
can spread with ease.

351
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,200
All of this would be dangerous enough
before you take into account

352
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,440
that one of the most prominent
spreaders of conspiracies on earth

353
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,120
is the current
President of the United States.

354
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,440
'Cause he's been spreading them
around for years,

355
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,720
often with the excuse that
"people are saying" them

356
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,520
and he's "just asking questions".

357
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,480
Something he's done on bullshit
claims like "Obama was born in Kenya",

358
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,280
"Antonin Scalia was murdered"

359
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,160
and that millions of fake votes
were cast for Hillary Clinton.

360
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,160
Conspiracies are like ugly buildings
and deeply tragic adult children,

361
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,720
in that Donald Trump loves
to unleash them into the world

362
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,840
and then refuse to take responsibility
for them ever again.

363
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,320
And he's been doing this
throughout the pandemic,

364
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,560
including this week, when he retweeted
a theory that the CDC and the media

365
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,920
are lying about the virus
to hurt his re-election chances.

366
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,280
Trump has passed on so many
conspiracies that news outlets

367
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,640
have repeatedly called him
the "Conspiracy Theorist in Chief".

368
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,040
I would argue he's not invested
in these things that he's spreading,

369
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,920
he's only interested in amplifying

370
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,560
whatever he thinks he might
personally benefit from.

371
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,600
I can not believe I'm saying this,
but the person with the clearest sense

372
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,640
of just how deeply cynical Trump's use
of conspiracy theories is, is this guy.

373
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,280
When you get to Trump
and his conspiracy theories,

374
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,520
he does it
in a really clever way.

375
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,640
Trump never says that he believes
these conspiracy theories

376
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,640
that he touts,
he's simply passing them on.

377
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,800
It's his way of jamming 'em up,
of teasing 'em,

378
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,920
it's his way of getting these
conspiracy theories out there.

379
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,720
So, Trump is just throwing
gasoline on a fire here.

380
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,720
And he's having fun
watching the flames.

381
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,760
Yeah, Rush Limbaugh gets it. That's
a sentence I never thought I'd say

382
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,720
unless I was talking about
toilet transmitted chlamydia.

383
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,120
But the thing is,
right now in particular,

384
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,800
there is real harm
in throwing gasoline on the fire,

385
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,080
because people
are going to get burned,

386
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,320
making those flames
not quite as fucking fun to watch.

387
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,800
Because make no mistake here,
people who have been convinced

388
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,360
that Covid was overblown
have sometimes paid a steep price.

389
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,280
Around this time last month,
Jupiter rideshare driver Brian Hitchens

390
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,040
was a self-proclaimed
Covid-19 skeptic.

391
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,920
I thought it was maybe the government
was trying something that...

392
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:01,320
And it was kind of like they threw it
out there to kind of distract us.

393
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,880
Fast forward to this week

394
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,920
and Hitchens has a whole new outlook
from his hospital bed.

395
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,280
This is a real virus
that you've got to take serious.

396
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,520
My wife's on the ventilator.
She's been like that for three weeks.

397
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,120
And it's tough, it's sad.

398
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,040
Yeah, it is sad.
And unfortunately,

399
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,520
I don't think he's gonna be
the last person in this country

400
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,480
to learn that a lot of what's on
the internet is bullshit, the hard way.

401
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,800
What can we do here? Social
media companies are finally doing

402
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,040
more to label conspiracy theories
or limit their spread.

403
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,360
But the truth is,
they can only do so much.

404
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,040
They don't always have the expertise
to litigate what is and isn't true.

405
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,240
And the sheer volume
of material flying around

406
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,160
makes it almost impossible
for them to catch everything.

407
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,880
And that's actually been
a challenge for us in this story, too.

408
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,600
We are clearly only scratching
the surface of what is out there.

409
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,680
If you look down at the comments
section when this is on YouTube,

410
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,000
you will find people saying:

411
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,520
"How about the fact the virus
was created as a bioweapon?"

412
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,200
or "What about Bill Gates's
plan to microchip me?"

413
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,080
And it would take days to go through
why each one of those is bullshit

414
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,200
and it still won't address
the ones that come up

415
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,880
in the weeks
and the months ahead.

416
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,760
The fact is, it's gonna be incumbent
on us as individuals to try

417
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,840
and spot these theories and treat
them with a skeptical eye

418
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,800
before we believe them or
indeed spread them around.

419
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,280
And there are actually three basic
questions that you can ask yourself.

420
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,920
First: is there a rational,
non-conspiracy explanation?

421
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,720
Remember the theory 5G towers
are spreading coronavirus?

422
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,200
Or, as that one woman
so memorably phrased it...

423
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,480
When they turn that switch on,
bye-bye, mama.

424
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,080
Exactly. It made the rounds,
helped by images like these,

425
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,040
showing maps of coronavirus cases
alongside maps of the 5G rollout.

426
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,480
And initially, the similarity there
does seem striking until you realize

427
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,680
those maps also look like ones
of population density,

428
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,720
which makes a lot more sense.

429
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,560
Because, that's correlation,
not causation.

430
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,240
Wi-Fi rollouts and virus cases will
be where there are a lot of people.

431
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,920
In fact, lots of maps
look like those maps.

432
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,200
This one of Domino's Pizza locations
looks like a map of outbreaks.

433
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,120
I'm pretty sure Domino's Pizza
isn't causing it.

434
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,640
Yes, their Wisconsin 6 Cheese
will give you a dry cough, fever,

435
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,960
diarrhea and Covid toe but not in
the same way as the coronavirus.

436
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,600
And knowing the difference
is called science.

437
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,800
The second question
you could ask is:

438
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,320
"Has this been held up
to scrutiny by experts?"

439
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,760
"And if so,
what did those experts say?"

440
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,720
Because it's not uncommon
for theories to cite a single source,

441
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,560
a doctor or scientist, like severely
Midwestern Diane Keaton here,

442
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,280
making an outlandish claim.

443
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,960
But, it's worth checking

444
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,080
if most credible doctors
or scientists agree with them.

445
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,240
If you're thinking:

446
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,840
"What if all of them are in
on the cover-up, too?"

447
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,600
That actually brings us
to our final question here:

448
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,360
"How plausible is this conspiracy,
as a practical matter?"

449
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,240
Because not every conspiracy theory
is fictional.

450
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,560
Obviously, some have absolutely
turned out to be true.

451
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,920
But the very fact that we know
about the real ones

452
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,080
actually teaches us
something important.

453
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,800
One study looked
at real government secrets

454
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,520
like Edward Snowden's revelations
about government surveillance

455
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,680
and found the reason they unraveled

456
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,400
was because of the sheer number
of people who had to keep them secret.

457
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,680
They created an equation to predict

458
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,400
how quickly other science-based
conspiracy theories

459
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,360
would have unraveled
had they been true,

460
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,560
finding that faking the moon landing,
for instance,

461
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,400
would've required an estimated
411 000 people to keep quiet

462
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,440
and would've broken down in just
over three and a half years.

463
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,880
Which does make sense,
doesn't it?

464
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,480
Think just how many people
would have to be sworn to secrecy

465
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,720
to keep
a coronavirus hoax under wraps.

466
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,960
I don't know if you've ever tried
to organize a mid-size surprise party

467
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,600
for your cousin but it's borderline
impossible to keep it quiet.

468
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,440
'Cause someone is telling Roxanne.
No matter how many emails

469
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,040
you've sent saying:
"NO ONE TELL ROXANNE!"

470
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,600
Roxanne is finding out.

471
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,320
I know you may not find
conspiracy theories plausible,

472
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,240
but you also
may know people who do.

473
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,800
While you can't reach everyone,
you can reach some.

474
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,400
Now more than ever, it might be
important for you to try.

475
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,840
Which clearly is not easy,
it is completely natural

476
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,480
to simply want to scream at them:

477
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,400
"Why do you believe this nonsense,
you titanic fucking idiot?"

478
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,040
I would say:
"Just show them this piece",

479
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,600
but obviously
I'm not the best messenger.

480
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,480
Within in the first 20 seconds,
I called your uncle a dipshit.

481
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,080
And dipshits tend
not to like that.

482
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,400
What experts say
is that the most effective way

483
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,920
to approach someone is not by shaming
them for believing something

484
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,800
or overwhelming them with counter
evidence but to try and be empathetic,

485
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,400
meet them where they are

486
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,960
and nudge them
to think a bit more critically.

487
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,440
So, to that end,
we've asked some people

488
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,760
that they might be more
willing to listen to,

489
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,600
to help you start a conversation.

490
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,400
For instance, let's say
your confused grandparents

491
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,760
are passing around misinformation
about not wearing a mask.

492
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,320
They may not listen to me,
but they might listen to the man

493
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,760
that they've been letting into
their home every weeknight

494
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,480
to calmly tell them
what is and isn't correct.

495
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,600
Hi everyone, the answer is:
Alex Trebek.

496
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,120
The correct question, of course:

497
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,080
"Who is that handsome man
I'm looking at right now?"

498
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,440
Yeah. We got Alex Trebek
to make a 90-second video,

499
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,520
gently urging anyone who watches it
to be careful

500
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
with what they encounter
and share online.

501
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,960
So, you could show your grandparents
that and then talk to them about it.

502
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,520
But, let's say you've got a cousin
who's not a "Jeopardy" fan.

503
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,120
Maybe they like wrestling
or "Fast & Furious" movies.

504
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,960
Well the good news is, John Cena
has got something to say to them, too.

505
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,200
There's a lot of official-looking
stuff on the internet.

506
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,600
Not all of it's true. And there's
some stuff that seems false,

507
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,000
but isn't, like this one: John Oliver
and I are the exact same age.

508
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,800
Born on the same year,
on the exact same day.

509
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,480
It seems impossible that two human
bodies can age so differently,

510
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,400
but it's true, I checked!

511
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,800
And it's important you do that.

512
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Before you go believe any theory
about the pandemic

513
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,880
or share any information
about the pandemic,

514
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,600
it's good to know
where that information's coming from.

515
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,720
Yeah.
Both of those things he said are true.

516
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,960
You should check information
you see online

517
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,560
and we are the exact same age.

518
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,320
It's a thing that I think
about every birthday.

519
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,800
And it's not just Alex Trebek
and John Cena.

520
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,040
We have an assortment
of truly beloved figures,

521
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,080
from Paul Rudd to Catherine O'Hara
to Billy Porter,

522
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,360
each of whom made messages to urge
people to think more critically.

523
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,640
Here is just a taste.

524
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,160
What's going on, my people?
It's me, Billy Porter.

525
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,080
Hello there,
I'm Catherine O'Hara.

526
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,280
I'm Paul Rudd.

527
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,480
Alex Trebek.

528
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,600
John Cena here, WWE superstar,
actor, internet meme, dessert lover

529
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,280
and number three
on your partner's free pass list.

530
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,880
I'm literally a superhero,
the smallest one, but it still counts.

531
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,560
I know
that we are living in scary times.

532
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,120
Given the current state of things,

533
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,520
you're searching for answers
about the global health crisis.

534
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,000
That's awesome.

535
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,560
That curiosity, that's good.
I'm curious, too.

536
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,760
If nobody ever asked questions,

537
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,440
"Jeopardy" would be a very,
very weird show, wouldn't it?

538
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,120
But you have to be careful

539
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,160
'cause there's a lot of convincing
looking shit on the internet

540
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,960
and most of it ain't true.

541
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,800
I once thought I was dead because
hashtag ♪RIPPaulRudd was trending.

542
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,520
Before you go off and share something
with your friends and family...

543
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,736
It's good to know where
that information's coming from.

544
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,160
Is it a trusted news source?

545
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,880
If you're not sure, look to see

546
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,440
if other trusted news sources and
experts are saying the same thing.

547
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,680
A good way to know if an idea or story
that you've read about holds water

548
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,040
is if a majority
of trusted sources agree on it.

549
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,880
And finally, think critically.

550
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,760
You're smart.

551
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,040
You're a smart cookie,
I know you are.

552
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,760
You have the look of a scholar
and the taste of a macaron.

553
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,760
Y'all got brains, use 'em! Use it like
it's the first roll of toilet paper

554
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,440
in a brand-new pack,
unsparingly and with gusto.

555
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,240
You have common sense,
trust that part of your brain

556
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,120
to guide you as you educate yourself
during this difficult time.

557
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,040
Trust that I'm doing what I can
to hop to number one

558
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,360
on your partner's free pass list
and number three on yours.

559
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,400
Be safe out there.

560
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,400
That's good advice!
To increase the chance

561
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,560
that conspiracy
theorists stumble on them,

562
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,880
we've put their full videos online
at TheTrueTrueTruth-dot-com.

563
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,176
And if you're looking to start
a conversation with someone,

564
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,280
picking one of these videos
is a pretty good entry point.

565
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,040
That is our show. Thank you.
We'll see you next week. Good night!

566
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,200
Get comfortable. Take off your shoes.
I want to talk to you one-on-one.
