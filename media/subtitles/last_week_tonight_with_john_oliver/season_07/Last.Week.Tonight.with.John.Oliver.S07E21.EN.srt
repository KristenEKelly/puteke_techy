1
00:00:24,467 --> 00:00:26,800
HI THERE!

2
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:28,300
WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

3
00:00:28,367 --> 00:00:29,734
TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK VOID

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,133
THAT HAS ALL THE DESIGN

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,467
AESTHETICS OF HEAVEN WITH ALL

6
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,867
THE DEPRESSING VIBES OF HELL.

7
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:35,200
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK, FROM

8
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:36,500
TRUMP ADMITTING TO SABOTAGING

9
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:37,807
THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE TO MAKE

10
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:39,367
MAIL-IN VOTING MORE DIFFICULT TO

11
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:40,066
HERMAN CAIN SOMEHOW TWEETING

12
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:41,734
FROM THE DEAD.

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
BUT THE BIG NEWS WAS

14
00:00:42,867 --> 00:00:43,910
KAMALA HARRIS BEING ANNOUNCED AS

15
00:00:43,934 --> 00:00:45,567
BIDEN'S RUNNING MATE, A DECISION

16
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:46,967
THAT SENT CONSERVATIVES

17
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:48,166
SCRAMBLING FOR ATTACK

18
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:49,934
STRATEGIES, FROM CLAIMING IT'S

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,333
AN EXTREME, FAR-LEFT TICKET...

20
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,233
WHICH IT ABSOLUTELY ISN'T... TO

21
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,233
A BASELESS ACCUSATION THAT SHE

22
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,433
MAY NOT MEET THE CITIZENSHIP

23
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,710
REQUIREMENTS TO HOLD THE OFFICE,

24
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:01,300
DESPITE BEING VERY MUCH BORN IN

25
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:02,300
THE UNITED STATES.

26
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:03,867
IT'S A DEPRESSING RESURGENCE OF

27
00:01:03,934 --> 00:01:04,767
BIRTHERISM, SO OF COURSE TRUMP

28
00:01:04,834 --> 00:01:08,500
JUMPED ALL OVER IT.

29
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:10,567
I HEARD IT TODAY THAT

30
00:01:10,633 --> 00:01:12,333
SHE DOESN'T MEET THE

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,667
REQUIREMENTS AND, BY THE WAY,

32
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:15,567
THE LAWYER THAT WROTE THAT PIECE

33
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:16,910
IS A VERY HIGHLY QUALIFIED, VERY

34
00:01:16,934 --> 00:01:18,367
TALENTED LAWYER.

35
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:24,867
I HAVE NO IDEA IF THAT'S RIGHT.

36
00:01:24,934 --> 00:01:25,633
OH, I'LL TELL YOU IF

37
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,166
IT'S RIGHT.

38
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:26,734
IT FUCKING ISN'T.

39
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,700
IT'S AMAZING HOW SLOW TRUMP IS

40
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:28,633
TO RESPOND TO MANY THINGS, LIKE,

41
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,743
I DUNNO, PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES,

42
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:34,033
YET WHEN IT COMES TO AMPLIFYING

43
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,734
RACIST CONSPIRACY THEORIES

44
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,633
SUDDENLY HE'S THE FUCKING FLASH

45
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,200
ON COCAINE.

46
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:38,276
AND SADLY, IT WASN'T EVEN THE

47
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:38,800
ONLY CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT

48
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:39,734
STAINED THIS WEEK, AS TUESDAY

49
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,500
SAW A STUNNING RESULT IN A

50
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,767
CONGRESSIONAL PRIMARY.

51
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:42,900
BUSINESSWOMAN MARJORIE

52
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:44,433
TAYLOR GREENE IS NOW THE HEAVY

53
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,900
FAVORITE TO WIN A SEAT

54
00:01:45,967 --> 00:01:47,633
REPRESENTING A DEEPLY

55
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,834
CONSERVATIVE DISTRICT IN

56
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,300
NORTHWEST GEORGIA.

57
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:51,734
GREENE HAS REPEATEDLY PRAISED

58
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
THE QANON THEORY.

59
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:54,133
Q IS A PATRIOT.

60
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,667
WE KNOW THAT FOR SURE.

61
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:59,066
BUT WE DO NOT KNOW WHO Q IS.

62
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:01,200
PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT Q IS SOMEONE

63
00:02:01,266 --> 00:02:03,367
VERY CLOSE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP.

64
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:05,233
OH, GREAT.

65
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,433
JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT 2020

66
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,800
COULDN'T GET ANY WORSE, WHAT

67
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:09,133
WITH THE PANDEMIC AND

68
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,433
MURDER HORNETS, NOW SOMEONE

69
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,600
WHO'S OPENLY ENDORSED A

70
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:12,834
CONSPIRACY THEORY HAS WON A

71
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,767
CONGRESSIONAL PRIMARY.

72
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:15,500
AND THAT IS ALARMING.

73
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:16,900
WHEN YOUR DRUNK AUNT IS FOUR

74
00:02:16,967 --> 00:02:17,767
WINE AND TONICS DEEP, THRASHING

75
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:18,400
HER PASHMINA AROUND THE

76
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:19,333
THANKSGIVING TABLE SCREAMING

77
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,533
"JET FUEL CAN'T MELT STEEL

78
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,567
BEAMS," YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT

79
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:23,500
THINKING, "I WISH THE FATE OF

80
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:24,867
THE STIMULUS PACKAGE COULD BE IN

81
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:26,467
HER HANDS."

82
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:27,967
AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH

83
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:32,700
TO NOT KNOW WHAT QANON IS AND

84
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:35,300
YOU'RE THINKING, "LET ME GOOGLE

85
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:35,767
THAT"... PLEASE DON'T.

86
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:36,843
BECAUSE MUCH LIKE "JOE ROGAN NET

87
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:37,433
WORTH," OR "JOHN OLIVER HENTAI,"

88
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,333
GOOGLING QANON IS GOING TO GET

89
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,767
YOU SOME VERY UPSETTING RESULTS.

90
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:41,767
THE CONSPIRACY INVOLVES A RANGE

91
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:43,100
OF BATSHIT THEORIES, BUT VERY

92
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,700
BASICALLY, MANY QANON SUPPORTERS

93
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:46,967
BELIEVE IN "A GLOBAL CONSPIRACY

94
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:47,767
INVOLVING A RING OF

95
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,500
SATAN-WORSHIPING,

96
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:50,847
CHILD-MOLESTING CRIMINALS LED BY

97
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,100
PROMINENT DEMOCRATS" THAT

98
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,200
INCLUDES EVERYONE FROM

99
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:54,633
HILLARY CLINTON TO TOM HANKS TO

100
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,133
A MEXICAN CEMENT COMPANY.

101
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,600
THEY ALSO BELIEVE INFORMATION

102
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:59,233
ABOUT IT IS BEING LEAKED VIA

103
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,100
CRYPTIC POSTS ON THE INTERNET BY

104
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,867
SOMEONE WITH VERY HIGH "Q" -LEVEL

105
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:04,300
SECURITY CLEARANCE, WHICH SOUNDS

106
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:07,233
JUST AS MADE UP AS IT IS, AND

107
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,376
APPARENTLY, THE MAIN PERSON

108
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,300
WHO'S WORKING TO ROOT OUT

109
00:03:10,367 --> 00:03:11,600
THE SATANIST PEDOPHILES IS

110
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:12,843
DONALD TRUMP, WHICH IS A LITTLE

111
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:14,333
WEIRD, BECAUSE...

112
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,300
Y'KNOW.

113
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:17,576
THE POINT IS, NO MATTER HOW MUCH

114
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,567
THE THEORY EVOLVES, ONE THING'S

115
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:20,734
ALWAYS THE SAME:

116
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,400
THE BOTTOM LINE ABOUT THIS

117
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:23,400
CONSPIRACY THEORY IS THAT IT'S A

118
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:25,033
CONSPIRACY TO PROTECT TRUMP.

119
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,209
SO THINGS THAT, TO THE REST OF

120
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:27,633
US, MIGHT SEEM LIKE BAD NEWS FOR

121
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,600
TRUMP, LIKE THE MUELLER

122
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,900
INVESTIGATION, THEY LOOK AT AS

123
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:31,200
ACTUALLY PART OF TRUMP'S GRAND

124
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:33,233
STRATEGY.

125
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,376
YOU SEE, HE WAS COLLUDING WITH

126
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,767
RU... HE WANTED TO MAKE IT LOOK

127
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:36,467
LIKE HE WAS COLLUDING WITH

128
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:37,367
RUSSIA ON PURPOSE SO THAT ROBERT

129
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:38,476
MUELLER WOULD BE HIRED AND HE

130
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,834
COULD TEAM UP WITH TRUMP,

131
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,200
MUELLER AND TRUMP TEAMING UP

132
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:42,667
TOGETHER TO INVESTIGATE THE

133
00:03:42,734 --> 00:03:43,567
CLINTONS AND THE REST OF THE

134
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:45,400
DEEP STATE AND THEIR GLOBAL

135
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:49,734
PEDOPHILE SEX RING.

136
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,533
SO THAT IS... THAT TAKES

137
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
A LOT OF...

138
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:56,433
THINKING TO GET THAT FAR.

139
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,400
YEAH, IT DOES.

140
00:03:57,467 --> 00:03:58,567
AND MY FAVORITE PART OF

141
00:03:58,633 --> 00:03:59,200
THAT IS WATCHING JUDY WOODRUFF

142
00:03:59,266 --> 00:03:59,767
STRUGGLE TO FIND A WORD TO

143
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:00,400
DESCRIBE IT THAT SHE CAN SAY ON

144
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:00,800
PBS.

145
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:01,767
BECAUSE "THAT TAKES A LOT OF

146
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:03,000
THINKING" IS BASICALLY PUBLIC

147
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:03,667
TELEVISION FOR "THAT'S THE

148
00:04:03,734 --> 00:04:07,200
DUMBEST SHIT I'VE EVER HEARD."

149
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:08,200
NOW, TO GIVE YOU A TASTE OF HOW

150
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:09,667
INTRICATELY STUPID THIS IS, THIS

151
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:10,567
FLOW CHART PURPORTS TO EXPLAIN

152
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:12,133
HOW Q'S THEORIES RELATE TO

153
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,667
EVERYTHING ELSE, CONNECTING Q TO

154
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:15,333
EVERYTHING FROM HALLIBURTON TO

155
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,700
"JESUIT REVENGE" TO SIMPLY

156
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:18,934
"WIFI, 1998."

157
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,433
ALTHOUGH I DO THINK WE CAN ALL

158
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,300
AGREE THAT PRINCESS DIANA IS

159
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:23,567
INDEED THE CONNECTIVE TISSUE

160
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:24,767
BETWEEN JonBENET RAMSEY AND

161
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:27,100
LOCKHEED MARTIN.

162
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,834
AND THERE'S SO MUCH MORE, LIKE

163
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,100
THE QANON SLOGAN, "WHERE WE GO

164
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,600
ONE, WE GO ALL," HELPFULLY

165
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:34,000
ABBREVIATED AS WWG1WGA IN CASE

166
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,467
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE A

167
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:40,333
HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE MISTAKE.

168
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,700
ALSO THERE ARE QANON SONGS, AND

169
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:42,300
BRACE YOURSELF... EVERYTHING

170
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,300
YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE IS TOTAL

171
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:49,433
HORSESHIT.

172
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:06,066
BARS.

173
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:08,166
NOT QUITE AS CATCHY AS CARDI B'S

174
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:09,467
"MY HEAD GAME IS FIRE,

175
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:10,810
PUNANI DASANI, IT'S GOIN' IN DRY

176
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:11,700
AND IT'S COMIN' OUT SOGGY," BUT

177
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:13,433
BOTH "WAP" AND "THE QANON SONG"

178
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,100
LEAVE ME FEELING BOTH STUNNED

179
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:15,800
AND WONDERING, WHO THE FUCK IS

180
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:17,200
THAT WHITE LADY AND WHY IS SHE

181
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,600
THERE?

182
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:20,000
ALSO, TO THE COMMENTER WHO WROTE

183
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:22,133
ON THE QANON VIDEO, "WOW!

184
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,667
I DON'T CARE FOR HIP-HOP BUT I

185
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:26,367
LOVE THIS!"

186
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:27,900
I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS, IF YOU

187
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:29,367
LIKE THAT VIDEO, YOU STILL DON'T

188
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:29,734
LIKE HIP-HOP.

189
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,843
AND GREENE BOOSTING QANON SHOULD

190
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:31,500
BE DISQUALIFYING IN ITSELF...

191
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:33,533
CONSPIRACY THEORIES CAN BE

192
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,100
INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS.

193
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,066
BUT IT'S ALSO FAR FROM THE ONLY

194
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:36,293
ODIOUS THING SHE'S EVER SAID.

195
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,033
GREENE ALSO WON DESPITE A

196
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,633
HISTORY OF RACIST AND INCENDIARY

197
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,033
REMARKS AGAINST MUSLIMS.

198
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,066
WE HAVE AN ISLAMIC INVASION

199
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:50,000
INTO OUR GOVERNMENT OFFICES.

200
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:52,767
ABOUT DEMOCRATS.

201
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:53,767
THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP THE

202
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:54,533
BLACK PEOPLE IN A MODERN-DAY

203
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,033
FORUM OF SLAVERY.

204
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,967
IT'S A SLAVERY SYSTEM TO KEEP

205
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:56,834
THEIR VOTE.

206
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,910
ABOUT BLACKS AND CONFEDERATE

207
00:05:57,934 --> 00:05:58,300
STATUES.

208
00:05:58,367 --> 00:05:59,667
IF I WERE BLACK PEOPLE TODAY

209
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,066
AND I WALKED BY ONE OF THOSE

210
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:02,300
STATUES, I WOULD BE SO PROUD,

211
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:03,443
BECAUSE I'D SAY, "LOOK HOW FAR I

212
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:05,400
HAVE COME IN THIS COUNTRY."

213
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:09,867
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, IF

214
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:10,800
YOU WERE "BLACK PEOPLE TODAY"?

215
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:11,500
SO, NOT JUST ONE BLACK PERSON,

216
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:12,266
BUT "ALL" BLACK PEOPLE?

217
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,166
ALSO, WHY WOULD ANYONE NEED YOU

218
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:15,500
TO ENGAGE IN THIS HYPOTHETICAL?

219
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:16,767
YOU'RE NOT "BLACK PEOPLE"...

220
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:17,876
THOUGH I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED

221
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,109
TO FIND OUT YOU TEMPORARILY WERE

222
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:20,367
ON A HALLOWEEN OR TWO.

223
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:22,700
NOW, I SHOULD SAY THAT, BEFORE

224
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:23,533
GREENE'S ELECTION, TOP

225
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,333
REPUBLICANS TRIED TO DISTANCE

226
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,700
THEMSELVES FROM HER, WITH HOUSE

227
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:27,500
MINORITY LEADER KEVIN McCARTHY'S

228
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:28,710
SPOKESPERSON CALLING HER REMARKS

229
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:30,166
"APPALLING."

230
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:31,443
BUT SINCE HER VICTORY, THAT TONE

231
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:32,633
HAS SHIFTED.

232
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,633
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WAS

233
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,567
QUICK TO HERALD HER VICTORY,

234
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:37,133
SAYING IN A TWEET WEDNESDAY

235
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,467
MORNING THAT SHE'S A FUTURE

236
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:39,934
REPUBLICAN STAR AND A REAL

237
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,066
WINNER.

238
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:42,600
A COUPLE HOURS LATER, A

239
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:43,876
McCARTHY SPOKESPERSON SAID, "WE

240
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,076
LOOK FORWARD TO GREENE AND OTHER

241
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,467
REPUBLICANS WINNING IN

242
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:48,734
NOVEMBER."

243
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,943
OKAY, I GET THAT YOU

244
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:50,976
SHOULD BE WELCOMING TO YOUR NEW

245
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,667
COLLEAGUES.

246
00:06:51,734 --> 00:06:52,900
BUT MAYBE DON'T BE "THAT"

247
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:54,076
WELCOMING WHEN THEY'VE BASICALLY

248
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,176
ACCUSED YOUR OTHER CO-WORKERS OF

249
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,000
BEING SATANIC CHILD SEX RING

250
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:57,100
LEADERS.

251
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,367
SAVE THAT FOR HAPPY HOUR.

252
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:00,667
THAT'S GOOD GOSSIP.

253
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:01,934
BUT THIS SHOULD BE WORRYING.

254
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,166
IT'S BAD ENOUGH TO ENCOUNTER

255
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:06,900
THESE CONSPIRACY THEORIES

256
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:07,533
ONLINE; IT IS WORSE TO

257
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,500
POTENTIALLY BE ENCOUNTERING THEM

258
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:11,066
IN THE HALLS OF CONGRESS.

259
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:12,242
AND I WOULD LOVE TO BE SHOCKED

260
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:12,867
THAT REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IS

261
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:13,600
EMBRACING AN ONLINE TROLL WITH A

262
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:14,676
HISTORY OF RACIST COMMENTS, BUT

263
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,367
THE TRUTH IS, THEY'VE BEEN DOING

264
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:18,200
THAT FOR YEARS.

265
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:19,200
BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY SEE GREENE

266
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:21,300
AS A DISTURBING ANOMALY IF YOU

267
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:23,233
IGNORE THE BASIC FACT THAT, WHEN

268
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:24,333
IT COMES TO THE MODERN

269
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,609
REPUBLICAN PARTY, WHERE THEY GO

270
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:32,400
ONE, THEY GO ALL.

271
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:34,667
AND NOW,

272
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:36,600
LARRY KING, MASTER SALESMAN.

273
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:38,867
AS YOU KNOW, I WOULD RARELY

274
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:40,500
BECOME ASSOCIATED WITH ANY

275
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:42,467
PRODUCT, AS I HAVE BUILT A

276
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:43,900
LIFETIME CAREER AS BEING AN

277
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:44,867
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIVE

278
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:45,533
NEWS ANCHOR.

279
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,100
I HAVE NEVER IN 60 YEARS ON

280
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:49,900

281
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:50,300
REALLY?

282
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:52,934
I'VE NEVER PUT MY NAME ON A

283
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,266

284
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,333
OMEGA XL.

285
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,767
CALL AND GET MILLIONAIRE SUCCESS

286
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:02,000
HABITS.

287
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:04,500
WORKS FOR ME, IT WILL WORK FOR

288
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:04,667
YOU.

289
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,834
TWO OR THREE PAYMENTS.

290
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:13,667
HERE COMES LARRY.

291
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:16,300
I JUST SWALLOW THEM WITHOUT

292
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:16,500
WATER.

293
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:18,100
EVERYBODY SHOULD BE USING

294
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,367
BREATH GEMS.

295
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,567
MY ROMANTIC LIFE.

296
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:25,567
LET'S JUST SAY, THE KING IS BACK

297
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:25,767
BACK.

298
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:26,500
MOVING ON.

299
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:27,233
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

300
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:27,900
JURY DUTY, A SUMMONS FOR WHICH

301
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:29,009
IS ONE OF THE THINGS YOU LEAST

302
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:29,600
WANT TO FIND IN THE MAIL, ASIDE

303
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:30,166

304
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:31,000
TOE.

305
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:31,734
PLEASE... A PINKIE?

306
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,266
CALL ME WHEN YOU'RE SERIOUS

307
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:36,500
ENOUGH TO SEND A MIDDLE PIGGIE.

308
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:37,300
THEN MAYBE WE'LL TALK BUSINESS.

309
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:38,033
COMPLAINING ABOUT JURY DUTY HAS

310
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,000
LONG BEEN A BELOVED AMERICAN

311
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:39,767
PASTIME.

312
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:41,633
JUST WATCH THIS CALLER TO A

313
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,433
'90s LOCAL TV SHOW DELIGHT THE

314
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,800
HOST WITH HIS WHINING.

315
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:45,400
THEY PUT US DOWN IN THIS

316
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:47,834
HOLDING PEN, THEY CALL IT THE

317
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,467
JURY ASSEMBLY ROOM.

318
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:51,834
YEAH?

319
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,166

WHOLE WEEK.

323
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:56,867
OH, MAN.

324
00:08:56,934 --> 00:08:58,142
AND I FIGURE IT'S LIKE BEING

325
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:58,734
IN JAIL, ONLY JAIL'S A WHOLE LOT

326
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,967
BETTER, BECAUSE JAIL'S A LOT

327
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:00,900
CLEANER AND HAS MUCH BETTER

328
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:04,100
LIGHTING.

329
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:04,834
OH.

330
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,834
AND WE HAVE TO PAY FOR OUR

331
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,567
OWN FOOD, AND WE DON'T GET TO GO

332
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:07,843
OUTSIDE, WE DON'T GET FREE HBO,

333
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:09,009
WE DON'T GET TO TALK AS MUCH, WE

334
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:09,633
DON'T GET HEALTHCARE, AND WE

335
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,367
DON'T GET CONJUGAL VISITS.

336
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:11,300
YOU DON'T GET ANY OF THAT

337
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:11,934
STUFF?

338
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,200
WE DON'T GET ANY OF THAT.

339
00:09:16,266 --> 00:09:16,767
NOW, HE'S ACTUALLY

340
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:17,066
RIGHT.

341
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:17,867
YOU DON'T GET CONJUGAL VISITS

342
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:18,467
WHILE WAITING TO BE CALLED AT

343
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:19,266
JURY DUTY.

344
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,066
ALTHOUGH JUDGING FROM THAT CALL,

345
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:21,142
"BEING AT JURY DUTY" ISN'T THAT

346
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,176
CALLER'S PRIMARY OBSTACLE IN

347
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,033
THAT DEPARTMENT.

348
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,033
AS FOR NOT GETTING HBO, I DON'T

349
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,533
KNOW WHAT HE'S COMPLAINING

350
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,000
ABOUT THERE.

351
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:28,900
THEY DON'T EVEN GIVE ME FREE HBO

352
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:30,100
AND I'M ACTIVELY RUINING IT.

353
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,333
NOW, THAT MAN, GREG, WAS A

354
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,000
REGULAR CALLER TO THAT SHOW.

355
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:34,266
AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE GOT

356
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,166
CURIOUS ABOUT HIM AFTER WATCHING

357
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:37,000
THAT CLIP, AND IT TURNS OUT,

358
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:38,066
HE'S A LOT.

359
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,633
FOR EXAMPLE, GREG HAS A WEBSITE

360
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,800
WHERE YOU CAN FIND CLASSIC

361
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:42,200
"GREGISMS" LIKE

362
00:09:42,266 --> 00:09:44,000
"ENVIRONMENTALISM IS EVIL," OR

363
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:45,343
"THE BAPTISTS ARE THE PIN IN THE

364
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:46,266
HOMO GRENADE."

365
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,567
INCIDENTALLY, "GREGISMS" ISN'T A

366
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:50,867
EVEN TERM I MADE UP, IT'S AN

367
00:09:50,934 --> 00:09:53,266
ACTUAL SECTION OF HIS WEBSITE.

368
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,667
WE COULD HONESTLY SPEND THE REST

369
00:09:55,734 --> 00:09:57,066
OF THIS SHOW ON GREG, BUT SADLY,

370
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:57,500
WE HAVE TO MOVE ON.

371
00:09:57,567 --> 00:09:58,066
BECAUSE THE IMPORTANT THING

372
00:09:58,133 --> 00:09:58,800
ABOUT JURY DUTY IS... YOU KNOW

373
00:09:58,867 --> 00:09:59,734
WHAT?

374
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,266
JUST ONE MORE THING ABOUT GREG.

375
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,000
HE'S BEEN TWEETING "IT'S ALMOST

376
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:02,867
TIME TO HAVE A GREAT #Weekend

377
00:10:02,934 --> 00:10:03,834
EVERYONE!

378
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,633
WHO'S WITH ME?" EVERY FRIDAY FOR

379
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,200
THE LAST VERY MANY FRIDAYS, AND

380
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:17,266
READ THE ROOM, GREG.

381
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,440
NO ONE HAS GREAT #Weekends

382
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:20,200
ANYMORE.

383
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:20,834
WE'RE ALL SITTING AT HOME

384
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,567
WATCHING THE DAYS BLUR TOGETHER

385
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:22,400
IN A MISERABLE #TimeSoup.

386
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:23,066
BUT WHILE IT MIGHT SOUND CLICHE,

387
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:23,800
SERVING ON A JURY REALLY IS AN

388
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:24,500
ESSENTIAL CIVIC DUTY.

389
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:25,300
THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY AN

390
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:26,300
IMPARTIAL JURY OF YOUR PEERS IS

391
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:27,300
ENSHRINED IN THE SIXTH AMENDMENT

392
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:29,033
OF THE CONSTITUTION.

393
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:30,000
BUT THE TRUTH IS, WHILE

394
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:30,967
"YOUR PEERS" ARE SUPPOSED BE

395
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:33,233
CHOSEN FROM A FAIR CROSS-SECTION

396
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,967
OF SOCIETY, PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE

397
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:36,967
ROUTINELY EXCLUDED.

398
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:38,100
ACCORDING TO A STUDY OF

399
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,834
14 FEDERAL DISTRICT COURTS,

400
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,333
UNDERREPRESENTATION OF THE

401
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,200
LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN

402
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:45,066
POPULATIONS IS "UBIQUITOUS,"

403
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:46,209
WHICH IS A PROBLEM WITH HUGE

404
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:47,500
IMPLICATIONS FOR JURIES.

405
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:49,033
THIS SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGIST STAGED

406
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,266
MOCK CASES WHERE SOME JURIES

407
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,667
WERE ALL WHITE AND OTHERS WERE

408
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,300
RACIALLY DIVERSE AND FOUND THE

409
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:56,166
DIVERSE ONES OPERATED MORE

410
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:57,834
FAIRLY AND DELIBERATED MORE

411
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,200
COMPREHENSIVELY.

412
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:01,600
IN THIS STUDY, THEY... THEY

413
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,033
RAISED MORE FACTS FROM THE

414
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,033
TRIAL, THEY DISCUSS A BROADER

415
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,433
RANGE OF INFORMATION, THEY

416
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,967
DISCUSS THE INFORMATION MORE

417
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:07,967
ACCURATELY, ACTUALLY, IN

418
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:08,667
DISCUSSING THE FACTS OF THE

419
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:09,734
CASE.

420
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:11,767
THEY'RE MORE WILLING TO HAVE

421
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:13,633
UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATIONS

422
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,967
ABOUT CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES LIKE

423
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:16,273
THOSE INVOLVING RACE AND RACIAL

424
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,033
PROFILING.

425
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,200
YEAH, IT TURNS OUT

426
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:20,467
JURIES ARE SORT OF LIKE

427
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:21,300
PRESIDENTS OF THE SPOKANE,

428
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:22,233
WASHINGTON, CHAPTER OF THE

429
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,633
NAACP.

430
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,333
WHEN THEY'RE ENTIRELY WHITE,

431
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,567
THINGS TEND TO GO SOUTH FAST.

432
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,720
AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE

433
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:29,800
REAL WORLD.

434
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:31,076
RESEARCHERS WHO EXAMINED FELONY

435
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,500
TRIALS IN FLORIDA FOUND THAT

436
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,467
JURIES FORMED FROM ALL-WHITE

437
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:35,900
POOLS CONVICT BLACK DEFENDANTS A

438
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:37,500
FULL 16 PERCENTAGE POINTS MORE

439
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:38,400
OFTEN THAN THEY DO WHITE

440
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:40,166
DEFENDANTS.

441
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,600
BUT THAT GAP IN CONVICTION RATES

442
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,333
IS ENTIRELY ELIMINATED WHEN THE

443
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,000
POOL INCLUDES AT LEAST ONE BLACK

444
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:46,700
MEMBER.

445
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:48,066
AND THAT'S ONE OF THOSE FACTS

446
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,209
THAT YOU PROBABLY ASSUMED WAS

447
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:50,100
TRUE, EVEN THOUGH YOU WISH IT

448
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,300
WASN'T.

449
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:52,934
LIKE THE FACT THAT DOGS DON'T

450
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,040
REALLY ENJOY MUSIC OR THAT

451
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:55,266
SEAN PENN'S NEW WIFE IS A YEAR

452
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,266
YOUNGER THAN HIS DAUGHTER.

453
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,066
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT

454
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:00,700
WHY JURIES ARE SO OFTEN

455
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,009
UNREPRESENTATIVE AND WHAT WE CAN

456
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:03,333
DO ABOUT IT.

457
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,409
AND THE WHOLE PROCESS STARTS

458
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,633
WITH WHAT'S CALLED A

459
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,200
"JURY WHEEL"... A POOL OF

460
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:08,834
POTENTIAL JURORS IN A COMMUNITY.

461
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,633
IT USED TO BE AN ACTUAL WHEEL,

462
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,980
AND FOR MANY YEARS, BLACK PEOPLE

463
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:13,333
WERE EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FROM

464
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,500
THEM.

465
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,467
AND EVEN AFTER THE CIVIL RIGHTS

466
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:16,934
ACT OF 1875 SAID YOU COULDN'T

467
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,567
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST JURORS

468
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:20,800
BASED ON RACE, MANY OFFICIALS

469
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:22,700
WOULD STILL FIND WAYS TO REMOVE

470
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:24,400
THEM, LIKE BY PRINTING THEIR

471
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:25,734
NAMES ON DIFFERENT COLOR PAPER

472
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,200
SO THEY COULD BE AVOIDED DURING

473
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:28,767
THE SUPPOSEDLY RANDOM DRAWINGS.

474
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:30,000
AND WHILE THANKFULLY THAT

475
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:31,500
DOESN'T HAPPEN ANYMORE, OUR

476
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:32,710
CURRENT SYSTEM HAS MANY FLAWS

477
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:33,743
THAT CAN END UP HAVING A SIMILAR

478
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:34,600
RESULT.

479
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:35,667
FOR INSTANCE, NOWADAYS,

480
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,000
JURY WHEELS ARE OFTEN

481
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:38,076
COMPUTERIZED LISTS GATHERED FROM

482
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,000
VOTER REGISTRATION AND DRIVER'S

483
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:40,567
LICENSE RECORDS.

484
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:41,967
BUT THERE'S A BIG PROBLEM THERE,

485
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:43,166
AS THIS PUBLIC DEFENDER IN

486
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:45,100
NEW ORLEANS EXPLAINS:

487
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,409
NOT EVERYBODY'S REGISTERED TO

488
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,133
VOTE AND NOT EVERYBODY OWNS A

489
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
CAR AND, YOU KNOW, HAS A

490
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:50,734
DRIVER'S LICENSE.

491
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,233
THE PROBLEM IS WHEN WE USE VOTER

492
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,633
REGISTRATION OR DMV RECORDS,

493
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,700
WE'RE... WE'RE PROBABLY

494
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:56,767
EXCLUDING AROUND 35% OF

495
00:12:56,834 --> 00:12:57,667
NEW ORLEANIANS.

496
00:12:57,734 --> 00:12:59,133
RIGHT.

497
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,900
35% OF PEOPLE ARE EXCLUDED

498
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:01,567
THERE.

499
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:02,643
AND BEING REGISTERED TO VOTE AND

500
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:03,743
OWNING A CAR DOESN'T AFFECT

501
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:04,667
WHETHER YOU'RE QUALIFIED TO

502
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:06,066
SERVE ON A JURY.

503
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:07,066
IT JUST AFFECTS HOW MUCH MONEY

504
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:08,209
YOU PROBABLY SPEND ON BUMPER

505
00:13:08,233 --> 00:13:09,266
STICKERS.

506
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,600
THINK OF THEM

507
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:14,200
AS TRAFFIC TWITTER.

508
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:15,266
THAT'S NOT A COMPLIMENT.

509
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,233
AND THE EXCLUSIONS DON'T STOP

510
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,467
THERE.

511
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:18,667
MOST STATES BAN PEOPLE WITH

512
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:20,033
FELONY CONVICTIONS, AND WITH

513
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,340
JUROR PAY BEING INCREDIBLY LOW,

514
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,633
LOWER-INCOME PEOPLE CAN BE

515
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,000
UNABLE TO AFFORD TO TAKE PART,

516
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:25,533
BOTH OF WHICH DISPROPORTIONATELY

517
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,667
EXCLUDE PEOPLE OF COLOR.

518
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:29,533
SO INHERENTLY, THE SYSTEM IS

519
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,433
ALREADY BIASED.

520
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,600
AND THAT'S BEFORE YOU EVEN GET

521
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:34,600
INTO THE MISTAKES JURY SUMMONING

522
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:36,900
SYSTEMS CAN MAKE... WHICH, TO BE

523
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:37,700
FAIR, CAN SOMETIMES BE PRETTY

524
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:38,934
FUN.

525
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,533
I GOT JERRY DUTY.

526
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,667
I SAID, "WHAT'S JERRY DUTY?"

527
00:13:43,734 --> 00:13:45,166
SUMMONED FOR JERRY... JURY

528
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:46,500
SERVICE.

529
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:48,533
IF YOU'RE PICKED, THEN YOU GO UP

530
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,266
TO THE JUDGE AND THEN YOU SAY IF

531
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,900
THEY'RE GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY.

532
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:55,367
YEAH!

533
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:55,934
JACOB GOT JERRY DUTY.

534
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,834
AND WHILE I CAN'T BELIEVE HE

535
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,734
FOUND CASEY ANTHONY NOT GUILTY,

536
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,700
THAT'S WHAT HE AND HIS JERRY

537
00:13:58,767 --> 00:13:59,600
DECIDED, AND WE JUST NEED TO

538
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:01,367
LIVE WITH THAT.

539
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:02,467
BUT SOME ERRORS ARE

540
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:03,967
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FUN.

541
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:05,313
FOR INSTANCE, IN CONNECTICUT, IT

542
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:06,734
EMERGED THAT THEIR JURY

543
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,000
SELECTION COMPUTER PROGRAM HAD

544
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:09,800
ACCIDENTALLY READ THE "D" IN

545
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:10,943
"HARTFORD" TO MEAN "DECEASED."

546
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:12,500
SO FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS, IT

547
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:13,700
NEVER SUMMONED ANYONE FROM

548
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:15,133
HARTFORD... OR, INDEED,

549
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,734
NEW BRITAIN, THE SECOND-LARGEST

550
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,967
CITY IN THAT DISTRICT, BECAUSE

551
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:20,900
THEIR LIST OF NAMES HAD BEEN

552
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:21,867
ACCIDENTALLY MISPLACED AND WAS

553
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:22,834
NEVER ENTERED INTO THE PROGRAM.

554
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,100
AND THE THING IS, THOSE TWO

555
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,734
MISSING CITIES ACCOUNTED FOR

556
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,467
63% OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THE

557
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,000
DISTRICT AND 68% OF THE HISPANIC

558
00:14:30,066 --> 00:14:31,667
POPULATION.

559
00:14:31,734 --> 00:14:33,834
WHICH IS HORRIBLE.

560
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,940
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO

561
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,200
FORGET A TOWN IN CONNECTICUT,

562
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:37,033
WHY NOT FORGET DANBURY?

563
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,667
BECAUSE... AND THIS IS TRUE...

564
00:14:37,734 --> 00:14:38,867
FUCK DANBURY!

565
00:14:38,934 --> 00:14:40,300
FROM ITS CHARMING RAILWAY MUSEUM

566
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:41,767
TO ITS HISTORIC HEARTHSTONE

567
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:43,433
CASTLE, DANBURY, CONNECTICUT,

568
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,033
CAN EAT MY WHOLE ASS.

569
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,900
I KNOW THREE THINGS ABOUT

570
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:49,433
"USA TODAY" RANKED IT

571
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,834
THE SECOND-BEST CITY TO LIVE IN

572
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,500
IN 2015, IT WAS ONCE THE CENTER

573
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:53,834
OF THE AMERICAN HAT INDUSTRY,

574
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,300
AND IF YOU'RE FROM THERE, YOU'VE

575
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:56,633
GOT A STANDING INVITE TO COME

576
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,433
GET A THRASHING FROM

577
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,367
JOHN OLIVER.

578
00:14:58,433 --> 00:14:59,367
CHILDREN INCLUDED.

579
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:02,300
FUCK YOU.

580
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:03,443
NOW, THAT HARTFORD ERROR WAS

581
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:04,166
MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN

582
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:05,400
SYSTEM.

583
00:15:05,467 --> 00:15:06,467
BUT MANY COURTS ACTUALLY

584
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:07,400
CONTRACT OUT THEIR JURY

585
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:08,600
SELECTION TO COMPANIES LIKE

586
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:09,710
THESE, WHO PROMISE TO RUN THE

587
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:10,734
PROCESS CHEAPER AND MORE

588
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,066
EFFICIENTLY.

589
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:13,242
BUT PRIVATE COMPANIES CAN BE

590
00:15:13,266 --> 00:15:15,000
SURPRISINGLY UNRELIABLE.

591
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:16,500
TAKE WHAT HAPPENED OUTSIDE

592
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:17,467
TULSA, OKLAHOMA, WHERE A BLACK

593
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:19,233
MAN WAS TRIED BY AN ALL-WHITE

594
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,100
JURY, DRAWN FROM A POOL OF 200

595
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,233
JURORS WITHOUT A SINGLE BLACK

596
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,767
PERSON IN IT, AFTER THE COMPANY

597
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:26,633
HANDLING JURY SELECTION

598
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,066
ACCIDENTALLY EXCLUDED ZIP CODES

599
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:29,734
WHERE 90% OF ITS BLACK RESIDENTS

600
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,667
LIVED.

601
00:15:31,734 --> 00:15:33,133
THEN THERE'S ALLEN COUNTY,

602
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,467
INDIANA, WHERE THIS COMPANY HAD

603
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:35,834
A SYSTEM THAT WAS PROGRAMMED TO

604
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,066
WORK THROUGH AN ALPHABETICAL

605
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:38,900
LIST OF TOWNSHIPS AND STOP WHEN

606
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:40,767
IT REACHED 10,000 NAMES.

607
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:41,943
UNFORTUNATELY, IT TURNED OUT 75%

608
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:43,967
OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THAT

609
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:45,900
COUNTY HAPPENED TO LIVE IN

610
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:47,800
WAYNE TOWNSHIP, TOWARDS THE END

611
00:15:47,867 --> 00:15:49,834
OF THE ALPHABET, MEANING THEY

612
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,200
HAD ROUGHLY HALF THE CHANCE OF

613
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:52,767
BEING INCLUDED ON A JURY THAN A

614
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:53,843
TRULY RANDOM SYSTEM WOULD HAVE

615
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:55,333
PRODUCED.

616
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,433
SO YET AGAIN, ALPHABETIZATION

617
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,800
FAILS US.

618
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:00,567
IT'S

619
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:02,066
AN ABC-SUPREMACIST SYSTEM THAT

620
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:03,400
DISRESPECTS THE BETTER END OF

621
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:04,767
THE ALPHABET.

622
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:10,133
BECAUSE THINK ABOUT IT...

623
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,300
Z HAS GOT ALL THE HOTTIES!

624
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:12,900
ZAYN.

625
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:13,600
ZOE.

626
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:14,300
ZENDAYA.

627
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:14,934
ZAC EFRON.

628
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,767
AND OF COURSE, ZONKEYS...

629
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:16,834
HALF ZEBRA, HALF DONKEY,

630
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,367
ALL SEX.

631
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:20,333
NOW, THE EXTENT OF THAT INDIANA

632
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,543
ERROR ONLY EMERGED WHEN A MAN

633
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:22,643
WHO'D BEEN CONVICTED THERE SUED

634
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:23,907
OVER THE MAKEUP OF HIS JURY AND

635
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:24,767
HIS LAWYER POINTED OUT TO THE

636
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:27,000
STATE SUPREME COURT JUST HOW LAX

637
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:29,967
THE DESIGN PROCESS HAD BEEN:

638
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:32,266
IT'S NOT A GLITCH, NOT A

639
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,100
GLITCH OR COMPUTER BUG, IT'S

640
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,734
PROGRAMMING DETERMINATION.

641
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,633
THESE ARE CODES.

642
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,600
THESE ARE DETERMINATIONS THAT

643
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:39,400
THE PROGRAMMER PUT INTO THE

644
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,066
PROGRAM.

645
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:44,934
IT DIDN'T... SOME VIRUS COME IN

646
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,767
AND MAKE THE PROGRAM GO BAD.

647
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:46,976
IT WAS BAD BECAUSE HE MADE THESE

648
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,042
DECISIONS, AND EASILY THEY COULD

649
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:49,176
HAVE BEEN PROGRAMMED ANOTHER

650
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,300
WAY.

651
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:51,300
THIS WAS A PART-TIME COLLEGE

652
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:54,900
STUDENT.

653
00:16:54,967 --> 00:16:55,667
THAT'S TRUE.

654
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:56,900
THAT COUNTY'S JURY SYSTEM WAS

655
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:58,400
ORIGINALLY DESIGNED BY A COLLEGE

656
00:16:58,467 --> 00:16:58,967
STUDENT WHOSE PREVIOUS JOB,

657
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:00,176
INCIDENTALLY, HAD BEEN WORKING

658
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,700
AT A HEAD SHOP.

659
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:03,100
AND LOOK, THERE ARE PLENTY OF

660
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,367
JOBS THAT PEOPLE WITH HEAD SHOP

661
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:06,133
EXPERIENCE ARE QUALIFIED TO DO.

662
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,867
FOR INSTANCE, CLEANING BONG

663
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:08,042
RESIN OFF AN IKEA COUCH CUSHION

664
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:09,800
OR GOING ON A LATE-NIGHT SNACK

665
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:11,042
RUN TO 7-11 AND ONLY GETTING 40%

666
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:13,266
OF WHAT EVERYONE ASKED FOR.

667
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,166
I'M JUST NOT SURE "PROGRAMMING A

668
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:16,376
COUNTY'S OFFICIAL JURY LIST" IS

669
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,834
ONE OF THOSE JOBS.

670
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,140
AND WHETHER THE ERRORS IN THESE

671
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,100
PROGRAMS WERE DELIBERATE OR JUST

672
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,400
CARELESS, THE RESULT IS THE

673
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:23,867
SAME.

674
00:17:23,934 --> 00:17:25,133
AND I'D LOVE TO TELL YOU

675
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,667
MISTAKES LIKE THESE ARE RARE.

676
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:30,133
BUT THE TRUTH IS, NO ONE KNOWS

677
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,033
HOW COMMON THEY ARE.

678
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,100
WE ONLY KNOW ABOUT THE EXAMPLES

679
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,406
THAT I MENTIONED SO FAR BECAUSE

680
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:36,934
OF LAWSUITS THAT TOOK YEARS.

681
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,600
PRIVATE VENDORS OFTEN WON'T

682
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:38,266
REVEAL DETAILS ABOUT THEIR

683
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:38,967
SYSTEMS, CLAIMING ALGORITHMS ARE

684
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:40,200
A TRADE SECRET.

685
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:41,443
AND 39 OUT OF 50 STATES PROVIDE

686
00:17:41,467 --> 00:17:42,800
NO PUBLIC ACCESS TO JURY POOL

687
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:45,767
DATA.

688
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:47,074
SO YOUR COURT SYSTEM MIGHT HAVE

689
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:48,767
A MASSIVE PROBLEM, AND UNTIL A

690
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,266
NINE-YEAR-OLD SHOWS UP FOR A

691
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,443
MURDER TRIAL, NO ONE WOULD HAVE

692
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:54,433
ANY IDEA.

693
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,166
AND ALL THIS IS BEFORE JURORS

694
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:57,276
EVEN SHOW UP FOR SELECTION, AT

695
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,333
WHICH POINT, THINGS GET EVEN

696
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,166
WORSE, BECAUSE PROSECUTORS TEND

697
00:18:01,233 --> 00:18:03,000
TO EXCLUDE BLACK JURORS,

698
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:05,000
SOMETIMES OUT OF IMPLICIT BIAS,

699
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:06,800
BUT SOMETIMES OUT OF BIAS THAT

700
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:08,700
IS PRETTY FUCKING EXPLICIT.

701
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,166
JUST WATCH THIS PHILADELPHIA

702
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:12,433
D.A. ADDRESSING A ROOMFUL OF

703
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,543
PROSECUTORS IN A LEAKED 1980s

704
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:14,576
TRAINING VIDEO, EXPLAINING WHICH

705
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,367
JURORS THEY MIGHT WANT TO AVOID.

706
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:22,133
ANOTHER FACTOR, I'LL TELL YOU

707
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,133
ANOTHER FACTOR, I'LL TELL

708
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,834
YOU, IF, YOU KNOW, IN SELECTING

709
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,433
BLACKS, AGAIN, YOU DON'T WANT

710
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:26,934
THE REAL EDUCATED ONES.

711
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,176
AGAIN IT'S... THIS GOES ACROSS

712
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,400
THE BOARD OF ALL RACES.

713
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:32,266
YOU DON'T WANT SMART PEOPLE.

714
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,500
AND AGAIN... BUT IF YOU... IF

715
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:35,727
YOU... IF YOU'RE SITTING DOWN

716
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:37,467
AND YOU'RE GONNA TAKE BLACKS,

717
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:37,967
YOU WANT OLDER BLACKS.

718
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:38,734
IN MY EXPERIENCE, BLACK WOMEN,

719
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,500
YOUNG BLACK WOMEN ARE VERY BAD.

720
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:40,400
THERE'S AN ANTAGONISM.

721
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:41,233
I GUESS MAYBE BECAUSE THEY'RE

722
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,420
DOWNTRODDEN ON TWO RESPECTS.

723
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:43,600
THEY GOT TWO MINORITIES...

724
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:45,433
THEY'RE WOMEN AND THEY'RE BLACKS

725
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,033
AND SO THEY'RE DOWNTRODDEN ON

726
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:47,633
TWO AREAS AND THEY SOMEHOW WANT

727
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,033
TO TAKE IT OUT ON SOMEBODY, AND

728
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,667
YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE YOU.

729
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:53,600
OKAY, FIRST, ANY WHITE

730
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:55,767
PEOPLE WHO USE THE WORD "BLACK"

731
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,200
AS A NOUN AND NOT AN ADJECTIVE

732
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:58,567
ARE PRETTY SUSPICIOUS.

733
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:01,433
THROW IN THAT MUSTACHE AND

734
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,567
SUDDENLY IT FEELS LIKE

735
00:19:02,633 --> 00:19:03,266
A SPIKE LEE PERIOD PIECE.

736
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,066
AND EVEN PUTTING ASIDE THE

737
00:19:04,133 --> 00:19:05,253
BIGOTRY THERE, THE ONLY TIME

738
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,543
IT'S ACCEPTABLE TO SAY "WE DON'T

739
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:07,633
WANT SMART PEOPLE" IS IN A

740
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,743
TRAINING MANUAL FOR SELLING

741
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:10,333
LULAROE.

742
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,734
BECAUSE IF YOUR BUSINESS MODEL

743
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,943
IS "SELL 5,000 UGLY LEGGINGS ON

744
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:14,600
FACEBOOK TO THE PEOPLE WHO HATED

745
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:15,810
YOU IN HIGH SCHOOL," THEN, YEAH,

746
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:17,100
YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO WEED OUT

747
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,900
THE SMART PEOPLE.

748
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:20,467
NOW WE REACHED OUT TO THAT

749
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:21,767
PROSECUTOR, WHO WAS UPSET,

750
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:23,934
SAYING, "EVERYONE HAS TRIED TO

751
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,767
SOMEHOW MAKE THIS RACIST," EVEN

752
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:28,200
THOUGH HE AGREED THAT "THE BEST

753
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:29,266
JURY IS BIRACIAL."

754
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,767
SOMETHING SLIGHTLY UNDERCUT BY

755
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:32,767
THE FACT THAT, A, YOU JUST HEARD

756
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:34,009
HIM SAY "YOUNG BLACK WOMEN ARE

757
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:38,500
VERY BAD," AND B, A LATER REVIEW

758
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:39,900
OF FELONY CASES THAT HE'D TRIED

759
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:41,300
FOUND HE'D REMOVED BLACK JURORS

760
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,166
AT SUCH A HIGH RATE, THE ODDS OF

761
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:44,600
IT HAPPENING BY CHANCE WERE ONE

762
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:45,333
IN A QUADRILLION.

763
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,543
AND THAT GUY'S NOT A ONE-OFF.

764
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:47,400
RECENT STUDIES IN NORTH CAROLINA

765
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:49,367
AND LOUISIANA FOUND PROSECUTORS

766
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:50,900
STRIKING BLACK JURORS AT TWICE

767
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:52,233
AND THREE TIMES THE RATE OF

768
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,934
WHITE JURORS.

769
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,533
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING HOW THEY

770
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,843
WERE ABLE TO DO THAT, IT'S WORTH

771
00:19:58,867 --> 00:19:59,433
KNOWING, IN A TRIAL, LAWYERS

772
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,033
HAVE TWO WAYS TO REMOVE JURORS.

773
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,934
THE FIRST IS A SO-CALLED

774
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,800
CHALLENGE FOR CAUSE.

775
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:05,633
THAT'S WHERE THEY CAN SHOW A

776
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,810
JUROR CAN'T BE IMPARTIAL BECAUSE

777
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:08,767
OF SOME CONNECTION TO THE TRIAL

778
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:09,943
OR BECAUSE THEY'RE SOMEHOW UNFIT

779
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:12,467
TO SERVE.

780
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:13,300
THE SECOND IS A PEREMPTORY

781
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:15,333
CHALLENGE, WHERE THEY CAN REMOVE

782
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,066
A LIMITED NUMBER OF JURORS WITH

783
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,700
NO EXPLANATION, ALTHOUGH SINCE A

784
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:19,876
1986 SUPREME COURT RULING, THEY

785
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,467
CAN'T EXCLUDE JURORS PURELY

786
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:25,367
BASED ON RACE.

787
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,200
IT'S SOMETHING THAT THIS HLN

788
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:28,133
HOST EXPLAINS IN A BORDERLINE

789
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,667
AGGRESSIVELY LITERAL WAY:

790
00:20:28,734 --> 00:20:29,734
WHAT HAPPENS IS, THE

791
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:32,000
PROSECUTION AND DEFENSE EACH

792
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:34,834
HAVE TEN JURORS EACH THAT THEY

793
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,900
CAN REJECT FOR ANY REASON AT ALL

794
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:39,700
OR FOR NO REASON, UNLESS THEY

795
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:42,266
BELIEVE THE OTHER SIDE IS

796
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,633
PLAYING THE RACE CARD.

797
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,433
AND THEY CAN THEN CHALLENGE THAT

798
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,400
PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE.

799
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:54,166
I'VE GOT A LOT OF

800
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:54,800
QUESTIONS, AND NONE OF THEM ARE

801
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:55,533
ABOUT PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES.

802
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,643
FIRST, WHY USE THE LOADED TERM

803
00:20:56,667 --> 00:21:00,133
"PLAYING THE RACE CARD" AT ALL?

804
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:00,734
SECOND, WHY IMPLY IT MEANS

805
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,100
"ACTING IN A RACIST FASHION"

806
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:02,834
WHEN IT DOESN'T?

807
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,700
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOW LONG

808
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:05,000
DID THAT MAN WALK AROUND WITH

809
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:05,800
THAT "RACE CARD" IN HIS SUIT

810
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:07,066
POCKET?

811
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:08,867
WAS IT JUST FOR THE SHOW, OR

812
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:09,700
DOES HE ALWAYS WALK AROUND WITH

813
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:10,633
IT ON THE OFF-CHANCE HE HAS TO

814
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,266
EXPLAIN PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES TO

815
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,200
SOMEONE?

816
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:13,200
IF SO, DOES HE EVER GO TO PAY

817
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:14,476
FOR SOMETHING, ACCIDENTALLY PULL

818
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,433
OUT HIS RACE CARD, AND THEN SAY,

819
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,576
"OOPS, THAT'S NOT MY WALLET,

820
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,133
THAT'S MY RACE CARD" TO THE

821
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
UTTER BEWILDERMENT OF THE

822
00:21:20,266 --> 00:21:22,600
CASHIER?

823
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:23,710
ALSO, HOW DID HE GET THAT CARD?

824
00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:26,300
DID HE MAKE IT HIMSELF?

825
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:27,543
'CAUSE THAT'D BE WEIRD, BUT IT

826
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:28,867
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE WEIRDER IF

827
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:30,009
HE'D ASKED SOMEONE ELSE TO MAKE

828
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:30,266
IT FOR HIM.

829
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:30,834
THAT WOULD MEAN HE'D ASKED A

830
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,600
PRODUCER, "HEY, CAN YOU MAKE ME

831
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:32,433
A RACE CARD FOR MY SEGMENT ON

832
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,166
JURY SELECTION?"

833
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:33,867
TO WHICH THEY PROBABLY SAID,

834
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:34,400
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"

835
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:35,333
AND HE SAID, "YOU KNOW, LIKE A

836
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,000
PHYSICAL CARD THAT SAYS 'RACE

837
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:36,600
CARD' ON IT."

838
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:37,710
AND THEN THE PRODUCER SAID,

839
00:21:37,734 --> 00:21:38,400
"WHY?"

840
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:39,867
AND HE SAID, "BECAUSE I'M TRYING

841
00:21:39,934 --> 00:21:41,134
TO EXPLAIN LAWYERS PLAYING THE

842
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:41,934
RACE CARD WHEN STRIKING JURORS."

843
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,233
TO WHICH THE PRODUCER SAID,

844
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,000
"BUT CAN'T YOU JUST SAY THE

845
00:21:47,066 --> 00:21:47,700
PHRASE 'PLAYING THE RACE CARD?

846
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:48,567
OR, Y'KNOW, NOT ACTUALLY SAY IT

847
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:50,066
AT ALL?'"

848
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:50,667
AND HE SAID, "ABSOLUTELY NOT."

849
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:51,633
SO A PRODUCTION ASSISTANT THEN

850
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,000
SPENT 20 MINUTES PRINTING THE

851
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:54,142
WORDS "RACE CARD" ON A RED CARD.

852
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,100
IS THAT HOW IT CAME TO EXIST?

853
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,066
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO IT AFTER

854
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:57,867
THE SHOW?

855
00:21:57,934 --> 00:21:59,200
DID HE THROW IT AWAY?

856
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:00,467
OR DID HE PUT IT ON HIS DESK

857
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:01,367
JUST IN CASE HE EVER NEEDED IT

858
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:02,900
AGAIN?

859
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:04,042
AND IF SO, DID SOMEONE EVER WALK

860
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:04,900
BY AND SAY, "HEY, WHAT THE FUCK

861
00:22:04,967 --> 00:22:05,567
IS THAT?"

862
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:06,643
TO WHICH HE REPLIED, "OH, THAT'S

863
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:07,467
JUST MY RACE CARD" AS IF THAT'S

864
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:08,367
A NORMAL THING TO SAY OR TO

865
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:13,166
HAVE?

866
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:17,433
AND FINALLY, AND I KNOW THIS

867
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,133
ISN'T THE MOST IMPORTANT

868
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,800
THING... WHY DOES IT

869
00:22:21,867 --> 00:22:22,400
SAY RACE "CARD" ON IT?

870
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:22,967
IT'S ALREADY A CARD.

871
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:23,567
SHOULDN'T IT JUST SAY "RACE?"

872
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,133
BECAUSE ISN'T THE THING HE'S

873
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,734
HOLDING UP THERE TECHNICALLY A

874
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,400
"RACE CARD" CARD?

875
00:22:25,467 --> 00:22:26,233
AND IF SO, WHAT DOES THE FUCK

876
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:26,700
DOES "THAT" MEAN?

877
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:27,333
I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT

878
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,000
THIS, AND I KNOW WE DON'T HAVE

879
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:28,567
TIME, BUT I GUESS MY BROADER

880
00:22:28,633 --> 00:22:29,333
POINT IS, THERE ARE TWO WAYS FOR

881
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:29,934
LAWYERS TO STRIKE JURORS, AND

882
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,667
HLN IS A DEEPLY WEIRD TELEVISION

883
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:31,533
NETWORK.

884
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,700
BUT WHILE THE SUPREME COURT SAID

885
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:34,876
YOU CAN'T STRIKE JURORS BASED ON

886
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,600
RACE, IT TURNS OUT, THAT'S AN

887
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:39,300
EASY RULE TO GET AROUND.

888
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:42,033
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS COME UP

889
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,242
WITH SOME REASON OTHER THAN RACE

890
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:44,409
TO STRIKE A JUROR AND THEN DO IT

891
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:45,433
ANYWAY.

892
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:46,576
REMEMBER THAT LAWYER YOU SAW

893
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,133
EARLIER?

894
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,500
HE WAS SPEAKING AFTER THAT

895
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:50,643
RULING WAS HANDED DOWN AND WAS

896
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:51,967
OPENLY INSTRUCTING PROSECUTORS

897
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:54,333
ON HOW NOT TO GET CAUGHT.

898
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,000
LET'S SAY YOU STRIKE THREE

899
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:58,734
BLACKS TO START WITH.

900
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,900
FIRST THREE PEOPLE.

901
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:01,333
AND THEN IT'S LIKE, THE DEFENSE

902
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,500
ATTORNEY MAKES AN OBJECTION

903
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:03,647
SAYING THAT YOU'RE STRIKING

904
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:03,867
BLACKS.

905
00:23:03,934 --> 00:23:04,467
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE

906
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:08,300
TO GO BACK AND SAY, "OH, YEAH."

907
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:08,934
MAKE SOMETHING UP ABOUT WHY HE

908
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,333
DID IT.

909
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:09,967
WRITE IT DOWN RIGHT THEN AND

910
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:10,533
THERE.

911
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,367
SO SOMETIMES UNDER THAT LINE,

912
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:12,033
YOU MAY WANT TO ASK MORE

913
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:12,667
QUESTIONS OF THOSE PEOPLE SO IT

914
00:23:12,734 --> 00:23:13,233
GIVES YOU MORE AMMUNITION TO

915
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,443
MAKE AN ARTICULABLE REASON AS TO

916
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:15,300
WHY YOU'RE STRIKING THEM AND NOT

917
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:16,967
FOR RACE.

918
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:18,033
WOW.

919
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,967
IT'S PRETTY BIZARRE TO SEE A

920
00:23:19,033 --> 00:23:19,934
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SO

921
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,834
FLAGRANTLY TEACHING PEOPLE HOW

922
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,567
TO DO SOMETHING ILLEGAL.

923
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:23,793
IT'S LIKE IF "HOW TO GET AWAY

924
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:25,074
WITH MURDER" WAS AN EDUCATIONAL

925
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:26,734
SERIES WHERE VIOLA DAVIS

926
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,910
EXPLAINS HOW TO LITERALLY GET

927
00:23:27,934 --> 00:23:34,133
AWAY WITH MURDER.

928
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,934
WHICH SHE'D ABSOLUTELY CRUSH, BY

929
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,300
THE WAY.

930
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:35,967
I WOULD GLADLY WATCH MULTIPLE

931
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:36,567
SEASONS OF HER DESCRIBING IN

932
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:37,200
VIVID DETAIL HOW TO DISMEMBER A

933
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:37,800
CORPSE AND DISSOLVE THE BODY

934
00:23:37,867 --> 00:23:39,800
PARTS IN ACID.

935
00:23:39,867 --> 00:23:41,834
AND, LOOK, TO THIS DAY,

936
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,633
PROSECUTORS USE A WIDE VARIETY

937
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,700
OF BULLSHIT REASONS TO STRIKE

938
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:48,367
BLACK JURORS,

939
00:23:48,433 --> 00:23:49,000
SOME OF WHICH ARE JUST FLAT-OUT

940
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:49,767
RIDICULOUS, LIKE SAYING JURORS

941
00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:50,843
WERE TOO YOUNG, TOO OLD, SINGLE,

942
00:23:50,867 --> 00:23:52,000
DIVORCED, RELIGIOUS OR NOT

943
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:53,333
RELIGIOUS, LIVED IN A POOR PART

944
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,700
OF TOWN, HAD A HYPHENATED LAST

945
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,900
NAME, DISPLAYED BAD POSTURE, OR

946
00:23:56,967 --> 00:23:58,633
WERE SULLEN, DISRESPECTFUL, OR

947
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,233
TALKATIVE.

948
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,467
IN FACT, JUST LISTEN TO THIS

949
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:03,810
PUBLIC DEFENDER DESCRIBE A JUROR

950
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:05,200
STRIKE HE ONCE SAW:

951
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:06,133
I HAD A JUROR, AN

952
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,409
AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN, WHO WAS

953
00:24:07,433 --> 00:24:08,900
ACTUALLY EXCLUDED BECAUSE SHE

954
00:24:08,967 --> 00:24:09,734
WAS WEARING WHAT'S CALLED A

955
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,000
"PUFFY COAT."

956
00:24:13,066 --> 00:24:13,967
YEAH.

957
00:24:14,033 --> 00:24:15,500
SHE WAS EXCLUDED FOR

958
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:16,900
WEARING A PUFFY COAT.

959
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:17,734
A JACKET SHOULD NEVER BE AN

960
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,000
ACCEPTABLE REASON TO EXCLUDE

961
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:22,200
SOMEONE FROM A JURY.

962
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:23,000
UNLESS IT'S THE ONE THAT

963
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:23,667
POST MALONE WORE TO

964
00:24:23,734 --> 00:24:24,367
THE AMERICAN MUSIC AWARDS.

965
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:25,333
HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S SUPPOSED TO

966
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
JUMP OUT OF A CAKE AT A

967
00:24:26,467 --> 00:24:27,300
MARIACHI-THEMED GENDER REVEAL

968
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:28,633
PARTY.

969
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,633
AND IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE

970
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,433
LENGTHS TO WHICH PROSECUTORS ARE

971
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,800
WILLING TO GO, JUST LOOK AT THE

972
00:24:31,867 --> 00:24:33,009
MULTIPLE MURDER TRIALS OF CURTIS

973
00:24:33,033 --> 00:24:34,734
FLOWERS IN MISSISSIPPI.

974
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,834
HIS CASE MADE IT ALL THE WAY TO

975
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,767
THE SUPREME COURT, WHICH DECIDED

976
00:24:39,834 --> 00:24:41,967
THAT HIS PROSECUTOR HAD

977
00:24:42,033 --> 00:24:43,209
REPEATEDLY AND BLATANTLY TRIED

978
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:43,934
TO WHITEWASH THE JURY.

979
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,767
AND THAT OPINION WAS WRITTEN BY

980
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:45,700
MAYBE THE LAST JUSTICE YOU'D

981
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:47,133
EXPECT.

982
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,700
JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH WROTE

983
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:50,000
THAT A WHITE MISSISSIPPI

984
00:24:50,066 --> 00:24:52,033
PROSECUTOR'S GOAL WAS TO HAVE AN

985
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,333
ALL-WHITE JURY DECIDE THE FATE

986
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,033
OF AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN

987
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,233
ACCUSED OF MURDER, WHICH IS

988
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:58,033
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

989
00:24:58,066 --> 00:24:59,333
THE COURT'S NEWEST JUSTICE

990
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,600
SAID THAT DISTRICT ATTORNEY

991
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:01,776
DOUG EVANS WAGED A "RELENTLESS,

992
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,467
DETERMINED EFFORT TO RID THE

993
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:07,433
JURY OF BLACK INDIVIDUALS."

994
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,300
IT WAS CURTIS FLOWERS' SIXTH

995
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:09,300
TRIAL FOR THE SAME QUADRUPLE

996
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:10,834
MURDER.

997
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,200
KAVANAUGH POINTED TO A PATTERN,

998
00:25:13,266 --> 00:25:14,667
NOTING THAT EVANS HAD REMOVED

999
00:25:14,734 --> 00:25:16,033
41 OF THE 42 PROSPECTIVE BLACK

1000
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,667
JURORS OVER THE SIX TRIALS.

1001
00:25:19,734 --> 00:25:21,767
41 OF 42 JURORS!

1002
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:23,266
YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING

1003
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:24,576
WRONG WHEN IT'S SO FLAGRANT EVEN

1004
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,567
BRETT KAVANAUGH HAS A PROBLEM

1005
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:29,567
WITH IT... A MAN WHO'S DONE

1006
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:30,533
EXACTLY TWO GOOD THINGS IN HIS

1007
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,467
THIS DECISION AND MAKING

1008
00:25:31,533 --> 00:25:32,467
IT ACCEPTABLE TO SPEND YOUR

1009
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:33,609
ENTIRE JOB INTERVIEW SCREAMING

1010
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:35,200
AND CRYING.

1011
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:36,567
AND IT WASN'T JUST HOW OFTEN

1012
00:25:36,633 --> 00:25:37,500
THAT PROSECUTOR STRUCK BLACK

1013
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:38,643
JURORS... IT'S HOW BLATANTLY HE

1014
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:40,066
DID IT.

1015
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:41,300
BECAUSE WHILE, ON AVERAGE, HE

1016
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:43,133
ASKED THE WHITE JURORS WHO WERE

1017
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,934
SEATED ONE QUESTION, HE ASKED

1018
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,333
THE BLACK JURORS HE STRUCK 29.

1019
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,834
AND HOW DO YOU ASK ANYONE THAT

1020
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,967
MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ANYTHING?

1021
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:54,042
THAT'S TOO MANY, EVEN FOR A

1022
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:54,867
FIRST DATE WHO'S DESPERATELY

1023
00:25:54,934 --> 00:25:56,142
TRYING TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION

1024
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:57,333
GOING.

1025
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,509
"LET'S SEE, I'VE ASKED ABOUT

1026
00:25:58,533 --> 00:25:59,266
WHERE YOU GREW UP, WHAT YOU DO

1027
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:00,266
FOR WORK, WHETHER YOU LIKE YOUR

1028
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:01,233
JOB, WHETHER YOU HAVE ANY

1029
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,409
SIBLINGS, WHETHER YOUR SIBLINGS

1030
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:03,509
ARE OLDER OR YOUNGER, WHAT YOU

1031
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:04,467
LIKE TO DO FOR FUN, WHAT KIND OF

1032
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:08,967
MUSIC YOU LIKE...

1033
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:12,100
WHAT ELSE IS THERE?

1034
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:13,033
DO YOU LIKE RAKES?"

1035
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:13,934
AND A PROSPECTIVE JUROR IN ONE

1036
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,767
OF CURTIS FLOWERS' TRIALS FELT

1037
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:15,600
PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT WHY SHE'D

1038
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:16,300
BEEN STRUCK.

1039
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:17,376
THEY JUST TOLD US THEY DIDN'T

1040
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,266
NEED US.

1041
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:19,700
I THINK THEY MIGHT HAVE ASSUMED

1042
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:21,533
THAT BECAUSE I WAS BLACK THAT I

1043
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,133
WAS GOING TO AGREE WITH THAT HE

1044
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,309
WAS INNOCENT JUST BY THE COLOR

1045
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,333
OF HIS SKIN.

1046
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:26,633
BUT I ACTUALLY WOULD HAVE

1047
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,500
LISTENED TO THE EVIDENCE AND HAD

1048
00:26:27,567 --> 00:26:28,367
AN OPEN EAR.

1049
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:29,443
I ACTUALLY WAS LOOKING FORWARD

1050
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:34,066
TO SERVING.

1051
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:34,800
LOOK, IT IS RIDICULOUS

1052
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:35,400
TO ASSUME THAT A JUROR WILL BE

1053
00:26:35,467 --> 00:26:36,467
BIASED JUST BECAUSE THE

1054
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:37,100
DEFENDANT IS THE SAME RACE.

1055
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:38,433
OF COURSE A BLACK PERSON CAN BE

1056
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,166
IMPARTIAL WHEN THE DEFENDANT IS

1057
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:40,133
BLACK, IN THE SAME WAY THAT I

1058
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,500
COULD BE IMPARTIAL IF THE

1059
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:42,834
DEFENDANT WAS AN OWL.

1060
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,734
TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE IS

1061
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,910
EXTREMELY INSULTING, NOT JUST TO

1062
00:26:44,934 --> 00:26:47,533
MYSELF, BUT TO ALL OWLS.

1063
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,700
AND THESE DECISIONS HAVE

1064
00:26:48,767 --> 00:26:50,333
CONSEQUENCES.

1065
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,266
CURTIS FLOWERS SPENT 20 YEARS ON

1066
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:56,834
DEATH ROW AND IS CURRENTLY OUT

1067
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,633
ON BAIL AWAITING A POTENTIAL

1068
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,467
SEVENTH TRIAL.

1069
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,333
SO TAKEN ALL TOGETHER, IT'S

1070
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,476
CLEAR THAT, FROM HOW WE DECIDE

1071
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,700
WHO SERVES TO HOW THE LIST IS

1072
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:02,433
ADMINISTERED THROUGH WHO WE LET

1073
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,000
LAWYERS SELECT, WE'RE MAKING A

1074
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:05,346
MOCKERY OF THE PHRASE "A JURY OF

1075
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,567
YOUR PEERS."

1076
00:27:06,633 --> 00:27:07,400
BECAUSE WHO, EXACTLY, IS THE

1077
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:08,633
"YOU" THERE?

1078
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,000
THE DEFENDANT'S PEERS?

1079
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:11,533
OR THE PROSECUTOR'S PEERS?

1080
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,667
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.

1081
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:16,200
AND AS WE'VE SEEN, THE IMPACT OF

1082
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:17,567
HAVING PEOPLE IN A JURY ROOM WHO

1083
00:27:17,633 --> 00:27:20,934
CAN SPEAK TO WHAT BEING BLACK IN

1084
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,667
AMERICA IS LIKE AND HOW THAT

1085
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:22,500
MIGHT AFFECT YOUR RELATIONSHIP

1086
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:23,433
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN BE

1087
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,600
HUGELY BENEFICIAL.

1088
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:26,133
AND YES, THAT MIGHT MAKE A

1089
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,400
PROSECUTOR'S JOB A BIT MORE

1090
00:27:27,467 --> 00:27:29,266
DIFFICULT, BUT THE ROLE OF A

1091
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:30,409
COURT IS NOT TO MAKE IT FUCKING

1092
00:27:30,433 --> 00:27:32,533
EASY BY HAVING CASES HEARD ONLY

1093
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,500
BY A GROUP OF WHITE PEOPLE...

1094
00:27:34,567 --> 00:27:35,676
OR, TO USE THE PROPER COLLECTIVE

1095
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,533
NOUN FOR THAT, "A WHOLE FOODS."

1096
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,700
I'M SERIOUS, TRY IT IN A

1097
00:27:40,767 --> 00:27:41,400
SENTENCE.

1098
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:43,734
"LOOK AT THAT GAGGLE

1099
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,967
OF GEESE FLYING OVER THAT

1100
00:27:45,033 --> 00:27:46,200
WHOLE FOODS OF ABIGAILS."

1101
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:46,767
SO HOW DO WE FIX THIS?

1102
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:47,667
WELL, THERE ARE FOUR BASIC STEPS

1103
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:48,400
WE COULD TAKE.

1104
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:49,166
ONE, BROADEN JURY POOL LISTS SO

1105
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:50,033
THEY DON'T EXCLUDE LARGE

1106
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,567
SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY.

1107
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:52,367
SOME HAVE SUGGESTED USING INCOME

1108
00:27:52,433 --> 00:27:54,033
TAX LISTS, FOR INSTANCE.

1109
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,343
TWO, MAKE THAT DATA PUBLIC SO WE

1110
00:27:55,367 --> 00:27:57,066
CAN SEE IF THERE WERE ERRORS IN

1111
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,934
COMPILING POTENTIAL JURORS.

1112
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,700
THIRD, INCREASE JUROR PAY SO

1113
00:28:00,767 --> 00:28:02,066
THAT PEOPLE WHO MISS WORK DON'T

1114
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:04,500
SUFFER FINANCIAL HARDSHIP.

1115
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:05,710
AND FINALLY, REFORM THE PROCESS

1116
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:06,974
BEHIND PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES TO

1117
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:08,033
MAKE IT MORE PRACTICALLY

1118
00:28:08,066 --> 00:28:09,400
DIFFICULT TO STRIKE JURORS BY

1119
00:28:09,467 --> 00:28:10,233
RACE.

1120
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,367
AND WHILE, YES, THIS IS A LOT OF

1121
00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:14,734
WORK, IT'S WORTH IT, BECAUSE AS

1122
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,233
WE'VE DISCUSSED BEFORE, EVERY

1123
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,000
GEAR IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

1124
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,633
SYSTEM IS UNFAIRLY BIASED

1125
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,133
AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR... FROM

1126
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,700
POLICING TO BAIL TO THE SHORTAGE

1127
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:25,200
OF PUBLIC DEFENDERS TO PUNITIVE

1128
00:28:25,266 --> 00:28:26,700
SENTENCING TO INCARCERATION TO

1129
00:28:26,767 --> 00:28:28,633
RE-ENTRY FROM PRISON.

1130
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,100
AND THIS IS YET ANOTHER TO ADD

1131
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,433
TO THAT DEPRESSING LIST.

1132
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,667
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, TOO OFTEN,

1133
00:28:32,734 --> 00:28:34,633
OUR CURRENT SYSTEM WOULD

1134
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,800
SYSTEMATICALLY WEED OUT A

1135
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:37,667
QUALIFIED PERSON WHO ACTUALLY

1136
00:28:37,734 --> 00:28:39,100
WANTS TO SERVE AND LEAVE IN

1137
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,467
SOMEONE WHO AGGRESSIVELY DOESN'T

1138
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:41,676
BECAUSE HE CAN'T WATCH HBO AND

1139
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,734
FUCK IN THE JURY BOX.

1140
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:49,533
AND NOW THIS.

1141
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,333
AND NOW, JIM

1142
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,333
CRAMER'S FUN TIME QUARANTINE

1143
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,900
ACTIVITY MAKES YOU SAD.

1144
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:58,967
WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY ZOOM

1145
00:28:59,033 --> 00:29:00,309
ADAPTATIONS ON OUR NETWORK AND I

1146
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:03,033
HAVE HAD TO BE IN ZOOM BRUNCHES,

1147
00:29:03,133 --> 00:29:03,567
WHATEVER.

1148
00:29:03,633 --> 00:29:05,900
I'M NOT TELLING YOU TO DO YOUR

1149
00:29:05,967 --> 00:29:06,900
BANKING ON ZOOM.

1150
00:29:06,967 --> 00:29:08,467
I AM TELLING YOU TO DO YOUR

1151
00:29:08,533 --> 00:29:13,033
BOOZY BRUNCH.

1152
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,867
OUR NOW... MY BOOZY BRUNCH PAID

1153
00:29:16,934 --> 00:29:18,900
FOR NEXT SATURDAY'S BOOZY

1154
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:19,433
BRUNCH.

1155
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,333
MY ZOOM BRUNCH.

1156
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,033
I YOU DO MY BOOZY BRUNCH.

1157
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,133
I CANNOT WAIT UNTIL SUNDAY,

1158
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,533
BECAUSE SUNDAY IS HER BOOZY

1159
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,100
BRUNCH ENABLED BY ZOOM.

1160
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:31,266
I WAS VICIOUSLY OVERSERVED

1161
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:32,667
LAST SUNDAY, EVEN THOUGH I AM

1162
00:29:32,734 --> 00:29:34,467
LIVING ALONE.

1163
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,820
IT THAT'S OUR SHOW.
