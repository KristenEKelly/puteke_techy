LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,840
Season VII
Episode 3

3
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,640
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,080
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

5
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,880
It has been a busy week,
so there is frankly no time

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
for us to talk about the U.S. signing
a deal with the Taliban,

7
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,200
or Joe Biden
winning in South Carolina,

8
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,360
or even the end of billionaire
Tom Steyer's presidential run,

9
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,040
despite the fact the closing days
of his campaign got weird.

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,640
This is businessman
Tom Steyer with Juvenile up on stage.

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,080
Dancing to "Back That Ass Up".

12
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,040
I have a few questions there.
One, the fuck ?

13
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,040
You spent a quarter billion dollars
on your campaign, was it worth it ?

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,320
And three, that song
is called "Back That Ass Up",

15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,600
why are you not
backing your ass up ?

16
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,360
No one told you to lurch forward

17
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,800
and then do a weird
little lasso that ass up.

18
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,040
Juvenile is standing right next to you
and he's clear about what he wants:

19
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,000
payment in full for this inexplicable
campaign appearance

20
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,480
and also for you
to back your fucking ass up.

21
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,920
No wonder
your campaign failed.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,240
But look, tonight, we're actually
gonna do something different.

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,160
Let's dive straight in with
our main story tonight,

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,800
which concerns the subject that
has dominated the news all week.

25
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,000
Global hot zones,
the coronavirus spreading.

26
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,240
Fears grow of a global pandemic.

27
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,400
A huge spike in cases in Italy.

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,520
Hundreds of cases in South Korea.
New cases reported in Europe.

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,520
The CDC warned Americans
to be prepared here at home,

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,680
that it's not a matter of if,
but when.

31
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,240
Yes, the coronavirus.
On Tuesday, the CDC said

32
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,000
that its spreading here is not
a question of if, but when.

33
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,800
Not a comforting thing to hear
about the spread of something deadly.

34
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,200
Only if you talk about whether
Saoirse Ronan will win an Oscar

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,280
or whether Henry Kissinger
will ever die.

36
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,280
Don't worry ! It's not
a question of if, but when.

37
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,280
And the CDC were not wrong,

38
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,600
there are now several dozen
confirmed cases here in the US,

39
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,720
with the first death
coming just yesterday.

40
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,880
The stock market has taken
its biggest one-week dive since 2008

41
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,400
and many Americans have questions
about how to stay safe.

42
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,840
Joy Johnson emailed us asking:

43
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,920
"Can I get coronavirus from
a package being delivered from China ?"

44
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,400
A great question.

45
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,200
Talk about these masks.
Do we get them or don't we ?

46
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,400
Some are wondering if you
can you protect yourself

47
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,680
from the virus
by gargling with bleach.

48
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,560
- What ?
- Or taking steroids.

49
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,640
Can you get the coronavirus
by eating Chinese food ?

50
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,360
No, no you can't.

51
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,040
Of course you can't get the coronavirus
from eating Chinese food.

52
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,880
If you're eating at a Panda Express,

53
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,360
you can't even get Chinese food
by eating Chinese food.

54
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,080
Although, I will say this,

55
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,720
you are unlikely to get the coronavirus
if you regularly gargle bleach.

56
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,280
You know what they say: being
dead is already the best medicine.

57
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,640
It might be helpful to get the very
basics down here straight away.

58
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,920
What we're talking about is
a sickness called COVID-19,

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,280
caused
by a new strain of coronavirus.

60
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,840
Symptoms include fever,
cough, and shortness of breath

61
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,040
and preliminary estimates are that
it has a two percent mortality rate

62
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,720
with the elderly and those with
pre-existing conditions most at risk.

63
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,480
I know some people don't seem
to think that 2 percent is all that bad

64
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,560
as Chuck Todd told us
in the weirdest possible way.

65
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,280
So, last night I surprised
my teenager when I told him

66
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,040
that only 2 percent of those
that get this coronavirus die.

67
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,280
He goes:
"I thought it was much worse."

68
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,880
And I understand
if you just digest social media,

69
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,400
you just digest the headlines,
this feels more deadly than it is.

70
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,200
Okay, so first,
on behalf of your teenager:

71
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,200
"Dad, get out of my room
and stop telling me the news".

72
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,640
But second,
two percent of people is a lot

73
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,240
when you're talking
about those people dying.

74
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,760
Think about it this way,
two percent of people disappearing

75
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,480
was literally
the premise of "The Leftovers",

76
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,200
the show whose pilot did not
consist of Justin Theroux going:

77
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,280
"That was rough but to be honest,
could've been worse !"

78
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,800
and then the show ended.

79
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,440
The fact is, a two percent
mortality rate, if true,

80
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,400
would be about 20 times
higher than the seasonal flu.

81
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,720
While the good news is

82
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,120
around 80 percent of those who get
this virus have mild symptoms,

83
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,320
the bad news is,

84
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,080
that means they are more likely
to spread it without even realizing.

85
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,720
That is one of the things
that makes this so dangerous,

86
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,840
and why, even though
its mortality rate is much lower

87
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,480
than that of SARS or MERS,

88
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,720
this virus has already killed
three times as many people.

89
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,280
One expert has predicted that 40
to 70 percent of the world's population

90
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,480
will be infected
within the next year.

91
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,760
Which is upsetting because
there's only one infectious disease

92
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,080
that two-thirds of the world
should be getting now

93
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,960
and that's
Adam Driver fever.

94
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,360
Shatter my knees,
you fuckable redwood.

95
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,120
Snap off my toes,
you big, unwashed buffalo.

96
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,280
If the stock market is tanking

97
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,880
and people are considering
gargling bleach,

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,760
we thought tonight might be a good
time to talk about the coronavirus,

99
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,320
how we got to this point,
what's currently being done

100
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,000
and how this virus has exposed
governmental vulnerabilities

101
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,000
as it has spread around the world.

102
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,200
Let's start
with how all of this began.

103
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,880
The first documented cases

104
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,680
cropped up at the end of last year
in Wuhan, China.

105
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,640
Initially, the Chinese government
wasn't just slow to respond,

106
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,000
officials tried to silence
and punish medical professionals

107
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,600
who tried to raise the alarm,

108
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,280
which almost certainly helped
the disease to spread.

109
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,160
When the Chinese leadership
finally decided to act,

110
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,520
it moved aggressively, putting
nearly 50 million people on lockdown.

111
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,960
One month after Wuhan
sealed off its borders,

112
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,320
its roads are empty and
construction sites are abandoned.

113
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,600
Residents had been permitted
to leave their residential compounds

114
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,840
once every seven days,
but this week,

115
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,360
loudspeakers placed on street corners
notified households of a change.

116
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,000
From now on,
nobody can go out.

117
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,320
Holy shit.
A talking box that tells you

118
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,720
you can't leave your house
feels pretty dystopian.

119
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,880
I much prefer our dystopia,

120
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,480
where a talking box listens
to all our conversations

121
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,720
and then tells Jeff Bezos when
I'll need underwear next.

122
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,400
It's such a convenient way
to give up everything.

123
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,600
People on lockdown in China
are in a very unpleasant situation,

124
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,480
but they've been doing their best
to try and amuse themselves,

125
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,360
like this man, who either
improvised a cool mask

126
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,120
or found a socially acceptable reason
to indulge in a very specific fetish.

127
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,560
Other citizens
made makeshift hazmat suits

128
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,960
out of inflatable Christmas tree
and dinosaur costumes,

129
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,080
while others, indoors, were reduced
to creating their own entertainment

130
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,280
like playing snooker
with chopsticks and cherry tomatoes.

131
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,080
That is the most culinary
resourcefulness that I've seen

132
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,240
since Claire from Bon Appetit Test
Kitchen made Combos from scratch.

133
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,640
I don't know why you do
this to yourself, Claire.

134
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,320
They sell them in stores !

135
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,560
Despite the government
effort at containment,

136
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,040
over 27 hundred people
have now died in China,

137
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,320
among them Dr. Li Wenliang,
an early whistleblower

138
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,360
silenced by officials,
who has since become a symbol

139
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,960
for citizens' anger
at their government's response.

140
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,760
That is how this all began.

141
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,440
The coronavirus has since spread
to more than 60 other countries,

142
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,560
who've handled it
with varying degrees of success.

143
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,760
Vietnam, for instance,
moved quickly,

144
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,280
and among other things, produced
this public information video

145
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,320
about how to limit its spread
through proper hygiene.

146
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,320
Yes, yes...

147
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,160
Vietnam made a song
about washing your hands

148
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,720
to prevent coronavirus infection
and it absolutely slaps.

149
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,040
That's a genuine club banger,
right there.

150
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,120
People like that song so much,
it became a TikTok dance challenge.

151
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
The song's incredible !

152
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,160
It makes all other songs about
washing yourself look like trash.

153
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,920
I'm talking
to you here, Ernie.

154
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,920
You've been on top of the pile for
a long time, but you got complacent.

155
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,360
While other artists
were out there innovating,

156
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,720
you kept singing
the same old ducky song.

157
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,400
You lost the hunger, son.

158
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,800
You fell asleep at the wheel and
music moved on without you.

159
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,240
Not all countries have responded
quite as well.

160
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,440
Japan famously botched its handling
of the cruise ship Diamond Princess

161
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,720
by quarantining more than
35-hundred passengers and crew

162
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,280
on the ship itself,
which had disastrous results.

163
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,520
More than 620 cases
have been confirmed

164
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,360
among the passengers
and crew on the cruise ship,

165
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,560
raising worries about how the virus
was able to spread so rapidly

166
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,360
among people
who should have been isolated.

167
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,520
I'll tell you how it spread so rapidly.
They were on a cruise ship.

168
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,640
Under the best of circumstances,
a cruise ship is a floating petri dish.

169
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,000
You might as well have held them
in a Chuck E. Cheese ball pit.

170
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,560
The spread was so bad that
seven passengers have since died

171
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,280
and the WHO's list of coronavirus
cases by country

172
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,320
had a separate line
just for the Diamond Princess.

173
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,120
Which is terrifying, although,
again, in terms of cruises,

174
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,400
still not the worst.

175
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,760
If your options are
the Diamond Princess

176
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,600
or the actual Carnival cruise

177
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,280
where the toilets are so full of shit
they are falling off the walls,

178
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,240
I'm booking the S.S. Coronavirus
10 times out of 10.

179
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,840
10 out of 10.

180
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,480
And in some countries,
the response was handled so badly,

181
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,560
you could watch the virus
spread live on television.

182
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,160
In Iran, a government spokesperson
attempted to reassure people

183
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,880
that the virus was under control,
while the deputy health minister

184
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,560
started mopping away fever sweat
like an Alabama preacher.

185
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,200
That guy was later confirmed
to have the coronavirus,

186
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,800
not before going on TV again
to explain away his symptoms

187
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,720
while coughing all over
the fucking studio.

188
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,920
And if that wasn't bad enough,
which it is,

189
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,040
it turns out the Iranian people now
trust their government so little,

190
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,440
they think
he was staging the whole thing.

191
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,240
They say they're lying
that they have corona,

192
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,600
this is a propaganda.

193
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,240
- They think he's not got it ?
- They say he's lying.

194
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,520
And in three days
he's gonna come out to say:

195
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,320
"I'm recovered,
it's not serious, don't worry."

196
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,760
The level of mistrust towards
Iranian politicians is so deep

197
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,800
that they wouldn't believe anything
that comes out of their mouth.

198
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,080
Iranians won't believe anything that
comes out of their politicians' mouths,

199
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,400
even if that thing
is the actual coronavirus.

200
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,480
That is a huge problem.
Because it is going to be hard

201
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,440
for any government to give effective
advice if people don't believe in them.

202
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,200
Trust in institutions is critical when
trying to contain a possible pandemic.

203
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,600
Unfortunately, that brings us to
the US' response to this virus

204
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,400
and specifically to this guy.

205
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,440
The White House's messaging
has been all over the place this week.

206
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,120
On Tuesday, the very same day
that the CDC said

207
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,840
that the spread of coronavirus in US
was "not a question of if, but when",

208
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,880
one of Trump's top advisers
was on TV saying this.

209
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,320
We have contained this.

210
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,920
I won't say airtight,
but pretty close to airtight.

211
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,920
Which is it ?

212
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,720
Because "airtight"
versus "close to airtight"

213
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,720
is a pretty crucial distinction !

214
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,760
It's the difference between
having a working submarine

215
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,840
and a cool metal tube to die in.

216
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,800
The dissonance there
speaks to a real problem.

217
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,600
In a global health emergency,

218
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,120
you want to hear
from the many trained experts

219
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,840
who we're lucky enough to have working
in our nation's public health agencies.

220
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,680
You do not want
to hear from politicians.

221
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,880
Yet, on Wednesday, the president
had a surprise announcement.

222
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,720
President Trump alongside
his top health advisers

223
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,920
sought to calm a nervous nation,

224
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,640
naming a new point person to lead
the administration's response.

225
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,800
I'm gonna be putting our
vice president, Mike Pence, in charge.

226
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,760
He's got a certain talent for this.

227
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,640
Does he ?
Does he though ?

228
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,880
I was under the impression the only
things Pence had a certain talent for

229
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,080
were avoiding off-leash women,
sucking up to people

230
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,360
who represent the antithesis
of everything he claims to believe in,

231
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,160
and miserably failing at pulling off
a haircut known as "The Judi Dench".

232
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,600
Putting aside Pence's, to put it
mildly, extremely mixed record

233
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,440
as governor of Indiana
on managing public health issues,

234
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,600
even the announcement
that he would be leading the task force

235
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,880
was a debacle.

236
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,880
Alex Azar, the Secretary
of Health and Human Services,

237
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,840
was already supposed
to be chairing that task force

238
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,920
and Trump didn't seem
interested in clarifying their roles

239
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,280
or, indeed,
really being there at all.

240
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,680
Wish him good luck. Who ?

241
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,280
Is Secretary Azar, given the Pence
move, still going to be...

242
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,480
If I could just clarify, you're
not getting the point here of this,

243
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,760
I'm still chairman
of the task force.

244
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,800
- You don't feel like being replaced ?
- Not in the least.

245
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,320
When this was mentioned to me,
I said I was delighted that I get

246
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,040
to have the vice president
helping in this way.

247
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,920
Delighted. Absolutely.

248
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,360
Yeah. He just left.

249
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,840
This was a press conference meant
to calm the nation

250
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,040
and with the most basic question
of who would be running things

251
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,000
seemingly up in the air,
he just fucked right off.

252
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,840
I know we're used to only
seeing businessman Trump,

253
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,440
but it is nice to get a glimpse
of the absentee father in him, too.

254
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,240
It is more
than just a lack of leadership.

255
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,880
It is also concerning that Trump's
focus, when discussing this virus,

256
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,520
seems to be downplaying
any potentially bad news.

257
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,840
He twitted: "The Coronavirus
is very much under control".

258
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,840
There was no way to be sure of that,
as he frankly should have known.

259
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,960
Many of the test kits
the CDC initially developed

260
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,280
to detect the virus apparently
didn't work as expected.

261
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,520
Meaning that,
as recently as Wednesday,

262
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,760
the CDC and only six state labs
were testing for the virus.

263
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,160
Thankfully,
that has since been fixed,

264
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,640
and we're presumably
going to find more cases now.

265
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,720
Trump seemed reluctant to admit
that that will happen.

266
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,080
You can watch
that dynamic in real time,

267
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,880
as officials at the press
conference say one thing

268
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,680
and he tries to massage it
into something else.

269
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,040
We can expect to see more cases
in the United States.

270
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,360
We do expect more cases.

271
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,880
When you have 15 people and
the 15 within a couple of days

272
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:33,080
is gonna be down to close to zero,
that's a pretty good job we've done.

273
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,040
Yeah. But it won't be
close to zero, will it ?

274
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,800
Your experts just said cases will go up
and you said they will go down.

275
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,160
You can't just ignore real numbers
and make up ones that you like better.

276
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,280
This is the problem with a president
whose entire life has been

277
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,080
a series of low-stakes lies.

278
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,920
A man who has lied about, among
other things, his net worth,

279
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,080
his Apprentice ratings,
the number of floors in Trump Tower,

280
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,280
the size of his Electoral College
victory, the attendance at his rallies,

281
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,240
whether it rained at his inaugural
and even whether or not

282
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,480
he was invited on this
"very boring and low rated show".

283
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,040
Which he wasn't !
He wasn't ! It was a lie !

284
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,240
But there is a difference

285
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,720
between lying about something
that means literally nothing,

286
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,840
and lying about the spread
of a deadly disease.

287
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,240
And that is not the only time
that Trump has peddled false hope.

288
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,120
If you've seen him speak
on this virus at all lately,

289
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,720
you may've seen him repeatedly
reassure everyone

290
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,280
that there is a chance the end of
the outbreak is just around the corner.

291
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,200
There's a theory that in April,
when it gets warm,

292
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,680
historically that has been
able to kill the virus.

293
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,160
A lot of people think that goes away
in April, as the heat comes in.

294
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,160
In April, supposedly, it dies
with the hotter weather,

295
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,560
and that's a beautiful date
to look forward to.

296
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,160
Okay, so first: never call
calendar dates "beautiful".

297
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,720
I don't know how he did it,

298
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,520
but I'm pretty sure Trump just sexually
harassed the month of April.

299
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,560
But second: again, the truth
is much more complicated there.

300
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,880
Because yes, some viruses
do recede in warmer months.

301
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,800
And yes, history's worst
flu pandemic, in 1918,

302
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,840
did ebb away over the summer.

303
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,680
But it is worth knowing that,
come the fall, the virus returned,

304
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,200
was far more severe,

305
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,600
and ended up killing nearly
200 000 Americans in October alone.

306
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,000
This is a bad time to have
a president who can not speak clearly.

307
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,240
There's already enough bad
information flying around.

308
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,600
The president's favorite channel has
been a particular offender here.

309
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,480
Fox anchors and guests have
repeatedly amplified false claims,

310
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,320
from the idea that the virus was
created in a Chinese bioweapons lab,

311
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,160
to the baseless internet rumor

312
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,920
that it came from Chinese people
eating bat soup,

313
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,080
which one commentator used as
an excuse to say how he really feels.

314
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,440
Bat soup may be delicious
to certain people.

315
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,880
Unfortunately, bats are the world's
greatest reservoir for viruses.

316
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,400
What are we gonna do
about China ?

317
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,240
What are we gonna do about
its totalitarian dictatorship

318
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:09,640
where it's okay to sell live
virus-infected bats in marketplaces

319
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,520
and then have business travel
and tourist travel

320
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,200
between that country
and the civilized world ?

321
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,960
That escalated quickly. He moves
from the vaguely dog-whistle-y

322
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,880
"what are we gonna do about China"

323
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,760
to "it's not part of the civilized
world" at lightning speed.

324
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,960
Truly, that man
is the Usain Bolt of racism,

325
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,040
a comparison I'm certain
he absolutely hates.

326
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,000
It gets worse.

327
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,600
Because some people are even clearly
trying to profit off the present panic,

328
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,600
like televangelist Jim Bakker, who has
a cure that he'd love to sell you.

329
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,480
Would you recommend,
as a doctor,

330
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,440
people to have silver
in their house for a pandemic ?

331
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,520
You never wanna be
without silver.

332
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,480
You're saying that Silver Solution
would be effective ?

333
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,440
Let's say it hasn't been tested
on this strain of the coronavirus

334
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,200
but it's been tested on other
strains of the coronavirus

335
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,800
and has been able to eliminate it
within 12 hours.

336
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,920
Totally eliminate it.
Kills it... De-activates it.

337
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,720
Okay, that is ridiculous.
Silver does not kill coronavirus.

338
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,520
Silver kills werewolves.
Which means first,

339
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,320
you need to get your coronavirus bitten
by a microscopic werewolf.

340
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,720
Where am I gonna find one
of those in this economy ?

341
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,920
That's right,
from our online store.

342
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,800
For just $49.99, we will send you

343
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,040
John Oliver's
Premium Werewolf Solution.

344
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,760
It contains millions of microscopic
werewolves ready to spread

345
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,120
their bestial curse
to your coronavirus.

346
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,520
And then, you can use
the Silver Solution,

347
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,400
which is based on the exact
same amount of science.

348
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,600
The truth is...

349
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,200
While clinical trials are underway,

350
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,440
there is no treatment for
coronavirus at the moment,

351
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,040
and a vaccine could take between
a year and 18 months to develop.

352
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,480
At this point, you may be wondering,
how scared should you be.

353
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,600
And the answer
is probably a bit.

354
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,520
I don't want to be alarmist here,

355
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,360
but I also don't want to minimize
what we could be facing.

356
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,120
It's really about trying
to strike a sensible balance.

357
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,400
If you're drinking bleach to protect
yourself right now,

358
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,680
you should probably
calm the fuck down.

359
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:30,000
If you lick subway poles because
you're certain nothing can hurt you,

360
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,600
maybe don't do that.

361
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,200
You want to stay somewhere
between those extremes.

362
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,000
Don't be complacent
and don't be a fucking idiot.

363
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,240
As a practical matter, until experts
advise that this threat is over,

364
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,320
we should all be
following some basic advice.

365
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,800
First: don't be racist.

366
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,080
That's just good general advice
for now and for later.

367
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,640
Two: don't hoard masks.

368
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,120
While I understand
that you might want to do that,

369
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,280
you are taking away those masks
from the people who really need them:

370
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,400
healthcare providers
and those who are sick.

371
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,280
Three: check the CDC website
for future updates,

372
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,920
because they could have additional
guidance as this develops.

373
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,560
And this is more important
than it might sound,

374
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,760
wash your hands regularly,
for at least 20 seconds.

375
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,000
I know that that last lesson
is boring and easy to forget,

376
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,960
but luckily, we now know,
that there is a way to ensure

377
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,440
that it absolutely
never leaves your head.

378
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,560
Hit it !

379
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,880
That song fucks.
That fucks so hard. And now this.

380
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,600
Chris Matthews Just Cannot
Seem to Nail His Sign-Off.

381
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,080
That's Hardball, for now.
Thanks for being with us.

382
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,040
All In with Chris Hayes
starts right now.

383

That's Hardball for now.
Thanks for being with us.

384
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:01,440
That's Hardball for now.
Thanks for being with us tonight.

385
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,560
Thanks per being with us tonight.
Thanks for being us.

386
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,560
Thank for being with us.
All In with Chris Hayes starts now.

387
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,120
Thanks for being with us in...
All In with Chris Hayes starts now.

388
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,920
All In with Chris Hayes starts now.

389
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,760
All In with MSN...
All In with Chris Hayes starts now.

390
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,680
All In with Chris Hayes.
That's Hardball for now.

391
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,760
All In with Chris Hayes
right now.

392
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:35,360
Moving on. Finally tonight,
I want to talk to you about baseball.

393
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,440
The only sport that involves
reading made-up sign language

394
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,920
while staring directly
at someone's dick.

395
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,480
That's what the sport is.

396
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,520
With the new season
just around the corner,

397
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,320
a huge scandal has engulfed the sport
and I'm not referring

398
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,560
to the Houston Astros cheating
their way to a championship.

399
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,240
I'm actually talking
about something even more important.

400
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,360
He's one of the most recognizable
mascots in sports

401
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,320
but he could soon be
a free agent.

402
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,960
Unless the team pays out
millions of dollars to keep 'em,

403
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,800
the Phillie Phanatic
could be a thing of the past.

404
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,880
Why do you feel like
it's the heart and soul of the team ?

405
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,520
He embodies everything that
is Philadelphia. He's real !

406
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,600
I hate to break it to that guy,
because based on his face paint,

407
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,600
mullet and colorful bandana,
he's living his absolute best life,

408
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,760
but the Phillie Phanatic
is not actually real.

409
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,240
He's just a person in a costume.
Fun fact: the person inside it ?

410
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,840
Jessica Lange. And she has never
missed a single game.

411
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,040
But it is true, the Phillies
are in a lawsuit over their own mascot

412
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,280
and the concern is, that they
could lose the rights to it.

413
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,600
If you've never heard
of the Phanatic before,

414
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,680
you're frankly in for a treat,
because he's absolutely incredible.

415
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,840
Here he is teaching his cousin Gritty
how to do his signature belly dance.

416
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,360
Here he is dumping popcorn
all over the Phillies' TV broadcasters.

417
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,240
Here he is firing hot dogs
from a cannon into the crowd.

418
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,800
Here he is dressed in a Kiss outfit
playing a guitar that's firing sparks.

419
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,400
And here he is blindsiding
a minor league baseball mascot

420
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,240
who was running the bases.

421
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,840
Was that other mascot okay ?
Ask yourself this: does it matter ?

422
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,240
Last year, the Phanatic released

423
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,800
a four-hour-long Yule Log
video for Christmas,

424
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,760
much of which is him just sitting
in a rocking chair, reading a book,

425
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,920
roasting marshmallows
in the fireplace,

426
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,720
and at one point,
getting tangled in Christmas lights.

427
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,680
No respect to Martin Scorsese,

428
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,720
but that is clearly the best
four-hour film of 2019.

429
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,280
It's not even close.

430
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:39,640
The Phanatic is an absolute master
of the mascotical arts.

431
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,640
This lawsuit
is genuinely complicated.

432
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,040
It revolves around whether the company
who helped design the Phanatic

433
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,960
has the right to reclaim the copyright
after what's been 35 years.

434
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,440
The filings in this case
are spectacular.

435
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,720
Among other things,
the two parties bicker about

436
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,480
whether the Phanatic
is a costume

437
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,720
or, as the company claimed
in its original submission

438
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,920
to the U.S. Copyright Office,
an "artistic sculpture".

439
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,440
The Phillies argue that
without someone in the costume,

440
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,600
the Phanatic
would have appeared formless.

441
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,040
And to illustrate that,
they provided this actual photo

442
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,280
of an empty costume
lying on the floor.

443
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,080
Which would be the most horrifying
way for this guy to find out

444
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,920
that the Phanatic is not real.

445
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,920
Never show him that photo.
He can not handle it.

446
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,640
Last Sunday, the dispute
took yet another turn,

447
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,760
when, in a move that some
think was prompted by the lawsuit,

448
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,520
the Phillies introduced
a brand new Phanatic design.

449
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,680
Many changes are subtle,
like a shorter snout,

450
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,800
a lighter blue color
around the eyes,

451
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,680
a pair of red shoes and blue socks
and scales under the arms.

452
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,520
The longer blue tail
was a bit more obvious.

453
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,680
It might not look to you
like there is much of a difference

454
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,560
between the new
and the old Phanatic.

455
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,280
But believe me,
there very much is.

456
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,800
And forget the fact that he now
has scales for no reason,

457
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,480
or the bullshit star
shapes around his eyes,

458
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,840
they changed
the Phanatic's honker.

459
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,240
Look at it ! It's a cylinder now.
Which is ridiculous.

460
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,880
The Phanatic's honker
is supposed to be conical !

461
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,080
He's supposed
to have a conical honker !

462
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,040
Now they've made him look stupid.
You respect the conical honker !

463
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,280
Hashtag
#RespectTheConicalHonker.

464
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,440
The point is: the old Phanatic
was perfect just the way he was.

465
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,960
Look at him: he's a Sesame Place 10 !
But now ?

466
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,360
He's a Times Square six,
at best.

467
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,760
I'm not the only one
who hates this new design.

468
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,400
Fans in Philadelphia even started
the hashtag #NotMyPhanatic,

469
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,480
which they've used
to voice their justified anger.

470
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,560
But the most important part
of this story

471
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,360
is that if the Phillies lose this case,
there is a question

472
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,360
over whether the Phanatic could,
theoretically, become a free agent.

473
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,760
Meaning, he could move
to a different team

474
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,600
or a different brand entirely.

475
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,280
And that, my friends,
is where we come in.

476
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:57,080
We're no stranger
to the mascot game here.

477
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,120
We've never had an official
show mascot before.

478
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,640
And to be honest,
after learning about this,

479
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,800
I'm feeling like I kind
of want one now.

480
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,720
If the Phanatic does
indeed hit the open market,

481
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,320
we are putting ourselves
at the front of that line.

482
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,680
So Phanatic, if you are tired
of being treated terribly,

483
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,840
we have an offer
that we'd like you to consider.

484
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,320
You were the face of Philadelphia
sports for over 40 years.

485
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,760
The Phillie Phanatic.

486
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,000
But all good things
must come to an end.

487
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,360
Sometimes a hero needs
a new challenge, a new home,

488
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,560
a home that doesn't want to change you
into whatever the fuck this is.

489
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,720
A home that respects
the conical honker.

490
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,760
Sure, they tried to knock you
down in the past,

491
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,040
but champions don't stay down.

492
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,360
They get back up, dust off their fur,
show the world what they're made of.
