1
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,980
Hi there!

2
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:32,980
Welcome to the show!

3
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,980
Still coming to you from this

4
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,980
white void, which, I admit,

5
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,980
looks like the inside of

6
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,460
a ghost's spooky rectum.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,008
And it's been a busy week, with

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,980
the two presidential campaigns

9
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,980
making their final arguments,

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,980
and Jared kushner... Harvard's

11
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,980
shiniest mistake... deciding to

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,980
make this last-ditch appeal to

13
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:48,980
black voters.

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,980
One thing we've seen in a lot

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,980
of the black community,

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,980
which is mostly democrat, is

17
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,980
that President Trump's policies

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,980
are the policies that can help

19
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,980
people break out of the problems

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,980
that they're complaining about,

21
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,988
but he can't want them to be

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,009
successful more than they want

23
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:02,040
to be successful.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, fuck you, Jared.

25
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,980
I guess we should all be

26
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,980
applauding you for wanting

27
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:07,980
to be born to a billionaire

28
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,980
real-estate developer, then

29
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,980
wanting your father to pledge

30
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:11,980
$2.5 million dollars to Harvard

31
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:12,980
not long before you were

32
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,980
admitted, and then for wanting

33
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,980
to marry the daughter of the

34
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,980
world's most successful liar.

35
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:18,980
If only more black fetuses had

36
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,980
your ambition and drive, maybe

37
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:21,980
they'd be as successful as you.

38
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,980
But look, the fact is, the

39
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,980
election is just two days away.

40
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:26,980
And because of that, our show

41
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,980
tonight is going to be a bit

42
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,980
different.

43
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,980
Because instead of having just

44
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,980
one main story, we're actually

45
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:32,980
going to have two, each focusing

46
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,460
on a different aspect of

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
the trump presidency.

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,008
It's the "home alone 2" of.

49
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,980
As it's amplified the

50
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,980
dangers of air travel, lots of

51
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,980
it took place in New York, and

52
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,980
right in the middle, for no good

53
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:51,980
reason, is Donald fucking trump.

54
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,980
And I know that the fact we're

55
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,980
about to talk about this at all,

56
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,980
would make trump roll his eyes.

57
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,980
That's all I hear about now.

58
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,640
Turn on television, "covid,

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,008
covid, covid, covid, covid."

60
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,980
A plane goes down, 500 people

61
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,000
dead, they don't talk about it.

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,980
"Covid, covid, covid, covid."

63
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,980
By the way, on November 4th,

64
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,980
you won't hear about it anymore.

65
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,980
Covid!

66
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,980
Covid!

67
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,980
Believe me, I'd love

68
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,980
nothing more than to not talk

69
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,980
about covid, and instead return

70
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,980
to subjects we'd normally

71
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,980
cover on this show, like

72
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,980
scented candle fraud or alpaca

73
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,980
veterinarian malpractice.

74
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,980
Unfortunately, I can't do that

75
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,980
when so many Americans are still

76
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,980
dying of "covid, covid"

77
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,980
every day.

78
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,980
For many, trump's handling of

79
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,980
the coronavirus is going to be

80
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,980
a significant factor in how they

81
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,980
vote, and to listen to him,

82
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,988
that's really not a problem.

83
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,960
He's labeled his handling of

84
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,980
the pandemic as "tremendous,"

85
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,980
"a-plus," and said "nothing

86
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,980
more could have been done."

87
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,980
Which is obviously ridiculous,

88
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,980
as america has just 4% of

89
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,980
the global population, and yet,

90
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,980
about 20% of global cases.

91
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,980
And if you're thinking, "oh,

92
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,980
come on... who doesn't know

93
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,980
trump fucked up this pandemic?,"

94
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,988
the truth is, a lot of voters

95
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,960
are more than willing to give

96
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,980
him the benefit of the doubt.

97
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,980
How do you feel president

98
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,980
trump has done in handling

99
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,980
the pandemic?

100
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,980
The best he can for something

101
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,980
that's so somewhat unknown.

102
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,980
I think he's probably doing

103
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,980
the best he can right now.

104
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,980
I mean, there is so much mixed

105
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,980
information out there and trying

106
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,980
to decipher what's fact and

107
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,980
what's fiction.

108
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,020
The pandemic?

109
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,980
Not his fault.

110
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,980
And everything that's gone along

111
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,980
with it?

112
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,980
Not his fault.

113
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,980
He's doing the best he can.

114
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,980
Is he?

115
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,980
I guess that depends... do you

116
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,980
mean he's doing the best that

117
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,980
any president can, or the best

118
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,980
that he can?

119
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,880
Because if it's the second one,

120
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,008
you might actually be right.

121
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,980
We should probably all

122
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,980
be grateful he hasn't tried

123
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,980
bottling his urine and selling

124
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,980
it as trump immunity juice.

125
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,520
And look, all presidents,

126
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,960
whoever they are, tend to

127
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
face a defining crisis.

128
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,988
And this was unquestionably

129
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,009
trump's.

130
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,980
But his response been such a

131
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,980
disaster that there are massive

132
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,980
fuckups you may've already

133
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,980
forgotten.

134
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,980
Remember that time he suggested

135
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,980
we should leave American

136
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,980
citizens on a cruise ship

137
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,980
ravaged with coronavirus,

138
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,980
because they'd increase

139
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,980
the number of positive cases in

140
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,980
the country, and he liked the

141
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,980
numbers being where they are?

142
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,980
That was insane, right?

143
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,980
And we covered that on the show.

144
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,988
In fact, we've talked about

145
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,009
coronavirus a lot on the show

146
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:11,980
this year.

147
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,520
But we still thought that

148
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,008
tonight, especially if you, or

149
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,980
someone you know, also thinks

150
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,980
"nothing more could have been

151
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,980
"done," it would be worth taking

152
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,980
a look at three crucial areas

153
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,980
where more could very much have

154
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,980
been done.

155
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,980
Preparation,

156
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,980
coordination, and communication.

157
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,980
And let's start with

158
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,980
preparation.

159
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,980
Because it is worth noting,

160
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,980
previous presidents had been

161
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,980
aware of a threat like this

162
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:34,980
for years.

163
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,980
George w. Bush demanded the

164
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,980
government develop a pandemic

165
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,980
response plan all the way back

166
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,980
in 2005, and Obama created a

167
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,980
pandemic preparedness team,

168
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,980
and gave a speech in December of

169
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,980
2014 that is eerily prescient.

170
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,980
There may and likely will

171
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,980
come a time in which we have

172
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,980
both an airborne disease

173
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,980
that is deadly.

174
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,980
And in order for us to deal with

175
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,980
that effectively, we have to put

176
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,980
in place an infrastructure...

177
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,980
Not just here at home, but

178
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,980
globally... that allows us to

179
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,980
see it quickly, isolate it

180
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,980
quickly, respond to it quickly.

181
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,000
So that if and when a new strain

182
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,980
of flu, like the Spanish flu,

183
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,980
crops up five years from now or

184
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,980
a decade from now, we've made

185
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,980
the investment.

186
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,980
Wow.

187
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,980
Those are some shockingly

188
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,980
specific predictions.

189
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,980
What else did he say there?

190
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,980
"In exactly five years, the

191
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,980
warriors are gonna blow a 3-1

192
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,980
lead to the cavs, and LeBron's

193
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,980
gonna have a chase down block

194
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,980
that makes your soul jump

195
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,980
out of your body.

196
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,980
Also, kumail nanjiani's gonna

197
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,980
get really jacked in a way that

198
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,980
you don't know quite how to feel

199
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,980
about.

200
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,980
So previous presidents were well

201
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,980
aware something like this could

202
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,980
happen.

203
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,980
And yet, in the years before

204
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,980
this outbreak, trump's

205
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,980
administration not only

206
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,980
disbanded Obama's pandemic team,

207
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,980
they also cut CDC staff

208
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,980
operating within China by more

209
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,980
than two-thirds, and ended a

210
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,980
pandemic early warning program.

211
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,820
And even once the pandemic had

212
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,980
begun, trump took an appallingly

213
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,980
long time to take it seriously.

214
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,980
He'll often complain... not

215
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,820
wrongly... that China took too

216
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,008
long to be forthright with us

217
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,980
about the virus.

218
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,980
But what he doesn't mention is

219
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,980
that once we found out about it,

220
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,980
we acted unforgivably slowly.

221
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,980
The first public reports of what

222
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,980
was happening in Wuhan came on

223
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,980
December 31st.

224
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,980
And yet, Alex azar, trump's

225
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,760
secretary of health and human

226
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,008
services, couldn't get a meeting

227
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,980
with trump to talk about it

228
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,980
until January 18.

229
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,980
And even when he did, trump

230
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,980
apparently interrupted him

231
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,980
to ask when flavored vaping

232
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,988
products would be back

233
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,007
on the market.

234
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:34,019
Which, y'know...

235
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,980
Cool.

236
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,980
Then, trump continually implied

237
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,980
that the virus would simply go

238
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,980
away... despite learning on

239
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,980
February 26 that there was

240
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,980
community spread in the u.S.

241
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:46,980
Something we might've known

242
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,700
sooner, had we also not lost

243
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,008
a month due to flaws in our

244
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,980
testing process that we were

245
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,980
extremely slow to fix.

246
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,980
And yet, despite all this, trump

247
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,980
loves to claim that it doesn't

248
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,980
matter what he didn't do... what

249
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,980
really matters is this.

250
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,980
This country is very lucky

251
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,980
and I'm very lucky that I put

252
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,988
the ban on China.

253
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,009
I swiftly implemented a travel

254
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:09,980
ban on China.

255
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,980
I put in the ban on China.

256
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,980
I did the China ban.

257
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,980
We put that ban on.

258
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,980
When I put a ban on.

259
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,980
You have to remember, I put

260
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,980
the ban on China.

261
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,980
Banned travel from China.

262
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,980
We put the ban on China.

263
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,980
I put a ban on China.

264
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,980
Ban on China.

265
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,980
Yeah, to listen to

266
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,980
trump tell it, he banned travel

267
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,980
from China, and job done.

268
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,980
So if you've lost a loved one

269
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,980
to this virus, I've got some

270
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,980
great news... you didn't!

271
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,460
They're completely fine!

272
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,007
They've just been busy

273
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:32,980
jet-setting all across

274
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,980
the world, enjoying live

275
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,980
performances with thousands of

276
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,980
their closest friends, because

277
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,980
trump put the ban on China,

278
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,980
and we're all very lucky he did.

279
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,980
But a few things about that.

280
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,980
Because while he did indeed

281
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,980
impose some travel restrictions

282
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,980
on China, they took effect on

283
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,980
February 2nd... that's two weeks

284
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,980
after the first known case in

285
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,980
the u.S., and also, after 45

286
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,980
other countries had already

287
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,980
done so.

288
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,980
And this "ban" had some major

289
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,980
exceptions... including allowing

290
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,980
u.s. Citizens, residents, and

291
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,980
their immediate family members

292
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,980
to still come into the country

293
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,980
from China... meaning an

294
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,980
additional 40,000 people came

295
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,980
in from there during the first

296
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,980
two months that his ban was

297
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,980
in place.

298
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,980
Also, we now know the virus came

299
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,980
to the New York City area not

300
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,980
from China, but predominantly

301
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,980
via Europe... and yet, it took

302
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:17,980
trump an additional six weeks

303
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,980
to place any restrictions on

304
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,980
travelers from there.

305
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,980
And when he finally did that,

306
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,980
it came in a chaotic oval office

307
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,980
speech where he falsely made it

308
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,980
sound like some Americans

309
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,980
wouldn't be allowed back

310
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,988
into the country.

311
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,960
Which had predictable

312
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
consequences.

313
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,008
Confusion leading to chaos

314
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,980
at u.S. Airports under

315
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,980
the administration's

316
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,980
European travel ban.

317
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,980
Lines stretching for hours in.

318
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,980
New York, Dallas, and Chicago's

319
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,980
O'Hare.

320
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,980
Yeah, those images

321
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,988
don't get any easier to look at.

322
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,960
People panicked by trump's

323
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,960
announcement rushed into

324
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
airports that were not

325
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,980
adequately prepared to safely

326
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,980
process them, with some

327
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,980
passengers reporting there was

328
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,980
no hand sanitizer available,

329
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,980
and having to share pens to fill

330
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,980
out immigration forms.

331
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,980
And this was before most of us

332
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,980
knew we shouldn't be sharing

333
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,980
anything with anyone.

334
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,980
Which, incidentally, is still

335
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,980
true despite what this coke

336
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,980
bottle tells you.

337
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,980
Do not share that coke with

338
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,980
grandma.

339
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,980
Get her her own, and have it

340
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,980
delivered by someone in

341
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,980
a Hazmat suit.

342
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,980
Happy ninetieth, gammy.

343
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,980
Try to stay safe!

344
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,980
So trump's travel ban wasn't

345
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,980
a ban, wasn't early, and didn't

346
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,980
do what he said it did.

347
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,980
But even if he had rolled it out

348
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,980
perfectly, experts will tell

349
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,980
you, if you decide to use travel

350
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,980
restrictions, they have to be

351
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,760
part of a comprehensive plan.

352
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,980
Because the best they can do is

353
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,980
delay a pandemic, not prevent

354
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,980
it.

355
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,980
All they'll do is buy you

356
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,980
a little bit of time,

357
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,980
which is useless if you don't

358
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,980
then use it wisely.

359
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,980
Which brings us to our second

360
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,980
point, coordination.

361
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,980
And I shouldn't have to remind

362
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,980
you just how badly this

363
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,980
administration coordinated

364
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,980
crucial supplies, like ppe.

365
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,980
Some medical professionals

366
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,980
resorted to making their own,

367
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,980
using ski goggles, snorkel

368
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,980
masks, and garbage bags.

369
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,980
And yet, the white house denies

370
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,980
mishandling anything.

371
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,980
The rnc even featured this video

372
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,980
touting the heroism of frontline

373
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,980
workers, including a clip of him

374
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,988
talking to a nurse practitioner

375
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,960
in the oval office, but if you

376
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,988
find the raw footage of that

377
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,007
clip, you will see the

378
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:09,980
conversation they're having

379
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,980
is pretty revealing.

380
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,988
Ppe has been sporadic, but

381
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,007
it's been manageable and we do

382
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:15,980
what we have to do.

383
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,980
Sporadic for you, but not

384
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,980
sporadic for a lot of other

385
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,980
people.

386
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,980
Oh, no, I agree,

387
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,980
Mr. President.

388
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,988
Because I've heard the

389
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,009
opposite.

390
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,980
I heard that they are loaded up

391
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,980
with, with gowns now and...

392
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,988
You know, initially, we had

393
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,007
nothing.

394
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:28,980
We had empty cupboards.

395
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,980
We had empty shelves.

396
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,980
We had nothing because it wasn't

397
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,980
put there by the last

398
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:37,980
administration.

399
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,980
"Sporadic

400
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,980
for you, not sporadic for other

401
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,980
"people" is the literal

402
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,980
definition of sporadic.

403
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,980
His complaint that

404
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,980
he had empty cupboards and

405
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,980
shelves is slightly undercut by

406
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,980
the fact he'd been president

407
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,980
for three years when that

408
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,980
conversation took place.

409
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,980
If you move into a new apartment

410
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,980
and three years later, there's

411
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,980
still nothing in the cupboards,

412
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,980
you don't get to blame

413
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,980
the previous tenant

414
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,980
when you're hungry.

415
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,988
Go buy some fucking food.

416
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,009
And it's not like the

417
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:03,980
administration wasn't warned.

418
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,980
Take Mike Bowen, a top executive

419
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,980
at a ppe production company.

420
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,980
For years, he's been sounding

421
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,980
the alarm that most of

422
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,980
the u.S. Mask supply now comes

423
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,020
from abroad.

424
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,008
And in January, seeing what was

425
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,980
coming our way, he emailed

426
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,980
everyone he could think of in

427
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,980
the government, offering a clear

428
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,980
plan to ramp up production.

429
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,980
I voted for Donald Trump.

430
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,980
I thought, you know, if I

431
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,980
contact enough people in the

432
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,980
administration, somebody, one of

433
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:33,980
these people are going to look

434
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,980
at this and go, "hey, this is

435
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,980
the problem.

436
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,980
Maybe we ought to call this

437
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,988
guy."

438
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,007
And no, I couldn't get any... I

439
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:38,980
didn't get any response there.

440
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,980
Now, in hindsight,

441
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,980
would warning Donald Trump have

442
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,980
done anything?

443
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,980
You'd get into the oval office

444
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,980
and go, "sir, a quarter million

445
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,980
Americans are gonna die!"

446
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,980
And he'd say, "like, me die?

447
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,980
Or just, like, random people?"

448
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,980
And you'd go, "well",

449
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,980
"Herman Cain," and he'd say,

450
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,988
"hmm, not really seeing the

451
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,007
"problem here," and you'd say

452
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:54,980
"it might cost you the election"

453
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,980
and he'd say, "but I'll still

454
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,988
have my fans and rallies,

455
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,007
right?"

456
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:58,980
And you'd say, "of course",

457
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,980
they'll never abandon you even

458
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,988
if you're actively killing

459
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,960
them, " and he'd go, " okay, not

460
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,007
seeing what the warning's about

461
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:02,980
here, please leave, it's time

462
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,988
"for me to watch my shows."

463
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,960
Bowen couldn't have been more

464
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,988
explicit about what needed to

465
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,500
happen.

466
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,988
He told government contacts that

467
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,007
placing large, non-cancelable

468
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:09,980
orders would allow him to ramp

469
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,980
up production immediately,

470
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,980
which was important because...

471
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,980
And I quote... I think we're

472
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,980
in "deep shit."

473
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,980
But the administration dawdled,

474
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,988
and Bowen later testified before

475
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,007
congress about what that delay

476
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:21,980
meant.

477
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,640
I'm getting 500 to 1,000

478
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,980
emails a day.

479
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,980
I'm getting emails from people,

480
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,980
not businesses.

481
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,980
And I am getting emails from

482
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,980
moms.

483
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,980
I'm getting emails from

484
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,980
old people.

485
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,980
"Please, send me masks,"

486
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,980
you make a product that can

487
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,980
protect people.

488
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,980
I can't help these... I can't

489
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,980
help all these people.

490
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,980
Yeah, that must have

491
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,980
been incredibly frustrating.

492
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,980
Because he offered

493
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,980
the administration a clear way

494
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,980
to at least mitigate the damage,

495
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,980
and they didn't move fast enough

496
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,980
and decisions like that meant

497
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,980
that suddenly... and entirely

498
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,988
avoidably... we had to scramble

499
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,009
for essential equipment at the

500
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:02,980
same time as almost everyone

501
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,020
else on earth.

502
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,008
And for all trump's supposed

503
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,980
expertise as a businessman,

504
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,980
his administration's approach to

505
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,980
managing the supply chain

506
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,980
was a total shambles.

507
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,980
At first, trump encouraged

508
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,980
states to "get it themselves"...

509
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,988
Pitting them against each other

510
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,009
and essentially starting a

511
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:18,980
bidding war.

512
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,980
And later, Jared fucking kushner

513
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,980
was made the white house lead

514
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,980
for something called

515
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,980
"the supply chain task force."

516
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,980
At one point, it tried to

517
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,640
coordinate things directly,

518
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,009
with Jared pulling in a group of

519
00:13:28,021 --> 00:13:29,980
mostly young, untrained

520
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,980
volunteers to help vet leads

521
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:31,980
on ppe.

522
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,980
Here's one of them, describing

523
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,980
what happened after an initial

524
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,980
pep talk about the importance of

525
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,980
tracking down equipment.

526
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,980
Everyone stood up and filed

527
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,980
into different offices, and I

528
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,980
remember the only people left

529
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,980
were the volunteers.

530
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,340
We thought we would be

531
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
auxiliary support for an

532
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,980
existing procurement team that

533
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,980
just needed to be expanded as

534
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,980
quickly as possible, and we

535
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,988
would do data entry for

536
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,600
contracts.

537
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,008
And instead, we were the team.

538
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,980
I think when people imagined

539
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,980
the federal government response

540
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,940
in the war room, they thought it

541
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,008
would be this big, you know,

542
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,980
energized group of experts,

543
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:08,980
not ten 20-year-old volunteers.

544
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,988
That really does not

545
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,007
sound good.

546
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:10,980
And I'm not saying young people

547
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,988
are all dumb idiots.

548
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,009
Mozart composed a minuet at age

549
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:14,980
six.

550
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,980
This guy created the downfall of

551
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,980
society at age 19.

552
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,980
You'd just hope that everyone

553
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,980
on the federal task force would

554
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,988
have resource-management

555
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,007
experience that goes beyond

556
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:23,980
"I played "settlers of catan"

557
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,980
at my friend Topher's one night,

558
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,980
"and I actually did pretty well."

559
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,980
And the thing is, one of the

560
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,980
best ways not to run short on

561
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,980
ppe is to not have mass

562
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,980
community spread.

563
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,980
And one of the best ways to

564
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,980
achieve that is by promoting

565
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,980
strong public-health guidelines.

566
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,980
Which brings us to our

567
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,980
final point, communication.

568
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,980
Because trump has repeatedly

569
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,980
undermined public messaging,

570
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,140
from the very start, despite

571
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,980
the fact that... as we now know

572
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,988
he knew extremely early on

573
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,007
just how bad things could get.

574
00:14:59,019 --> 00:14:59,980
You just breathe the air and

575
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,980
that's how it's passed.

576
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,980
And so that's a very tricky one.

577
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,980
That's a very delicate one.

578
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,980
It's also more deadly than your,

579
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,980
you know, your... even your

580
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,980
strenuous flus.

581
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,980
That's what he said

582
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,980
privately, but in public later

583
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,980
that month, he was still

584
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,980
downplaying the severity and

585
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,980
spread of the virus.

586
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,980
This is a flu.

587
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,980
This is like a flu.

588
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah.

589
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,980
Trump just lied,

590
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,980
which I know at this point

591
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,940
isn't something I should have to

592
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,007
say, it seems like the kind of

593
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:24,980
thing we all already know, like

594
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,988
"puppies are good" and "geppetto

595
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,007
definitely built Pinocchio for

596
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:27,988
"weird sex stuff."

597
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,009
That really shouldn't

598
00:15:28,021 --> 00:15:29,980
be a surprise.

599
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,980
If you lived next

600
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,980
door to a bachelor who was aged

601
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,980
somewhere between 70 and 1,000,

602
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,980
whose only friend was a fish,

603
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,400
whose house was full of

604
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,008
not-for-sale, handmade clocks

605
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,980
going off at different times and

606
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,980
one day he said "good news, this"

607
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,980
little wooden boy is Pinocchio,

608
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,980
"he is my son," you'd have.

609
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,988
One...

610
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,009
He's fuckin' that puppet,

611
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:46,980
and two... we have to move.

612
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,980
The guy whose house sounds like

613
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,988
a bomb built himself a son.

614
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,007
We have to move.

615
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:50,980
No judgment.

616
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,980
He fucks that puppet,

617
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,980
it's not a crime.

618
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,980
There's no law written down

619
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,980
anywhere that says geppetto's

620
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,980
not allowed to fuck a puppet

621
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,980
he made while his fish watches.

622
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,980
I'm not calling the cops.

623
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,980
I'm just saying I'm moving away

624
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,980
from geppetto.

625
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,980
And yet, even as it became clear

626
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,980
to everyone that this was very

627
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,980
much more than the flu,

628
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,980
trump constantly undermined

629
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,980
his own administration's advice.

630
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,980
On April 3rd, the CDC finally

631
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,980
advised that the public

632
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,980
wear masks.

633
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,980
But trump immediately undercut

634
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,980
it in the very press conference

635
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,980
that news was announced.

636
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,980
The CDC is advising the use

637
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,980
of non-medical cloth face

638
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,988
covering as an additional

639
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,009
voluntary public health

640
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,988
measure.

641
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,009
So it's voluntary; You don't

642
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:32,980
have to do it.

643
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:33,980
They suggested for a period of

644
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,980
time.

645
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,980
But this is voluntary.

646
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,980
I don't think I'm going to be

647
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,980
doing it.

648
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,988
And just like that,

649
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,009
wearing a mask was a political

650
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:43,980
issue.

651
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,980
Trump himself didn't wear a mask

652
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,980
in public until July, which is

653
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,980
obviously dangerous.

654
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,980
You can't effectively convince

655
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,980
people to do something while

656
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,980
refusing to do it yourself.

657
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,000
It's why soulcycle instructors

658
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,008
are on a bike like everyone

659
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,980
else, instead of just yelling

660
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,980
"pedal faster!"

661
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,980
While lounging on a bean bag and

662
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,760
eating a bucket of hot wings.

663
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's about setting a good

664
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,980
example.

665
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,980
And the thing is,

666
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,980
Americans were listening to him.

667
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,980
Listen to these people

668
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,988
just a few weeks later.

669
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,007
It's just like the flu,

670
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:10,980
right?

671
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,980
Well, it's not just

672
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,980
like the flu.

673
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,988
It's far more contagious.

674
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,960
I mean, well, I know, but

675
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,009
people die from the flu also.

676
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:17,980
And far more deadly.

677
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,980
They do die from the flu.

678
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,980
So to me, that's just the way

679
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,980
I look at it.

680
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,980
I mean, if he's not

681
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,980
wearing a mask,

682
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,988
I'm not gonna wear a mask.

683
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,960
If he's not worried,

684
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,007
I'm not worried.

685
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:25,980
The president?

686
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,980
Yes, sir.

687
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,980
Okay.

688
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,980
I understand that impulse, but

689
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,980
"if he's not worried, I'm not

690
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,980
"worried," is a weird thing to

691
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,988
say when he is the president,

692
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,960
surrounded by 24/7 security and

693
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,980
a team of doctors, and you are

694
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,980
not even surrounded by a shirt.

695
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,980
It's been genuinely remarkable

696
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,980
just how consistently trump has

697
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,980
undercut public-health

698
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,980
messaging.

699
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,980
Over a decade ago, the CDC

700
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,980
actually developed guidelines

701
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,980
for how leaders should

702
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,980
communicate during a crisis.

703
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,160
Be first.

704
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,007
Be right.

705
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:55,980
Be credible.

706
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,980
Express empathy.

707
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,980
Promote action.

708
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:00,980
And show respect.

709
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,980
And I'm not saying the CDC

710
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,980
has been perfect during this

711
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,980
pandemic, but trump did the

712
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:05,980
precise opposite of every single

713
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,980
one of those.

714
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:09,980
And on the empathy one... which

715
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,980
should be the hardest to do

716
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,980
badly, he's been borderline

717
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,980
sociopathic.

718
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:19,980
Because think about what medical

719
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,980
professionals have had to go

720
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,980
through at this year,

721
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,988
especially at the start of this

722
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,007
crisis.

723
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:25,980
In New York, hospitals had giant

724
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,980
refrigerated trucks that served

725
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,980
as makeshift morgues, and there

726
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,980
were mass graves dug on

727
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,980
hart island, even as hospital

728
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,980
workers broke down in video

729
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,980
testimonials.

730
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,980
It was utterly brutal.

731
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,980
And with that in mind, let's go

732
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,980
back to that oval-office meeting

733
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,980
trump had with nurses...

734
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,980
You know,

735
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,980
the one they used in the rnc

736
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,980
video.

737
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,980
Just watch trump respond to

738
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,988
someone citing concerns about

739
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,009
what his colleagues were going

740
00:18:47,021 --> 00:18:48,980
through.

741
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,980
And if I may add, one big

742
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,980
concern that I have is the

743
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,980
post-traumatic trauma that a lot

744
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,980
of the nurses and doctors and

745
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,980
other members of the healthcare

746
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,980
team will be facing in the

747
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,980
future.

748
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,980
You know, they're seeing

749
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,988
death...

750
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,540
A lot.

751
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,007
A lot.

752
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:05,980
Probably three or four times

753
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,980
the average than what they

754
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,988
normally would.

755
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,007
Yeah.

756
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:08,980
It's a lot of death.

757
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,980
Yes.

758
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,980
Yes, sir.

759
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,980
There's no question about it.

760
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,988
And, by the way, while we're

761
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,007
at it, you can pass these pens

762
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:13,980
around, okay?

763
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,980
You can pass them around.

764
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,980
Here you go.

765
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,980
I got some for the other side.

766
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,980
We don't want to forget them,

767
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,980
Marty.

768
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,980
I know, after

769
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,980
four years, it is hard for

770
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,980
anything trump does to shock

771
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,980
you anymore.

772
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,980
But it is worth making sure that

773
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,980
that still does.

774
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,980
That man was in the middle of

775
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,980
talking about his peers' PTSD

776
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,980
and the president cut him off

777
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,988
so he could offer everyone pens.

778
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,009
Pens.

779
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:37,980
He wasn't even listening, he was

780
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,980
just sitting there waiting for

781
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,988
his turn to speak so he could do

782
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,007
his pen thing.

783
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:40,980
Is there anything more grim than

784
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,980
that?

785
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,980
I mean, I guess he could have

786
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,988
not offered them pens.

787
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,960
But would that have been worse?

788
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,007
Better?

789
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:47,980
It's honestly difficult to say.

790
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,980
It's even more difficult to

791
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,980
write a joke off of.

792
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,980
"Oh, trump must be great for you

793
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,980
comedians, right?"

794
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,980
Yeah, not really!

795
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,980
This has been a fucking

796
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,980
nightmare!

797
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,980
And all of this... the lack of

798
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,988
preparation, coordination, and

799
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,009
communication... has had

800
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:02,980
real-world effects.

801
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,980
And I know trump badly wants

802
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:05,980
everyone to believe that nothing

803
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,980
more could have been done.

804
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,980
But that's just not true.

805
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,980
Other countries have done more

806
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,980
and suffered less.

807
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,988
We have four times more people

808
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,009
than Germany, but 17 times

809
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:16,980
the covid cases.

810
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,980
And we have three and a half

811
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,980
times more people than Vietnam,

812
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,880
but 7500 times the covid cases.

813
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
This wasn't inevitable.

814
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,980
And look, I shouldn't have to

815
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,980
take 20 minutes to tell you that

816
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,820
trump mismanaged the pandemic.

817
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,980
In a lot of ways, the answer to

818
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,980
the question, "has trump done a

819
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,980
good job handling this pandemic"

820
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,980
is "well, he got the disease,

821
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:37,980
so, y'know..."

822
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,980
And the thing is, there are

823
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,980
so many more terrible moments

824
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,980
we haven't had time to cover.

825
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,980
From using this racist term

826
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,980
multiple times, to never once

827
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,980
releasing a comprehensive

828
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,980
federal strategy for fighting

829
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,980
covid, to removing a watchdog

830
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,980
overseeing $2 trillion in covid

831
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,980
relief, to saying he asked his

832
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,820
people to slow down testing...

833
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,007
Which his people then tried

834
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:56,980
to pass off as him kidding,

835
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,980
to which he responded,

836
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,980
"I don't kid," to baselessly

837
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,980
claiming that doctors are

838
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,980
inflating coronavirus

839
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:03,980
death counts for money,

840
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,980
to suggesting sunlight and

841
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,980
ingesting disinfectants could

842
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,980
help cure the virus,

843
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,980
to repeatedly undermining

844
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,980
the nation's top infectious

845
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,980
disease expert.

846
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,980
At one point, he retweeted

847
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,000
"fire fauci," and got so openly

848
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,008
jealous of him that when fauci

849
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,980
was invited to throw the opening

850
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,980
pitch at a nationals game,

851
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,980
trump announced he'd be doing

852
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,988
the same for the Yankees,

853
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,960
surprising them, since they'd

854
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,980
not actually invited him.

855
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,820
And look, if biden is elected,

856
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,008
it's not like he's going to

857
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,980
magically end this pandemic,

858
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,980
but he'll at least take it

859
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,980
seriously.

860
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,980
And it's pretty bleak that

861
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,980
that alone sounds good,

862
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,980
but it really does.

863
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,980
Because at this point,

864
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,980
trump is clearly bored of

865
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,980
hearing about covid,

866
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,980
and I am sorry about that.

867
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,980
But you know what's been

868
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,980
completely exhausting

869
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,980
for the rest of us?

870
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,980
Worrying about it all the time.

871
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,980
For what it's worth, multiple

872
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,980
members of our staff were sick

873
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,980
earlier this year, and it was

874
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,980
heart-wrenching being constantly

875
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,988
concerned about their health.

876
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,960
And that concern hasn't gone

877
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
away.

878
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,980
There are long-term and

879
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,700
devastating effects for many

880
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,960
who have recovered that we still

881
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
don't fully understand.

882
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,980
People who are sick and dying

883
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,980
can't see their families.

884
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,980
And cases are now spiking to

885
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,980
record highs all over the

886
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,980
country.

887
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,980
This virus has taken so much

888
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:11,980
from us.

889
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,980
Our peace of mind, our routines,

890
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,980
and nearly a quarter of

891
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,980
a million Americans.

892
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,980
And it's frankly pathetic that

893
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,980
in response, the only things

894
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,980
trump has offered people in this

895
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,980
country over the past eight

896
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,980
months are damaging lies,

897
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,980
staggering incompetence,

898
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,980
and occasionally... when he's

899
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,980
feeling generous... some shitty

900
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,980
fucking pens.

901
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,000
And now, this.

902
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,980
And now...

903
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,980
Our annual look at what

904
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,980
happens when local news and

905
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,980
Halloween collide.

906
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,980
The best way to spread the

907
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,980
studio 10 cheer is by going as

908
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,980
elf for Halloween this year!

909
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,980
Nailed it!

910
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,980
Happy Halloween, y'all!

911
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,980
Happy Halloween.

912
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,980
I am dad.

913
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,980
We are a formal apology.

914
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,988
We are a formal apology.

915
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I am a cactus.

916
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,980
I am a hand sanitizer.

917
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,980
Who's uncle Sam?

918
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,980
Me.

919
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,980
Carole baskin here.

920
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,980
Oh, no, my babies.

921
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,980
She is going to keep us

922
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,988
in check nationwide.

923
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,007
Looking good.

924
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:09,980
There you go, Phoenix.

925
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,980
How's your 'stache?

926
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,988
Did you grow that from

927
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,600
yesterday?

928
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,988
Overnight.

929
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,009
How is the jalapeno?

930
00:23:14,021 --> 00:23:15,980
Amazing.

931
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,980
Stick on.

932
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,980
Welcome, welcome, welcome to

933
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,980
"last week today," I am

934
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,980
John Oliver.

935
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,000
Stamps.

936
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,980
Moving on.

937
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,980
Our first story was

938
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,980
about how trump handles

939
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,980
a crisis, what he does when

940
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,988
the world throws him a

941
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,007
curveball.

942
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:36,980
But our second one is going to

943
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,988
be about how this administration

944
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,007
governs on a day-to-day basis,

945
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:38,980
and importantly, how it could

946
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,980
govern if given a second term.

947
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,980
Because I'd now like to talk

948
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,980
about William barr, trump's.

949
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:44,980
Attorney General, and

950
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,980
constipated charmin bear.

951
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,980
And let's immediately answer the

952
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,980
question that's undoubtedly top.

953
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,980
"Do you have a

954
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,980
clip of him playing the

955
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,980
bagpipes?"

956
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,980
Well, relax.

957
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,000
The answer is yes.

958
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,980
You're welcome.

959
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,980
Now, does that tell us anything

960
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,980
about barr, aside from the fact

961
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,980
that he's the kind of guy who,

962
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:17,980
given the option to learn

963
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,980
literally any musical

964
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,980
instrument, actively chose the

965
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,980
bagpipes, which is basically a

966
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,980
noisy sex doll for octupses?

967
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,980
No, it didn't.

968
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,980
Did we have to show you anyway?

969
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,980
Absolutely.

970
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,980
Because any time we have footage

971
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,980
of the subject of one of our

972
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,980
stories playing the bagpipes,

973
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,980
we will show you a clip of that

974
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,980
happening.

975
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,980
That's not just a promise;

976
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,020
It's a bagpipe promise.

977
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,980
Exactly.

978
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,980
Now, since becoming a.G.,

979
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:39,980
barr has been in the news

980
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,980
constantly, and almost never

981
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,980
for good reasons.

982
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,980
In just the past few months,

983
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,980
he has, among other things,

984
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,980
sown distrust in mail-in voting,

985
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,980
and also dismissed public-health

986
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,980
measures in the middle of a

987
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,980
pandemic in the grossest

988
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,980
possible way.

989
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,980
You know, putting a national

990
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,980
lockdown, stay at home orders is

991
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,980
like house arrest.

992
00:24:59,020 --> 00:24:59,980
It's... you know, other than

993
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,980
slavery, which was a different

994
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,980
kind of restraint, this is the

995
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,980
greatest intrusion on civil

996
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,220
liberties in American history.

997
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,980
Now I know that's

998
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,980
ridiculous for, let's say,

999
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,980
a hundred different reasons,

1000
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,980
but do spare a thought for his

1001
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,980
description of slavery as

1002
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,980
"a different kind of restraint."

1003
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,980
That phrase is doing a lot of

1004
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:23,980
heavy lifting there, much like

1005
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,980
slaves did when... and this is

1006
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,980
true... they were literal

1007
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,980
slaves.

1008
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,980
And what is particularly

1009
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,980
striking about barr's extreme

1010
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:34,980
behavior over the last year and

1011
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,980
a half is that, when trump

1012
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,980
first nominated him, the news

1013
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,980
was basically greeted with

1014
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:38,980
relief.

1015
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,980
Barr will be seen as

1016
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,980
a relatively noncontroversial

1017
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,988
choice, an establishment

1018
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,009
choice.

1019
00:25:42,021 --> 00:25:43,988
William barr is sort of an

1020
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,009
old establishment hand.

1021
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:45,980
He's an institutionalist.

1022
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,980
He's a grown up.

1023
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,980
He's an adult,

1024
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,980
he's a grown up.

1025
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,980
This is someone who is an

1026
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,980
adult in the room.

1027
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,400
I think someone like

1028
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,980
bill barr, who has experience,

1029
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,980
seems like he would be a better

1030
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,980
adult in the room for us.

1031
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,980
"Adult in the room?"

1032
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,980
Look, not only is "being an"

1033
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,980
"adult" an absurdly low bar to

1034
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,980
set for the highest levels of

1035
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,980
government, but it also implies

1036
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,980
that the main problem with trump

1037
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,980
is that he is childish.

1038
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,988
And I know that it makes for

1039
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,009
a fun balloon now and again,

1040
00:26:14,021 --> 00:26:15,980
but at its core, "I wish"

1041
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,980
that white nationalist with

1042
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,980
an authoritarian streak would

1043
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,980
"act his age" is sort of missing

1044
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,980
the point here.

1045
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,980
But you can kind of see why

1046
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,980
people were so willing to

1047
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,980
embrace barr.

1048
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,980
He had previously served as.

1049
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,980
Attorney General under

1050
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,980
George h.W. Bush, so he at least

1051
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,980
knew what the job involved.

1052
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,980
And his two immediate

1053
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,980
predecessors as trump's a.G.

1054
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,980
Were the racist goblin formerly

1055
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,980
known as Jeff sessions, and

1056
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,980
then, for a few crazy months,

1057
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,980
Matthew Whitaker, a man who was

1058
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,980
once embroiled in a scandal over

1059
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,980
a patent company he was involved

1060
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,980
in, whose clients included the

1061
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,980
inventor of a "masculine toilet"

1062
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,980
for the "well-endowed."

1063
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,980
So yeah, by that standard,

1064
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,980
barr was the adult in the room.

1065
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,980
But it's worth remembering,

1066
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,980
some adults are assholes.

1067
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,980
And barr is one of them,

1068
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,980
but he's very much more.

1069
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,980
He's a driven, deeply moralistic

1070
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,980
man with extreme views

1071
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,980
on executive power,

1072
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,980
actually making him one of

1073
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,988
the more dangerous figures

1074
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,007
in the trump administration,

1075
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:08,980
which I know is saying

1076
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,020
something.

1077
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,980
But if trump gets a second term,

1078
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,980
barr is only going to be more

1079
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,980
dangerous going forward.

1080
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,980
So tonight, let's talk about

1081
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,980
bill barr.

1082
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,980
And let's start with the fact

1083
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,980
that, from a very early age,

1084
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,580
he was simply a nightmare.

1085
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,860
Here is his old boss, at barr's

1086
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,008
swearing-in, sharing a fun

1087
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,980
anecdote from his childhood.

1088
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,980
The newspapers report

1089
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,980
bill barr was giving eisenhower

1090
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,980
for president speeches when he

1091
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,980
was in kindergarten.

1092
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,980
And his parents passed along

1093
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,980
the word that young bill was

1094
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,980
discoursing about separation of

1095
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,980
powers before he gave up his

1096
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,980
pacifier.

1097
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,980
What a weird thing to

1098
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,980
share on someone's first day in

1099
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,980
a new job.

1100
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,980
"Hey, everyone, please welcome

1101
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,640
bill... he's from New York,

1102
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,007
and fun fact, as a child,

1103
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:52,980
he was a little narc

1104
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,980
who devoted himself to an

1105
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,980
unhealthy worship of authority

1106
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,580
instead of cultivating any

1107
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,007
meaningful relationships.

1108
00:27:57,019 --> 00:27:57,980
We're so glad to have him on

1109
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,980
"board."

1110
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,980
Veneration of authority has been

1111
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,980
a consistent throughline of

1112
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,980
barr's life.

1113
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,980
At Columbia university in the

1114
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,980
anti-war '60s, he stood out for

1115
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,980
being incredibly

1116
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,980
pro-law-enforcement... so much

1117
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,980
so, that he brought police

1118
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,980
coffee as they encountered

1119
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,980
protesters, and once got into

1120
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,980
a fistfight with students who

1121
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:17,980
were demonstrating on campus,

1122
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,980
a story he told "the New York"

1123
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,980
times " while " letting out a big

1124
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,980
laugh."

1125
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,980
And that is just sad.

1126
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:24,980
You're supposed to tell your

1127
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,980
grandkids fun, inspiring college

1128
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,980
stories about how you burnt your

1129
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,980
draft card or went streaking

1130
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,980
across campus, but barr's wild

1131
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,980
tales seem to be more like,

1132
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,980
"one time, I licked the boot of

1133
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,460
the state so hard, I was

1134
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,008
shittin' aglets for a week.

1135
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,980
"Best four years of my life."

1136
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,980
So it's frankly not surprising

1137
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,980
that, at just age 41, after

1138
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,980
quickly climbing the ranks at

1139
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,980
the d.O.J., barr was picked as

1140
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,980
bush's a.G., and immediately

1141
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,980
made a name for himself

1142
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,980
as an absolute hard-liner on

1143
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,980
immigration, signing off on a

1144
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,980
mass-surveillance program,

1145
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,980
and having a view of criminal

1146
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,980
justice perhaps best summed up

1147
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,980
by a memo his d.O.J. Produced

1148
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,980
titled, "the case for more

1149
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,980
incarceration."

1150
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,980
So he presented himself

1151
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,980
as a strong proponent of

1152
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,980
law and order.

1153
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,980
Don't do the crime, if you can't

1154
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,980
do the time, if bill barr has

1155
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,980
anything to say about it.

1156
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,980
Although interestingly, that

1157
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,980
philosophy had some exceptions

1158
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,880
when it came to his own bosses.

1159
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,980
"New York times" columnist

1160
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,980
William safire, a conservative

1161
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,980
republican, often referred to

1162
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,980
barr then not as.

1163
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,980
Attorney General, but as

1164
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,980
the "cover-up general,"

1165
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,980
suggesting he covered

1166
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,980
up bush's role in Iraq-gate,

1167
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,980
burying the investigation of

1168
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,640
how the bush administration

1169
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
allegedly helped finance

1170
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,980
Saddam Hussein's weapons.

1171
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,980
Yeah.

1172
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,980
That was a major scandal

1173
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,980
at the time, and yet, barr

1174
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,980
refused congress's request to

1175
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,980
appoint an independent counsel.

1176
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:47,980
And not just that... he also

1177
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:48,980
supported the pardon of six

1178
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,980
defendants in the Iran contra

1179
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,980
scandal.

1180
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,980
So his "cover-up general"

1181
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:53,980
nickname is really pretty fair,

1182
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,980
in that it takes something he is.

1183
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,980
Attorney General... and adds

1184
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,980
an apt descriptor.

1185
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,980
The same way Steve mnuchin's

1186
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,980
nickname is secretary sprinkler.

1187
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,980
Why?

1188
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,988
Because he's secretary of

1189
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,960
treasury, and he makes things

1190
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
wet.

1191
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:07,980
Not a dry seat in the house when

1192
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,988
the ole' squirt locker opens his

1193
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,960
hot little mouth.

1194
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You see it, right?

1195
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,980
Everyone definitely sees it.

1196
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,980
And it's not just that barr was

1197
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,980
forgiving of past presidential

1198
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,980
excesses.

1199
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,980
He also worked to expand

1200
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,980
executive power, from advising

1201
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,980
bush that he had the legal

1202
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,980
authority to wage war against

1203
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,980
Iraq without congress' consent,

1204
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,980
to writing a legal opinion that

1205
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,980
said the FBI could seize a

1206
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,980
suspect abroad and return them

1207
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,980
to the u.S. Without first

1208
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:31,980
obtaining the foreign state's

1209
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,980
consent.

1210
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,980
And who'd have thought that just

1211
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,980
30 years later, barr would get

1212
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,980
to work for a man who shared

1213
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,980
his exact views on consent?

1214
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,940
And at this point, it's probably

1215
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,008
worth pausing for a moment to

1216
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,980
talk about the basis for a lot

1217
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,980
of barr's actions.

1218
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,980
Because he is a fervent believer

1219
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,988
in something known as the

1220
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,009
unitary executive theory,

1221
00:30:49,021 --> 00:30:50,980
although he wouldn't like me

1222
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,980
even bringing this up.

1223
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,980
One of the more amusing

1224
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,980
aspects of modern progressive

1225
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,980
polemic is their breathless

1226
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,980
attacks on the "unitary

1227
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,980
executive theory."

1228
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,980
Ahh!

1229
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,980
What are you doing?

1230
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,980
He not only belittled an

1231
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,980
extremely reasonable legal

1232
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,980
concern, he topped it off

1233
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,980
with the "ahhh!" Of a creepy

1234
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,980
uncle trying to interact with

1235
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:21,980
his baby niece who, even though

1236
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,980
she's pre-verbal, already knows

1237
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,980
this guy is bad news.

1238
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,980
But the reason people

1239
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,980
breathlessly attack barr's

1240
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,980
embrace of the unitary executive

1241
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,980
theory is that it takes a lot of

1242
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,980
breath to explain just how wrong

1243
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,980
and dangerous it is.

1244
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,980
Very basically, the theory holds

1245
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,980
that the president has

1246
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,980
virtually complete and

1247
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,980
total executive power,

1248
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,980
and some go further,

1249
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,980
arguing that the mainstream

1250
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,980
understanding of the separation

1251
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,980
of power... that the three

1252
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,980
coequal branches of government

1253
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,980
check and balance each other...

1254
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,980
Is wrong.

1255
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,988
And instead, that each branch

1256
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,960
has near-total authority over

1257
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,980
its own domain.

1258
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,980
But barr goes even further than

1259
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,980
that, once arguing that the only

1260
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,820
checks on the president should

1261
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,008
be through the election process

1262
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,980
or the impeachment process, and

1263
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,980
that is it, which is pretty

1264
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,980
startling, because that

1265
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,980
interpretation gives the

1266
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,980
president an enormous amount of

1267
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,980
leeway.

1268
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,980
Although, as barr tells it,

1269
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,980
George h.W. Bush was a little

1270
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,980
more hesitant, telling him,

1271
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:17,980
"I don't want you stretching,

1272
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,580
I think the way to advance

1273
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,009
executive power is to wait and

1274
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,980
see, move gradually."

1275
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,980
So barr didn't really get

1276
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,980
a chance to fully test his

1277
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,980
belief that the president

1278
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,980
answers to absolutely nobody,

1279
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,980
until, that is, this guy moved

1280
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,980
into the white house.

1281
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,980
And pretty soon, barr seemed

1282
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,980
eager to get back into the game.

1283
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,980
In June 2018, he sent the d.O.J.

1284
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,980
An unsolicited memo criticizing

1285
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,980
the Mueller investigation, which

1286
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,980
is basically a lawyer's version

1287
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,980
of sliding into trump's dms.

1288
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,980
And in it, barr argued that.

1289
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,820
Mueller's core premise... that

1290
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,008
the president acts "corruptly"

1291
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,980
if he attempts to influence

1292
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:50,980
a proceeding in which his own

1293
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,980
conduct is being scrutinized...

1294
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:53,980
Is untenable, because it would

1295
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,980
violate article ii of

1296
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,980
the constitution, which places

1297
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,980
no limits on the president's

1298
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,988
authority to interfere

1299
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,007
with matters that concern

1300
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:02,019
his own conduct.

1301
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Now that is an extreme

1302
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,980
interpretation of the law with

1303
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,980
potentially massive

1304
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,980
implications, and yet, in his

1305
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,980
confirmation hearings, barr went

1306
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,980
to great lengths to make it seem

1307
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,980
palatable.

1308
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,980
At one point, he employed

1309
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,980
one of his signature moves:

1310
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,980
Using boring but smart-sounding

1311
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,980
legalese to cover up a batshit

1312
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,980
proposition.

1313
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,940
He even lectured the panel about

1314
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
what the word "corruptly"

1315
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,980
actually means.

1316
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,980
What it means is, using in

1317
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,980
the 19th century sense, it meant

1318
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,980
to influence in... in a way that

1319
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,980
changes something that's good

1320
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,980
and fit to something that's bad

1321
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,980
and unfit... namely, the

1322
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,980
corruption of evidence or the

1323
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:39,980
corruption of a decision maker.

1324
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,980
That's what the word "corruptly"

1325
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,400
means, because once you

1326
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
dissociate it from that,

1327
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,980
it really means... very hard

1328
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:48,980
to discern what it means.

1329
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,980
It means bad.

1330
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:53,980
What does "bad" mean?

1331
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,980
Uh, bad.

1332
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,980
It means bad.

1333
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,980
Babies and dogs know that.

1334
00:33:59,020 --> 00:33:59,980
But that is almost an impressive

1335
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,980
amount of pseudo-intellectual

1336
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:01,980
nonsense.

1337
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,980
I kind of wanted him to keep

1338
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,980
going.

1339
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,980
"What does "bad" mean?

1340
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,980
What does any word mean?

1341
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,980
Is speech itself not merely

1342
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,980
a collection of sounds, and

1343
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,980
in that sense, specifically

1344
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,980
the 12th century sense, isn't

1345
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:10,980
"bad" simply a noise to which

1346
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,980
we have ascribed meaning?

1347
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:13,980
"Bad" is a human construct,

1348
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,988
but from a purely objective

1349
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,009
standpoint, it has no more

1350
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:17,980
meaning than the sound

1351
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,980
"plorfbor" or "glopnum."

1352
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,980
It's a vocal noise and nothing

1353
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,980
more.

1354
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,980
Anyway, that is why I think

1355
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,980
the president should be allowed

1356
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,980
"to be a tyrant."

1357
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,980
And the thing is, if you strip

1358
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,980
all of that rhetorical bluster

1359
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,980
away, the argument you're

1360
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,980
basically left with is this.

1361
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,988
Article ii allows me to do

1362
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,009
whatever I want.

1363
00:34:33,021 --> 00:34:34,980
It's a thing called

1364
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:35,980
article ii.

1365
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:36,980
Nobody ever mentions

1366
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,980
article ii.

1367
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,988
Then I have an article ii,

1368
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,009
where I have the right to do

1369
00:34:40,021 --> 00:34:42,980
whatever I want as president,

1370
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,988
but I don't even talk about

1371
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,007
that.

1372
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:45,980
That's right.

1373
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,980
He has the right to do whatever

1374
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,980
he wants, but he doesn't even

1375
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:49,980
talk about it.

1376
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:50,980
Which you have to admit

1377
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,980
is pretty cool of him.

1378
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,980
It's what leadership is all

1379
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:53,980
about.

1380
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,980
As Teddy Roosevelt once said,

1381
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,980
"carry a big stick and speak

1382
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,980
loudly about how softly you

1383
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,980
speak about what a big stick

1384
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,980
you're carrying."

1385
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:01,980
And while trump has been

1386
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,980
grumbling lately that barr

1387
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,980
should've done more to punish

1388
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,980
comes to playing defense for

1389
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,980
trump, barr has been relentless.

1390
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,400
He famously provided an

1391
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,960
exculpatory summary of Mueller's

1392
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,008
report weeks before making it

1393
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,980
publicly available.

1394
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:16,980
And since then, his d.O.J. Has

1395
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,980
suggested a lighter sentence for

1396
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,980
Roger stone, is trying to drop

1397
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,980
the charges against

1398
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,980
Michael Flynn... who, remember,

1399
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,980
had pled guilty... removed an

1400
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,980
attorney from office who was

1401
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,980
investigating trump's

1402
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,980
associates, sued John Bolton to

1403
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,980
try and stop the release of his

1404
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,980
book, and at one point, tried to

1405
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,980
have the u.S. Government replace

1406
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,980
trump as the defendant in

1407
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,980
a defamation suit arising from

1408
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,980
trump's statement that a woman

1409
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,980
who had accused him of rape was

1410
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,980
"not my type."

1411
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:42,980
All of which is definitely what

1412
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,980
the founders had in mind when

1413
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:45,980
they drafted article ii.

1414
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,980
So you can see why some have

1415
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,980
argued that barr is trump's

1416
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,980
dream a.G.

1417
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,980
But more interestingly,

1418
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,980
trump may also be barr's dream

1419
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,980
president, someone who is

1420
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,980
the ideal vessel for barr's

1421
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,980
decades-long pursuit of

1422
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,980
a unitary executive.

1423
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,980
And not just that... because

1424
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,980
trump may also give barr

1425
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,980
a chance to push his

1426
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,980
uncompromising moral vision

1427
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,980
onto the rest of the country.

1428
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,520
And it is uncompromising.

1429
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,008
Barr blames what he sees as

1430
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,980
society's ills on moral decay.

1431
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,980
He once said, in an attack on

1432
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,980
the liberalism of the '60s,

1433
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,980
"we see around us the grim

1434
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,980
harvest of the permissive.

1435
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,980
Broken homes,

1436
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,980
fatherless children,

1437
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,980
widespread drug addiction,

1438
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,980
teenage pregnancy, over a

1439
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,520
million abortions a year,

1440
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,980
"crack babies, and drug wars."

1441
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,980
And time has not moderated his

1442
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,980
views, especially when it comes

1443
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,980
to criminal justice.

1444
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,980
When protests erupted

1445
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,980
this summer in the wake of

1446
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:39,980
George Floyd's murder,

1447
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,980
he repeatedly said that

1448
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:41,980
systemic racism in

1449
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,980
police departments

1450
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,980
does not exist.

1451
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,980
And late last year, seemed to

1452
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:47,980
threaten communities who even

1453
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,460
dared to protest against

1454
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
the police.

1455
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,980
They have to start showing,

1456
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,980
more than they do, the respect

1457
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,980
and support that law enforcement

1458
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,980
deserves.

1459
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,980
And if communities don't give

1460
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,980
that support and respect, they

1461
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,980
might find themselves without

1462
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:05,980
the police protection they

1463
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,980
need.

1464
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:08,980
Yeah, that's not how it

1465
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,980
should work, bill.

1466
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,980
A community shouldn't earn

1467
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,980
protection by respecting

1468
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:13,980
the police.

1469
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,980
Police should earn respect by

1470
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,980
protecting the community.

1471
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,980
Because one, they work for us.

1472
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,980
And two, they work for us!

1473
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,980
At his core, barr is clearly

1474
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,980
the same kid who took so much

1475
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,980
joy in beating up protestors at

1476
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,980
Columbia, only now he has the

1477
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,980
force of the federal government

1478
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,980
at his disposal.

1479
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,980
And he has been willing to

1480
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,980
use it.

1481
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,980
Police forcibly removing

1482
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,980
demonstrators Monday to clear a

1483
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,980
path for President Trump to walk

1484
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:40,980
to Saint John's church, damaged

1485
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,980
by arson, for a photo op that

1486
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,980
sparked outrage.

1487
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,980
The a.G. Was there, too, and

1488
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,980
the trump administration says

1489
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,980
he gave the order to increase

1490
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,980
the secure perimeter around

1491
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,980
the white house.

1492
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,980
But now barr says it was not his

1493
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:54,980
call to use aggressive measures.

1494
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,988
"I'm not involved in giving

1495
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,960
tactical commands like that,"

1496
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,008
he told the associated press.

1497
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,980
Adding, his attitude was,

1498
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,980
"get it done," but he didn't

1499
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,000
say, "go do it."

1500
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Okay, that is clearly

1501
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,980
unbelievably weaselly,

1502
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,988
but I will say, I'm glad that

1503
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,007
someone finally found the

1504
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:10,980
perfect words to describe

1505
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:11,980
the role I believe the queen

1506
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,980
played in Diana's death.

1507
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,980
Maybe she didn't say "go do it,"

1508
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,980
but her attitude was definitely

1509
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,980
"get it done."

1510
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,980
But regardless of whether that

1511
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:21,980
operation was a result of barr's

1512
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,980
direct orders or just his

1513
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,980
general attitude, he made his

1514
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,980
support for it afterwards very

1515
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,020
clear.

1516
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,007
Here's what the media is

1517
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:28,980
missing.

1518
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,980
This was not an operation

1519
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:31,980
to respond to that particular

1520
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:32,980
crowd.

1521
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,980
It was an operation to

1522
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,988
move the perimeter one block.

1523
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,960
And the methods they used,

1524
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,988
you think, were appropriate.

1525
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,007
Is that what you're saying?

1526
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:39,980
When they met resistance,

1527
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,020
yes.

1528
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,008
They announced three times.

1529
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,040
They didn't move.

1530
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,007
By the way, there was

1531
00:38:45,019 --> 00:38:45,980
no tear gas used.

1532
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,980
There were chemical

1533
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,980
irritants, the park police

1534
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:48,980
has said.

1535
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,988
No, there were not chemical

1536
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,600
irritants.

1537
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,007
Pepper spray is not a chemical

1538
00:38:51,019 --> 00:38:51,980
irritant.

1539
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:52,980
It's not chemical.

1540
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,980
Pepper spray, you're saying,

1541
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,988
is what was used?

1542
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,009
Pepper balls.

1543
00:38:55,021 --> 00:38:56,980
Pepper balls.

1544
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,980
Okay, he is clearly

1545
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,980
splitting hairs with the word

1546
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:00,980
"chemical" there, but he's also

1547
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,980
entirely fucking wrong!

1548
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:06,000
Pepper balls are made with a

1549
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,008
chemical irritant, you can just

1550
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,980
check the website of the company

1551
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,980
that supplied them to the

1552
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,980
federal government, which

1553
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,980
says that they're made with a

1554
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:13,980
chemical irritant that provides

1555
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,980
"versatility for any situation."

1556
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,980
Because that is what we're all

1557
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,980
looking for in our projectile

1558
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,980
weapons, versatility.

1559
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,820
A way to transition this civil

1560
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
violation from day to night, and

1561
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,008
the answer is, as always, add a

1562
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,980
statement lip, ditch the blazer,

1563
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,980
and change those flats to pumps,

1564
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,980
it's thirsty Thursday, bitches,

1565
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,980
time to pep, pep, pep it up.

1566
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,980
But he has gone even further

1567
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,940
than sanctioning "pepper balls,"

1568
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,008
telling federal prosecutors to

1569
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,980
consider charging rioters with

1570
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,980
sedition, a charge that can

1571
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,980
carry a 20-year prison sentence.

1572
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,980
And then there was this.

1573
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,980
Attorney General William barr

1574
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,980
specifically pointed out

1575
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,980
Seattle, Portland, and.

1576
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,340
New York City as being

1577
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
designated anarchist

1578
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,940
jurisdictions and are at risk of

1579
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
losing federal money.

1580
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,980
It's true.

1581
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,980
The d.O.J.

1582
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,980
Identified Seattle, Portland,

1583
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,980
and New York as anarchist

1584
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,980
jurisdictions, because they were

1585
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:06,980
"permitting violence and

1586
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:07,980
"destruction of property," with

1587
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,880
barr saying, "the safety of the

1588
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,008
citizenry hangs in the balance."

1589
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,220
And protests against

1590
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,008
police brutality in black and

1591
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,980
brown communities, during an

1592
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,460
economic downturn caused

1593
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,008
by a mismanaged pandemic that

1594
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,980
has disproportionately ravaged

1595
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,980
those same communities isn't

1596
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,980
anarchy, it's well-targeted,

1597
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,980
fully justified fury at... to

1598
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,700
borrow a phrase... a lack of

1599
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,980
safety for the citizenry.

1600
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,980
Let's put it this way,

1601
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,980
if there is ever real anarchy,

1602
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,980
it won't be poor people getting

1603
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:34,980
shot.

1604
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,980
Now those threats are likely

1605
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:37,980
meaningless, since congress,

1606
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,980
not the president, has the power

1607
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,980
to determine how federal funds

1608
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,980
are spent.

1609
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:42,980
But that is clearly

1610
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:43,980
not the point here.

1611
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,980
The point is that by barr even

1612
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,980
saying that, he is bolstering

1613
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:48,980
his and the president's case

1614
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,980
that a moral order must be

1615
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,340
imposed, and by force.

1616
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,008
And ultimately, that is why

1617
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,980
he is so very, very dangerous.

1618
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,980
He gives radically conservative

1619
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,980
views the veneer of seasoned

1620
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,980
legal analysis, delivering utter

1621
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:04,980
nonsense while hiding behind

1622
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,980
whoopi goldberg glasses.

1623
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,980
And as much as he may think that

1624
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,980
he's the only objective,

1625
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,980
fair-minded man left in

1626
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:11,980
government, barr has made it

1627
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:12,980
very clear what battle he is

1628
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,980
really fighting, and who he is

1629
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,000
fighting it against.

1630
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,980
The left wants power because

1631
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,980
that is essentially their state

1632
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,980
of grace and their... their

1633
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,980
secular religion.

1634
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,980
They want to run people's lives

1635
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:27,980
so they can design utopia for

1636
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,980
all of us.

1637
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:31,980
And that's what, you know,

1638
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:32,980
that's what turns them on.

1639
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,640
Oh, come on, bill.

1640
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
That's just ridiculous.

1641
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,980
We all know there's only one

1642
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,980
thing that turns on the left,

1643
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,980
and that is Wallace Shawn.

1644
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:41,980
He's a socialist, as if he

1645
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,980
needed to get any hotter.

1646
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:45,980
Redistribute my assets,

1647
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:46,980
you glistening gnome.

1648
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:47,980
Nationalize my healthcare,

1649
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:51,980
you soft-boiled egg.

1650
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:52,980
Barr isn't just fighting to

1651
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,980
give the president power on

1652
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:55,980
principle.

1653
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,980
He wants to give this president

1654
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,880
power so he will use it against

1655
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,007
the people barr thinks are

1656
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:00,980
ruining society.

1657
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,980
Coincidentally, the same people

1658
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,988
that republican politicians have

1659
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,009
blamed for exactly that since

1660
00:42:05,021 --> 00:42:06,980
barr was beating up hippies and

1661
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,340
giving coffee to cops.

1662
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,008
Barr sees a country that needs

1663
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,980
to be whipped into shape and is

1664
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,980
doing everything he can to make

1665
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:14,980
sure that this president can

1666
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,980
whip freely.

1667
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,980
And if trump is reelected, and

1668
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:19,980
barr is given a chance to keep

1669
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,980
serving what he views as a

1670
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:22,980
one-man executive branch that

1671
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,980
has the fucking supreme court

1672
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,880
on its side, then there is only

1673
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,008
one way to breathlessly describe

1674
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:28,980
that.

1675
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,980
Ahhh!

1676
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,980
Yeah, no shit.

1677
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,020
And now this.

1678
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,980
And now...

1679
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,980
Public officials preparing

1680
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,980
children for a covid Halloween.

1681
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:49,000
Hello, kids.

1682
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,007
It is me, your friend, the

1683
00:42:50,019 --> 00:42:50,980
count.

1684
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:51,980
The COVID-19 pandemic is

1685
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:52,980
reshaping how oregonians shape

1686
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,980
holidays.

1687
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:54,980
And that includes Halloween.

1688
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:55,980
But it didn't mean Halloween

1689
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:56,980
can't still be spooky and fun

1690
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:57,980
this year.

1691
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:58,980
Kids are itching to get their

1692
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,980
costumes on and rustle up some

1693
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:01,980
grade-a scares.

1694
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,980
The centers for disease

1695
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,980
control and prevention and the

1696
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:06,980
Virginia department of health

1697
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:07,980
warn against the typical

1698
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,880
door-to-door trick-or-treating.

1699
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,008
Avoid spreading COVID-19 by

1700
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:11,980
doing activities at home with

1701
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,980
your family and friends.

1702
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,220
For those who are

1703
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,008
participating, please follow

1704
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,980
the CDC guidelines and

1705
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:19,980
recommendations.

1706
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:20,980
Wear a mask.

1707
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:21,980
Watch your distance.

1708
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,980
Wash your hands.

1709
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,980
And stay home if you are sick.

1710
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,980
If we all don't do our part,

1711
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,980
the covid virus will get you,

1712
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:30,980
my pretty, and your little dog,

1713
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,020
too.

1714
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:51,980
That's it.

1715
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:56,980
That's our show.

1716
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,980
Look, I don't need to tell you

1717
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,980
just how important Tuesday is.

1718
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:01,980
If you have not voted already,

1719
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:02,980
please, please do so.

1720
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:03,980
I did.

1721
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:04,980
I voted in my first

1722
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:05,980
presidential election

1723
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:06,980
just this morning.

1724
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:07,980
And for what it's worth,

1725
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:08,980
it was inspiring,

1726
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:09,980
unexpectedly moving,

1727
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:15,980
and I did get this free sticker.

1728
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,988
So that's just not nothing.

1729
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,009
Thank you so much for watching

1730
00:44:18,021 --> 00:44:20,980
the show.

1731
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,980
And we will see you next week.

1732
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:23,980
And truly hope we'll all be

1733
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:24,980
feeling at least slightly

1734
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:25,980
better.

1735
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,988
And now, to play us out,

1736
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,007
I give you Attorney General

1737
00:44:27,019 --> 00:44:27,980
bill barr and his fucking

1738
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:28,980
bagpipes.

1739
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,000
Good night.
