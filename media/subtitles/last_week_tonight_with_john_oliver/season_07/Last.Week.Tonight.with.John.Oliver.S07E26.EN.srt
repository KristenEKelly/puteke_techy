1
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,980
HI THERE.

2
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,980
WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

3
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:34,980
STILL TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK

4
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,980
VOID, MADE POSSIBLE THANKS TO

5
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,980
MILK.

6
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:38,980
JUST USE THE CODE "SLURP SLURP

7
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:39,980
JOHN OLLY'S COW JUICE" AT YOUR

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,980
LOCAL CHECKOUT THE NEXT TIME

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:41,976
YOU PURCHASE MILK.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,980
YOU WON'T RECEIVE A DISCOUNT,
BUT YOU WILL RECEIVE MILK.

11
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,980
AND LOOK, IT'S BEEN ANOTHER

12
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:47,980
BUSY WEEK, FROM COVID CASES

13
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:48,980
SPIKING IN THE U.S.,

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,980
TO BRAZILIAN POLICE ALLEGEDLY

15
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,980
CATCHING A SENATOR THERE WITH

16
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,980
CASH BETWEEN HIS BUTT CHEEKS,

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,980
TO CONFIRMATION HEARINGS FOR

18
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,980
AMY CONEY BARRETT.

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,980
THEY INCLUDED TWO FULL DAYS OF

20
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,980
QUESTIONS AND NON-ANSWERS, BEST

21
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:00,980
SUMMED UP BY THIS EXCHANGE.

22
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,980
YOU KNOW, MOST OF US HAVE

23
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,980
MULTIPLE NOTEBOOKS AND NOTES

24
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:05,980
AND BOOKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT

25
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,020
IN FRONT OF US.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,960
CAN YOU HOLD UP WHAT YOU'VE BEEN

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,980
REFERRING TO IN ANSWERING OUR
QUESTIONS?

28
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,000
IS THERE ANYTHING ON IT?

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,980
THE LETTERHEAD THAT SAYS

30
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,980
"UNITED STATES SENATE."

31
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,980
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

32
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,980
EXCEPT, NO, IT ISN'T.

33
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,976
IT'S REALLY NOT IMPRESSIVE AT

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,980
ALL.
PARTLY BECAUSE IT'S EMBLEMATIC

35
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,976
OF THE FACT SHE DODGED ALMOST

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,960
EVERYTHING SHE WAS ASKED,

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,980
AND PARTLY BECAUSE THIS WHOLE
HEARING WAS PRE-ORDAINED

38
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,980
BY THE REPUBLICANS.
THAT PAD COULD'VE CONTAINED

39
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,980
A DRAWING OF A MUSCULAR,

40
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,980
ANATOMICALLY-CORRECT GARFIELD,

41
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,980
AND THEY'D STILL HAVE ALL SAID,

42
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,980
"THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

43
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:41,980
IT'S A YES FROM ME."

44
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,980
BUT ALTHOUGH BARRETT WAS

45
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,980
EVASIVE, THERE WERE STILL

46
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,976
TELLING MOMENTS, LIKE HER

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,980
REFUSING TO SAY SHE ACCEPTS
CLIMATE CHANGE AS A SCIENTIFIC

48
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,980
FACT, ARGUING THAT ROE V. WADE

49
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,980
IS NOT A "SUPER-PRECEDENT,"

50
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,820
AND REFERRING TO GAY PEOPLE AS

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,980
HAVING A "SEXUAL PREFERENCE,"

52
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,980
RATHER THAN ORIENTATION.

53
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,980
WHICH IS JUST RIDICULOUS,

54
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,976
BECAUSE IT'S CLEARLY NOT A

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,660
PREFERENCE.

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,980
NO ONE JUST CHOOSES TO BE
ATTRACTED TO THE SAME SEX,

57
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,980
OR A DIFFERENT SEX,

58
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,980
OR TO ADAM DRIVER.

59
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,980
WE ALL SIMPLY ARE.

60
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,980
DISLOCATE MY ANKLES,

61
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,980
YOU RUSTY CELLO.

62
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,980
TIE MY FINGERS IN A SQUARE KNOT,

63
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,980
YOU EMOTIONALLY-UNAVAILABLE

64
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,980
WATER TOWER.

65
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,980
AND THE SUPREME COURT HEARINGS

66
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,980
WEREN'T THE ONLY

67
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,980
QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSIONS

68
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,980
THIS WEEK.

69
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,980
TRUMP AND BIDEN HELD DUELING

70
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,980
TOWN HALLS ON THURSDAY.

71
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,980
ORIGINALLY, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO

72
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,980
BE A DEBATE BETWEEN THE TWO,

73
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,980
BUT AFTER TRUMP PULLED OUT,

74
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,980
NBC REWARDED HIM WITH AN HOUR

75
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,980
OF TV ALL TO HIMSELF, SOMETHING

76
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,980
WHICH IS, IF NOTHING ELSE,

77
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,980
VERY MUCH ON-BRAND FOR THEM.

78
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,980
AND TRUMP'S HIGH POINT OF

79
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,976
THE NIGHT WAS PROBABLY THIS.

80
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,960
I HAVE TO SAY, YOU HAVE

81
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,980
A GREAT SMILE.

82
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,980
THANK YOU.

83
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,980
THANK YOU.

84
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,976
HE DOES.

85
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,980
YOU'RE SO HANDSOME
WHEN YOU SMILE.

86
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,980
IS HE?

87
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,980
IS HE REALLY?

88
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,976
I'M NOT QUITE SO SURE ABOUT

89
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,980
THAT. UNLESS BY "HANDSOME,"

90
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,980
YOU MEAN "LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE

91
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,980
DROPPED THEIR DENTURES IN A

92
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,980
JACK-O-LANTERN ON

93
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,980
NOVEMBER 14TH," IN WHICH CASE,

94
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,980
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

95
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,980
THE MAN'S GOT A SMILE THAT CAN

96
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,980
LIGHT UP A CROSS.

97
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,980
ALTHOUGH AS HIGH POINTS WENT,

98
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,980
THAT WAS BASICALLY IT FOR

99
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,980
THE PRESIDENT.

100
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,980
EVEN THAT MOMENT TURNED FAST.

101
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,980
JUST WATCH WHAT HAPPENED

102
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,980
IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS.

103
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,980
YOU'RE SO HANDSOME WHEN YOU

104
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,980
SMILE.

105
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,980
AS THE DAUGHTER OF IMMIGRANTS TO

106
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,980
THE UNITED STATES WHO FLED

107
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,980
EASTERN EUROPE DUE TO RELIGIOUS

108
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,980
PERSECUTION, THE UNITED STATES

109
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,980
IMMIGRATION POLICIES ARE VERY

110
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,980
PERSONAL FOR ME.

111
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,980
IF YOU ARE ELECTED TO A SECOND

112
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,980
TERM, DO YOU EXPECT TO PURSUE

113
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,980
YOUR PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO CUT

114
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,980
THE DACA PROGRAM?

115
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,980
WOW.

116
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,980
THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE

117
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,980
THE PERFECT WAY TO ASK TRUMP

118
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,980
A QUESTION.

119
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,980
"YOU HAVE A LOVELY SMILE.

120
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,976
ANYWAY, YOU'D HAVE DOOMED

121
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,980
MY ANCESTORS TO DIE
IN THE HOLOCAUST.

122
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,980
WHY?"

123
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,980
TRUMP'S TOWN HALL, LIKE HIS

124
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,000
ENTIRE CAMPAIGN, WAS EXTREMELY

125
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,996
LIGHT ON POLICY DETAILS.
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T LIKE TO TALK

126
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,980
IN SPECIFICS ABOUT WHAT A SECOND

127
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,980
TRUMP TERM WOULD MEAN.

128
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,980
HE'S MADE VERY FEW CONCRETE

129
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,980
PROMISES, OTHER THAN, "I WILL

130
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,976
NOT LEAVE, I WILL NOT DIE,"

131
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,980
AND, "I WILL GIVE YOU COVID
PERSONALLY."

132
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,980
BUT TONIGHT, I'D LIKE TO TALK

133
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,980
ABOUT SOMETHING INCREDIBLY

134
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,980
IMPORTANT THAT HINGES

135
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,980
ON THIS ELECTION.

136
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,980
BECAUSE OUR MAIN STORY CONCERNS

137
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,980
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION,

138
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,980
OR W.H.O.

139
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,980
YOU MAY ALREADY BE AWARE OF IT

140
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,980
IN ITS ROLE AS ONE OF THE

141
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,980
PRESIDENT'S FAVORITE PUNCHING

142
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,980
BAGS.

143
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,980
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION

144
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,980
SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF

145
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,980
THEMSELVES.

146
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,280
I'M NOT HAPPY WITH

147
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,980
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION.
THEY'RE A PUPPET OF CHINA.

148
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,980
THEY'RE CHINA-CENTRIC,

149
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,976
TO PUT IT NICER.

150
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,980
THEY'RE LITERALLY A PIPE
ORGAN FOR CHINA.

151
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,980
THAT'S THE WAY I VIEW IT.

152
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,980
OKAY, THE W.H.O. IS

153
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,980
NOT LITERALLY A PIPE ORGAN FOR

154
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,980
CHINA, BECAUSE THE ONLY THING

155
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,980
THAT IS LITERALLY A PIPE ORGAN

156
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,980
FOR CHINA IS A PIPE ORGAN.

157
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:46,980
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE WORD

158
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,980
"LITERALLY" MEANS.

159
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,980
OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS,

160
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,980
TRUMP HAS CONSISTENTLY TRIED TO

161
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,980
DEFLECT BLAME FOR HIS HANDLING

162
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,980
OF THE CORONAVIRUS ONTO THE

163
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,980
W.H.O., CHINA, AND THE CLOSE

164
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,980
RELATIONSHIP HE CLAIMS

165
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,020
THE TWO HAVE.

166
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,980
AND AT THE BEGINNING OF JULY,

167
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,980
HE TURNED THAT CRITICISM INTO

168
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,980
REAL ACTION.

169
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,980
IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC,

170
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,980
DONALD TRUMP IS FORMALLY PULLING

171
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,980
OUT OF THE WORLD HEALTH

172
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,980
ORGANIZATION.

173
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,980
WE WILL BE TODAY TERMINATING

174
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,980
OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WORLD

175
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,980
HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND

176
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,980
REDIRECTING THOSE FUNDS TO OTHER

177
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,980
WORLDWIDE AND DESERVING URGENT

178
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:24,980
GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS.

179
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,980
NOW, THAT IS VERY BAD

180
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,980
NEWS, BUT DO SPARE A THOUGHT

181
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,980
FOR MELANIA, WHO MUST'VE HEARD

182
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,976
THE SENTENCE, "WE WILL BE TODAY

183
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,980
TERMINATING OUR RELATIONSHIP,"
AND, FOR THE BRIEFEST OF

184
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,980
MOMENTS, FELT HOPE.

185
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,980
EXCEPT, I'M TOTALLY KIDDING,

186
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,980
SPARE NO THOUGHTS FOR HER...

187
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,980
SHE'S NOT A BABY.

188
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,980
SHE'S TOTALLY COMPLICIT,

189
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,976
AND NEVER FORGET THAT SHE ONCE

190
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,976
SAID, "WHO GIVES A FUCK ABOUT
CHRISTMAS STUFF AND

191
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,976
DECORATIONS?," AN ATTITUDE
FULLY PRESENT IN HER HOLIDAY

192
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,980
THEME, BEST DESCRIBED AS,
"WHAT IF TREES GOT PERIODS

193
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,980
AND HATED YOU?"

194
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,980
THE POINT IS, IN THE MIDST OF

195
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,980
EVERYTHING WE'RE GOING THROUGH

196
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,980
RIGHT NOW, TRUMP HAS DECIDED TO

197
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,980
WITHDRAW THE UNITED STATES FROM

198
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,980
THE W.H.O.

199
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,980
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "SURELY,

200
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,980
HE CAN'T DO THAT, RIGHT?"

201
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:04,980
THE GOOD NEWS IS, THE W.H.O.'S

202
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,980
CONSTITUTION DOESN'T INCLUDE ANY

203
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,980
PROVISIONS FOR MEMBERS TO

204
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,980
WITHDRAW.

205
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,976
THE BAD NEWS IS, THERE IS

206
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,960
EXACTLY ONE EXCEPTION TO THAT

207
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,980
RULE AND IF THE UNITED STATES,

208
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,980
WHICH PASSED A RESOLUTION

209
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,980
DECADES AGO SPECIFYING WE

210
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,976
ACTUALLY CAN WITHDRAW AFTER

211
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,980
GIVING ONE YEAR'S NOTICE.
AND THAT'S A PRETTY WEIRD PERK

212
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,980
FOR AMERICA ALONE TO HAVE.

213
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,980
IT'S LIKE FINDING OUT WE

214
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,980
DEMANDED TO BE THE ONLY COUNTRY

215
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,980
ALLOWED TO WAX THE PUBES OF

216
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,980
EVERY SQUIRREL.

217
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,980
WHY WOULD WE WANT THE RIGHT TO

218
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,980
DO THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE?

219
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,980
AND MORE TO THE POINT,

220
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,980
WHY WOULD WE EVER CONSIDER

221
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:34,980
ACTUALLY DOING IT?

222
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,980
AND THE THING IS, TRUMP IS NOT

223
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,980
BLUFFING.

224
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,980
HE'S ALREADY SUBMITTED A NOTICE

225
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,980
OF WITHDRAWAL TO THE U.N.

226
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,980
TO TAKE EFFECT NEXT JULY,

227
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,980
SO THE CLOCK IS TICKING.

228
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,980
AND GIVEN THAT WE'RE NOW ON

229
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,980
TRACK TO LEAVE THE W.H.O. IN

230
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,980
LESS THAN A YEAR, TONIGHT, LET'S

231
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,980
TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT ACTUALLY

232
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,980
MEANS... HOW IMPORTANT THE

233
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,980
W.H.O.'S WORK IS, HOW VALID

234
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,980
CRITICISMS OF IT ARE, AND WHAT

235
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,980
WE MIGHT BE PUTTING AT STAKE.

236
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,980
AND LET'S START WITH WHAT

237
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,980
THE W.H.O. DOES.

238
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,980
IT WAS FOUNDED IN 1948 AND HAS

239
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,980
SINCE GROWN TO 194 MEMBER STATES

240
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,980
...THAT'S NEARLY EVERY COUNTRY

241
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,980
ON EARTH.

242
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,980
AND VERY BROADLY, IT COORDINATES

243
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,980
GLOBAL RESPONSES TO A WIDE RANGE

244
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,980
OF HEALTH ISSUES, INCLUDING

245
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,980
ALERTING THE WORLD TO THREATS,

246
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,980
FIGHTING DISEASES, DEVELOPING

247
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,980
POLICY, AND IMPROVING ACCESS TO

248
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,980
CARE.

249
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,980
ONE OF THE BIGGEST POWERS IT HAS

250
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,980
IS THE ABILITY TO DECLARE

251
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,980
A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY OF

252
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,980
INTERNATIONAL CONCERN AND ISSUE

253
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,980
RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW COUNTRIES

254
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,980
SHOULD RESPOND.

255
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,980
BUT... AND THIS IS REALLY

256
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,980
IMPORTANT... IT HAS ABSOLUTELY

257
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,980
NO POWER ON ITS OWN TO ENFORCE

258
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,980
THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS.

259
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:34,980
IT CAN ONLY ACT WITHIN A COUNTRY

260
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,980
TO THE EXTENT THAT COUNTRY

261
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,980
ALLOWS IT TO.

262
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,340
AND YET, DESPITE THOSE

263
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,980
SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS,

264
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,980
IT'S MANAGED TO DO SOME

265
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,980
INCREDIBLE THINGS IN THE PAST,

266
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,980
WITH PERHAPS ITS MOST NOTABLE

267
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,160
SUCCESS BEING THIS.

268
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,976
TODAY, A SUBSTANTIAL

269
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,960
MILESTONE IN HUMAN HISTORY.

270
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,980
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION

271
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,980
SAYS SMALLPOX HAS NOW BEEN WIPED

272
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,980
OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND

273
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,980
WILL NEVER RETURN.

274
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,980
IT SAYS IT'LL NEVER RETURN

275
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,980
BECAUSE SMALLPOX CAN ONLY BE

276
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,980
CAUGHT FROM ANOTHER PERSON,

277
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,976
AND IF NO OTHER PERSON HAS IT,

278
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,980
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO CATCH
IT.

279
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,000
IT'S TRUE.

280
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,980
THE W.H.O. COMPLETELY ERADICATED

281
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,980
SMALLPOX, WHICH KILLED

282
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,980
300 MILLION PEOPLE

283
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,980
IN THE 20TH CENTURY ALONE.

284
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,980
IN THE SPACE OF A DECADE,

285
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,980
IT TOOK SMALLPOX FROM 10 MILLION

286
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,980
CASES AND 2 MILLION DEATHS A

287
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,980
YEAR ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ZERO.

288
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,980
AND IT'S AMAZING THAT SOMETHING

289
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,980
CAN GO FROM BEING THAT

290
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,980
WIDESPREAD TO COMPLETELY

291
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,000
DISAPPEARING WITHIN A FEW YEARS.

292
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,980
SMALLPOX IS BASICALLY THE

293
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,980
CIRCUIT CITY OF INFECTIOUS

294
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,980
DISEASES.

295
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,980
AND IT'S EQUALLY AS MISSED.

296
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,980
AND IT'S NOT LIKE THE W.H.O. DID

297
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,980
THIS WITH A MAGIC WAND; IT TOOK

298
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,980
A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK.

299
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,980
NOT ONLY DID THEY HAVE TO

300
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,980
ARRANGE A COLLABORATION BETWEEN

301
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,980
AMERICA AND THE U.S.S.R., AT THE

302
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,980
HEIGHT OF THE COLD WAR, ONE OF

303
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,980
THE LAST BIG COUNTRIES WHERE

304
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,980
SMALLPOX HAD TO BE TACKLED WAS

305
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,980
INDIA, AND JUST LISTEN TO ONE OF

306
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,980
THE DOCTORS INVOLVED IN THE

307
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,980
EFFORT EXPLAIN WHAT IT TOOK.

308
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,980
TO ERADICATE SMALLPOX,

309
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,980
IT MEANT THAT WE WOULD HAVE

310
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,980
TO VISIT EVERY SINGLE HOUSE IN

311
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,980
INDIA.

312
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,980
AND ULTIMATELY, WE DID.

313
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,000
WE VISITED 120 MILLION HOUSES

314
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,980
IN INDIA EVERY MONTH FOR ABOUT

315
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,980
20 MONTHS.

316
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,976
WE DID MORE THAN A BILLION HOUSE

317
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,980
THINK ABOUT THAT!

318
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,980
THEY VISITED A BILLION HOUSES!

319
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,980
THAT'S REMARKABLE.

320
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,980
IT'S ONLY A FEW MORE HOUSES

321
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,980
THAN CHRISHELL VISITED ON

322
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,980
"SELLING SUNSET."

323
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,980
AND THAT'S WHY SHE'S THE BEST.

324
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,980
YOU POUND THE PAVEMENT.

325
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,980
YOU GET THE LISTINGS AND YOU GET

326
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,980
THE RESULTS.

327
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,976
I DON'T KNOW WHERE CHRISHELL

328
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,980
HUSTLES MORE,
ON THE STREETS OF L.A. OR ON

329
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,980
THE "DANCING WITH THE STARS"

330
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,980
DANCE FLOOR.

331
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,980
#TeamChrishell.

332
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,980
BUT THE W.H.O.'S WORK ISN'T

333
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,980
ALWAYS AS LOFTY AS DOOR-TO-DOOR

334
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,980
DISEASE DESTRUCTION.

335
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,880
SOME OF ITS MOST IMPORTANT WORK

336
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,980
INVOLVES THE DEVELOPMENT OF

337
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,520
THE SEASONAL FLU VACCINE.

338
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,980
TWICE A YEAR, IT CONVENES

339
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,980
REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL OVER

340
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,980
THE WORLD TO DETERMINE WHAT

341
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,980
STRAINS OF THE FLU VIRUS SHOULD

342
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,000
GO INTO THE ANNUAL FLU SHOT.

343
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,980
WHICH MIGHT SOUND TEDIOUS...

344
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,980
BECAUSE IT IS... BUT IT'S ALSO

345
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,980
KIND OF IMPORTANT.

346
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,980
THAT, BY THE WAY, WAS THE

347
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,980
ORIGINAL TITLE FOR THIS SHOW.

348
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,980
THE W.H.O. IS ALSO CURRENTLY

349
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,980
TRACKING AND RESPONDING TO

350
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,980
DOZENS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE

351
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,980
OUTBREAKS AROUND THE WORLD,

352
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,980
INCLUDING MONKEYPOX,

353
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,980
YELLOW FEVER, AND AN ONGOING

354
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,976
EBOLA OUTBREAK.

355
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,980
AND WHEN, LET'S SAY,
HYPOTHETICALLY, A PANDEMIC

356
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,980
BREAKS OUT, THE ORGANIZATION

357
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,980
CAN PROVIDE A CRITICAL ROLE

358
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,980
AS A CENTRAL CLEARINGHOUSE OF

359
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,980
INFORMATION, CONDUCTING

360
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,980
INVESTIGATIONS, AND RELEASING

361
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,976
INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC.

362
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,960
AND IT DOES ALL OF THIS

363
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,980
ON A CURRENT BUDGET OF

364
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,980
$2.4 BILLION A YEAR.

365
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,980
WHICH MIGHT SOUND LIKE A LOT,

366
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,980
BUT IT'S AROUND THE SAME AMOUNT

367
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,980
IT COSTS TO RUN A SINGLE

368
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,980
U.S. HOSPITAL.

369
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,980
WHICH IS WILD.

370
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,980
IT'S LIKE FINDING OUT THAT THE

371
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,980
U.S. NAVY RUNS ON THE SAME

372
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,980
BUDGET AS TYPHOON LAGOON AT

373
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,980
DISNEY WORLD.

374
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,980
I'M NOT SURE IF TYPHOON LAGOON'S

375
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,980
BUDGET IS WAY TOO HIGH, OR THE

376
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,980
NAVY'S IS WAY TOO LOW, BUT

377
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,980
SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY OFF

378
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,980
THERE.

379
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,980
SO AT ITS BEST, THE W.H.O. DOES

380
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,980
VITALLY IMPORTANT WORK FOR

381
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,980
SHOCKINGLY LITTLE MONEY.

382
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,980
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT IT'S

383
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,980
PERFECT.

384
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,980
THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CRITICISMS

385
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,980
OF HOW IT'S BEHAVED IN THE PAST,

386
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,980
AMONG THEM THAT DURING THE EBOLA

387
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,980
OUTBREAK IN 2014, THEY ACTED TOO

388
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,980
SLOWLY TO DECLARE A PUBLIC

389
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,980
HEALTH EMERGENCY, WHICH HAD

390
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,980
MAJOR CONSEQUENCES.

391
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,980
BUT THE TRUTH IS, FOR TRUMP,

392
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,980
PAST PERFORMANCE ISN'T REALLY

393
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,980
THE ISSUE HERE.

394
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,980
FOR HIM, THERE ARE TWO

395
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,980
INSURMOUNTABLE PROBLEMS

396
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,980
WITH THE W.H.O.

397
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,980
THE FIRST IS HOW MUCH OF ITS

398
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,000
BUDGET THE U.S. PAYS.

399
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,980
WE PAY $400 TO $500 MILLION

400
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,980
A YEAR.

401
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,980
CHINA'S PAYING $38, $39,

402
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,980
AND $40 MILLION A YEAR.

403
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,980
AND IT'S LIKE THEY CONTROL THIS

404
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,980
GROUP.

405
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,976
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY BAD

406
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,980
GOING ON. AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

407
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,980
I'VE GOTTEN VERY MUCH INVOLVED.

408
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,980
IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG

409
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,980
PERIOD OF TIME, AND WE DON'T

410
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,980
WANT TO BE THE SUCKERS ANYMORE.

411
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,980
NOW, YOU'RE PROBABLY

412
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,980
ALREADY ASSUMING IT'S MORE

413
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,980
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

414
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,980
AND IT IS.

415
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,980
THE PROBLEM IS, TRUMP IS

416
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,980
INCAPABLE OF ACKNOWLEDGING

417
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,980
NUANCE.

418
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,976
IN HIS WORLD, YOU'RE EITHER

419
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,960
FUCKING SOMEONE, OR YOU'RE

420
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,980
GETTING FUCKED.

421
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,980
AND THAT'S NOT A GREAT

422
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,980
PERSPECTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO

423
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,980
COOPERATING ON GLOBAL HEALTH.

424
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,980
IT'S NOT EVEN A GREAT

425
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,980
PERSPECTIVE AT AN ORGY.

426
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,980
SURE, THERE'S A LOT OF BOTH

427
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,980
GOING ON, BUT THOSE CAN'T BE

428
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,980
THE ONLY OPTIONS.

429
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,980
SOMEONE'S GOTTA MAKE SURE

430
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,980
EVERYONE'S STAYING HYDRATED,

431
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,980
SOMEONE'S GOTTA BE AVAILABLE

432
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,980
TO TIP THE PIZZA DELIVERY

433
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,980
PERSON, SOMEONE'S GOT TO

434
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,980
DISINFECT THE COFFEE TABLE

435
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,980
AFTERWARDS.

436
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,980
IT CAN'T ALL BE JUST FUCKING AND

437
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,976
GETTING FUCKED, OR THERE'S GOING

438
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,980
TO BE CHAOS.
THAT'S BASIC ORGY MANAGEMENT.

439
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,980
NOW WHAT IS TRUE IN TRUMP'S

440
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,980
ARGUMENT IS THAT THERE'S A BIG

441
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,980
DISCREPANCY BETWEEN WHAT

442
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,980
THE U.S. AND CHINA GIVE TO

443
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,980
THE W.H.O.

444
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,980
IN 2019, THE U.S. PAID JUST OVER

445
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,980
$446 MILLION.

446
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,980
AND CHINA, THE SECOND LARGEST

447
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,980
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, PAID

448
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,980
JUST $43 MILLION.

449
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,980
THAT IS A STRIKING DISPARITY.

450
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,980
BUT IT'S ROOTED IN HOW

451
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,980
THE W.H.O. IS FUNDED.

452
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,980
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, ONLY AROUND

453
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,980
17% OF ITS FUNDING COMES THROUGH

454
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,980
ASSESSED CONTRIBUTIONS,

455
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,980
WHICH ARE BASICALLY MEMBERSHIP

456
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,980
DUES BASED ON THE SIZE OF EACH

457
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,980
COUNTRY'S ECONOMY AND

458
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,980
POPULATION.

459
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,980
ALMOST ALL OF THE REST COMES

460
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,980
THROUGH VOLUNTARY

461
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,980
CONTRIBUTIONS.

462
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,980
THAT'S WHERE A COUNTRY DONATES

463
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,980
MONEY, BUT IN DOING SO, CAN

464
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,980
EARMARK EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT

465
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,980
IT USED FOR.

466
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,980
AND MOST OF WHAT THE U.S. PAYS

467
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,980
EACH YEAR IS VOLUNTARY

468
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,980
CONTRIBUTIONS, WHEREAS CHINA

469
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,980
CHOOSES TO PAY ALMOST NOTHING.

470
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,980
AND YOU COULD ARGUE THIS IS A

471
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,980
DUMB WAY TO FUND AN

472
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,980
ORGANIZATION; IT'S ESSENTIALLY

473
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,980
THE GLOBAL HEALTH EQUIVALENT OF

474
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,980
UNDERFUNDING A PUBLIC SCHOOL AND

475
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,980
EXPECTING IT TO HOLD A BAKE SALE

476
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,980
TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE.

477
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,980
BUT THE THING IS, THIS WHOLE

478
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,980
MESS IS ALMOST ENTIRELY

479
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,980
AMERICA'S FAULT.

480
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,980
BACK IN THE 1980s,

481
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,980
THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION PUSHED

482
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,980
A ZERO-GROWTH POLICY FOR

483
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,980
THE W.H.O.'S BUDGET, WHICH

484
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,980
EVENTUALLY FROZE STATES'

485
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,980
ASSESSED CONTRIBUTIONS AT

486
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,980
1990s LEVELS.

487
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,980
SO WITH THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS

488
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,980
UNABLE TO GO UP, THE W.H.O. HAS

489
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,980
NATURALLY NEEDED MORE AND MORE

490
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,980
VOLUNTARY DONATIONS

491
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,980
AS THE YEARS HAVE GONE BY.

492
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,980
AND I WOULD SAY THAT WAS THE

493
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,980
WORST DECISION OF THE REAGAN

494
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,980
WHITE HOUSE, WERE IT NOT FOR

495
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,980
IRAN-CONTRA, THE WAR ON DRUGS,

496
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,980
TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS, AND

497
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,980
FAILING TO PUBLICLY SAY

498
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,980
THE WORD "AIDS" FOR FOUR YEARS.

499
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,980
I'M NOT SAYING EVERYTHING IS

500
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,980
REAGAN'S FAULT, ALL I'M SAYING

501
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,980
IS, IF I FOUND OUT TOMORROW THAT

502
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,980
MURDER HORNETS ARE ONLY HERE

503
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,980
BECAUSE HE STARTED BREEDING THEM

504
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,980
IN 1988, I CAN'T SAY I'D BE

505
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,980
ENTIRELY SURPRISED.

506
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,980
THE POINT IS, THAT IS WHY WE PAY

507
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,980
SO MUCH RELATIVE TO CHINA.

508
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:21,980
IT'S MOSTLY BECAUSE WE CHOOSE

509
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,980
TO BECAUSE THE W.H.O. IS

510
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,980
UNDERFUNDED BECAUSE OF

511
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,980
SOMETHING WE DID.

512
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,980
SO WHAT ABOUT TRUMP'S SECOND BIG

513
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,980
COMPLAINT, THAT THE W.H.O. IS A

514
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,980
LITERAL PIPE ORGAN FOR CHINA?

515
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,980
WHICH, AGAIN, IT LITERALLY

516
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,980
ISN'T.

517
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,980
THAT IS AN IDEA THAT HE AND HIS

518
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,980
SUPPORTERS HAVE HAMMERED HARD.

519
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,980
THE WORLD HEALTH

520
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,976
ORGANIZATION'S SUBSERVIENCE TO

521
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,980
THEIR MASTERS IN BEIJING HAS
ONLY BECOME MORE OBVIOUSLY MORE

522
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,980
NAKED.

523
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,980
ALLOWING THE WORLD HEALTH

524
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,980
ORGANIZATION TO INVESTIGATE

525
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,976
CHINA IS LIKE HAVING EL CHAPO

526
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,980
INVESTIGATE THE MEXICAN DRUG
CARTELS.

527
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,980
I MEAN, CHINA LIED, THE WORLD

528
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,980
HEALTH ORGANIZATION COMPLIED,

529
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,980
AND AS A RESULT, MANY AMERICANS

530
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,980
DIED.

531
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,976
OKAY, NOW I KNOW THAT

532
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,960
RHYME SOUNDED COMPELLING,

533
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,980
BUT IT'S
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: NOT

534
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,980
EVERYTHING THAT RHYMES IS TRUE.

535
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,980
HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU.

536
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,980
"IN 1981 JAMES COMER WAS UP TO

537
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,980
NO GOOD, HE STOOD ON A BOAT AND

538
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,980
PUSHED AS HARD AS HE COULD, AND

539
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,980
THAT'S HOW JAMES COMER KILLED

540
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,980
NATALIE WOOD."

541
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,980
THAT'S A FANTASTIC RHYME,

542
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,980
NO QUESTIONS THERE.

543
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:20,980
BUT I DO HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT IT

544
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,980
MIGHT BE UNTRUE.

545
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,980
WHAT THEY'RE ARGUING THERE IS,

546
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,980
THE W.H.O. MISHANDLED THE

547
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,980
PANDEMIC BECAUSE THEY'RE

548
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,980
DEFERENTIAL TO CHINA.

549
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,980
AND WHILE THERE'S SOME TRUTH TO

550
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,980
EACH HALF OF THAT STATEMENT,

551
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,980
THEY'RE NOT TRUE TOGETHER.

552
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,980
AND LET'S START WITH THE

553
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,976
ALLEGATION THE W.H.O. IS

554
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,980
DEFERENTIAL TO CHINA.
THAT CAN BE TRUE.

555
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,980
FOR INSTANCE, ITS MEMBER STATES

556
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,980
HAVE CONSISTENTLY ACQUIESCED TO

557
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,980
CHINA'S INSISTENCE THAT TAIWAN

558
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,980
NOT BE ALLOWED TO JOIN THE

559
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,980
ORGANIZATION AS A SEPARATE

560
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,980
ENTITY.

561
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,000
AND W.H.O. LEADERSHIP PRAISED

562
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,980
CHINA EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC,

563
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,980
CITING ITS "BOLD APPROACH TO

564
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,980
CONTAIN THE RAPID SPREAD"

565
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,980
OF THE CORONAVIRUS, WHICH

566
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,980
DOES NOT DATE WELL.

567
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,980
ALTHOUGH, IT IS IMPORTANT TO

568
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,980
REMEMBER, THE W.H.O. NEEDS

569
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,980
TO BE EXCEEDINGLY DIPLOMATIC

570
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,980
WITH ITS MEMBER COUNTRIES TO

571
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,980
GAIN THE ACCESS IT NEEDS FOR

572
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,980
ON-THE-GROUND INVESTIGATIONS

573
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,980
AS AN OUTBREAK EMERGES.

574
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,980
ALSO, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

575
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,980
IT'S NOT LIKE IT WAS ALONE IN

576
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,980
PRAISING CHINA'S CORONAVIRUS

577
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,980
RESPONSE.

578
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,980
BACK IN FEBRUARY, TRUMP WAS

579
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,976
WORKING OUT A TRADE DEAL WITH

580
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,980
CHINA, AND HE SAID THIS.
CHINA IS WORKING VERY, VERY

581
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,980
HARD.

582
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,980
I HAVE SPOKEN TO PRESIDENT XI,

583
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,980
AND THEY'RE WORKING VERY HARD.

584
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,980
IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM,

585
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,980
I THINK HE'LL BE IN PRETTY GOOD

586
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,980
SHAPE.

587
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,980
THEY'VE HAD A ROUGH PATCH, AND I

588
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,980
THINK RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE IT...

589
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,980
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GETTING IT

590
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:42,980
UNDER CONTROL MORE AND MORE.

591
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,980
OH OH, AND THAT WAS

592
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,340
BY NO MEANS A ONE OFF.

593
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,980
TRUMP PRAISED CHINA'S RESPONSE

594
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,976
SO MANY TIMES POLITICO MADE IT

595
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,980
INTO AN ACTUAL LISTICLE AND
THAT'S A SERIOUS UNIT OF

596
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,980
MEASUREMENT.

597
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,980
TRUMP'S JOINING THE RANKS OF

598
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,980
"15 HEDGEHOGS WITH THINGS THAT

599
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,980
LOOK LIKE HEDGEHOGS," OR

600
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,980
"TOP 10 ACTORS WHO DIED IN

601
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,980
FIRES, " OR " 16 PEOPLE WHO WERE

602
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,980
LITERAL CHILDREN IN 2010 BUT

603
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,980
FULL GROWN ADULTS NOW," WHICH I

604
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,980
ASSUME WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE

605
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,980
WHO JUST EMERGED FROM A COMA

606
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,980
AND FORGOT HOW TIME WORKS,

607
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,980
INCIDENTALLY MAKING THEM

608
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,980
ELIGIBLE FOR "TIME" MAGAZINE'S

609
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,980
VERY REAL LISTICLE,

610
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,980
"TOP 10 COMAS."

611
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,640
NOW, AS FOR THE QUESTION OF

612
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,980
WHETHER THE W.H.O. MADE MISTAKES

613
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,700
EARLY ON, IT DEFINITELY DID.

614
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,960
IT ARGUABLY TOOK TOO LONG TO

615
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,980
ADVISE UNIVERSAL MASK WEARING

616
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,980
AND TO CLEARLY ACKNOWLEDGE

617
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,980
THE THREAT OF INDOOR AIRBORNE

618
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,976
TRANSMISSION.

619
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,996
BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AT ALL
THAT THIS WAS DONE TO APPEASE

620
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,980
CHINA, SO MUCH AS, IN THE EARLY

621
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,580
STAGES OF A PANDEMIC, EVEN

622
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,980
EXPERTS TEND TO... TO USE A

623
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,980
TECHNICAL TERM... NOT KNOW WHAT

624
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,980
THE FUCK IS GOING ON.

625
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,980
BUT LET'S SAY, FOR THE SAKE OF

626
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,980
ARGUMENT, THAT YOU AGREE WITH

627
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,980
THE PRESIDENT THAT WE SIMPLY PAY

628
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,980
TOO MUCH TO THE W.H.O., AND THAT

629
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,980
CHINA IS CALLING ALL THE SHOTS

630
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,976
THERE.

631
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,960
THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES, WHAT

632
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,980
THEN? AND IF YOU LISTEN TO

633
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,980
MIKE POMPEO, WHICH YOU

634
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,980
ABSOLUTELY NEVER SHOULD,

635
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,980
HE WOULD ARGUE THE U.S. CAN JUST

636
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,980
GO IT ALONE.

637
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,980
IF THERE IS A FUNCTION THAT

638
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,980
ONLY THE W.H.O. CAN DO, AND WE

639
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,980
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR

640
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,980
AMERICAN NATIONAL SECURITY OR

641
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,980
BECAUSE WE ARE GOOD HUMANITARIAN

642
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,980
PARTNERS AROUND THE WORLD,

643
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,980
I'M CONFIDENT WE WILL FIND A WAY

644
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,000
TO DELIVER THAT OUTCOME.

645
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,980
OKAY, THAT IS JUST RIDICULOUS.

646
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,980
THE U.S. CANNOT DO WHAT THE

647
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,980
W.H.O. DOES, FOR MANY, MANY

648
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,980
REASONS.

649
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,980
FOR A START, IF WE TRY AND GO

650
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,580
INTO ANOTHER COUNTRY FOR A

651
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,976
PUBLIC HEALTH MISSION, CHANCES

652
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,980
ARE WE'RE GOING TO GET GREETED
FAR LESS WARMLY.

653
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,980
BECAUSE THE W.H.O. HAS NEVER,

654
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,980
Y'KNOW, INVADED A NATION OR

655
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,980
FUNDED A COUP.

656
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,980
AS ONE FORMER U.S.

657
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,980
REPRESENTATIVE TO THE

658
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,980
ORGANIZATION HAS SAID, "PEOPLE

659
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,980
COMING INTO COUNTRIES IN W.H.O.

660
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,980
SHIRTS TO WORK ON POLIO OR AIDS

661
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,980
ARE LESS THREATENING."

662
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,980
ADDING, "NO ONE IS LOOKING FOR

663
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,980
U.S.-BASED ALTERNATIVES TO

664
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,980
W.H.O."

665
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,880
WHICH, OF COURSE THEY'RE NOT...

666
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,960
ESPECIALLY HAVING SEEN THE WAY

667
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,980
THAT WE'VE HANDLED THE
CORONAVIRUS.

668
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,980
NOBODY WANTS A U.S.-BASED

669
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,980
ALTERNATIVE HERE FOR THE SAME

670
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,980
REASON NOBODY'S LOOKING FOR A

671
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,980
JOE EXOTIC-BASED ALTERNATIVE TO

672
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,980
"JEOPARDY."

673
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,980
I'M NOT SAYING HE DOESN'T THINK

674
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,020
HE CAN DO IT.

675
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,980
BUT EVERYONE LIKES THE WAY IT

676
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,980
WORKS NOW, AND HIS ALTERNATIVE

677
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,980
MIGHT BE ACTIVELY DANGEROUS.

678
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,980
ALSO, WHEN IT COMES TO GLOBAL

679
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,980
HEALTH, THE U.S. HAS A CHECKERED

680
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,020
PAST.

681
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,980
BEFORE THE KILLING OF BIN LADEN,

682
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,980
ONE OF THE WAYS THE U.S.

683
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,980
VERIFIED HE WAS IN ABBOTABAD WAS

684
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,980
BY STAGING A FAKE VACCINATION

685
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,980
CAMPAIGN IN THAT TOWN AS A RUSE

686
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,980
TO GATHER DNA SAMPLES FROM THE

687
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,820
PEOPLE LIVING AT HIS COMPOUND,

688
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,980
SOMETHING WHICH NOT ONLY PUT

689
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,980
HEALTH WORKERS IN THE REGION AT

690
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,980
RISK, BUT ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO A

691
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,980
MAJOR SETBACK IN THE EFFORT TO

692
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,980
VACCINATE PEOPLE IN PAKISTAN

693
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,980
AGAINST POLIO.

694
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,980
AND IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE GOING TO

695
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,000
MAKE FRIENDS BY SUDDENLY WALKING

696
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,980
AWAY FROM THE W.H.O. AND CUTTING

697
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,980
OFF ITS FUNDING, ESPECIALLY IN

698
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,980
THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC.

699
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,980
AS ONE OFFICIAL PUTS IT,

700
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,980
THE U.S. DECISION TO LEAVE IS

701
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,980
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET YOUR

702
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,980
HEAD AROUND.

703
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,980
AND SOMETIMES IT FEELS

704
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,980
LIKE A BAD DREAM.

705
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,980
AND FOR STAFF INSIDE THE

706
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,980
ORGANIZATION, THEY FEEL

707
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,976
DUMBFOUNDED.

708
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,980
COULD SOMEBODY EXPLAIN TO ME
WHY?

709
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,980
REALLY, WHY?

710
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,980
WHY TAKE THE FIRE ENGINES AWAY

711
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,980
IN THE MIDDLE OF FIGHTING A

712
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,980
FIRE?

713
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,980
EXACTLY!

714
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,980
IT'S TAKING THE FIRE ENGINES

715
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,980
AWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF FIGHTING

716
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,980
THE FIRE, OR GETTING RID OF

717
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,980
THE LIFEBOATS WHILE THE BOAT IS

718
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,980
SINKING, OR CHOOSING TO EDIT

719
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,980
KEVIN SPACEY INTO A MOVIE JUST

720
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,980
WEEKS BEFORE ITS RELEASE DATE...

721
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,980
IT'S THE WORST POSSIBLE DECISION

722
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,980
AT THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME.

723
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,000
AND IT GETS EVEN WORSE HERE,

724
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,980
BECAUSE THE W.H.O. IS RIGHT

725
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,980
ON THE EDGE OF DOING TO POLIO

726
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,980
WHAT IT DID TO SMALLPOX AND

727
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,980
ELIMINATING IT.

728
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,980
JUST TWO MONTHS AGO, IT WAS

729
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,980
FINALLY WIPED OUT IN AFRICA,

730
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,980
AND WE ARE NOW 99% OF THE

731
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,980
WAY TO GLOBAL ERADICATION,

732
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,980
WITH A CURRENT GOAL FOR IT

733
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,980
TO HAPPEN IN 2023.

734
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,980
UNFORTUNATELY, THE U.S. IS

735
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,980
THE SECOND LARGEST FUNDER OF

736
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,980
THE GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION

737
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,980
INITIATIVE, AND THAT MONEY

738
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:44,980
SUDDENLY DISAPPEARING IS LIKELY

739
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,980
TO SET EVERYTHING BACK.

740
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,980
AND WHILE IT ALMOST FEELS

741
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,980
INAPPROPRIATE FOR POLIO NOT TO

742
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,640
MAKE A COMEBACK DURING THIS

743
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,980
FUCKING NIGHTMARE OF A YEAR,

744
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,980
WE SHOULD STILL PROBABLY TRY TO

745
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,980
PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING.

746
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,940
AND LOOK, IT IS FINE IF THE U.S.

747
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,980
HAS PROBLEMS WITH THE W.H.O.

748
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,980
IT HAS PROBLEMS.

749
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:03,980
BUT THE SOLUTION CLEARLY ISN'T

750
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,980
TO WALK AWAY.

751
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,980
IT'S TO TRY AND FIX THEM.

752
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,980
BUT THE ONLY WAY FOR THE U.S. TO

753
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,980
HAVE A SAY IN HOW THAT HAPPENS

754
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,980
IS TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE,

755
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,980
AND WE'RE ABOUT TO JUST GIVE

756
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,980
THAT UP.

757
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,980
AND THE THING IS,

758
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,980
THIS IS YET ANOTHER

759
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,980
DEPRESSING EXAMPLE OF TRUMP

760
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,980
SEEING SOMETHING THAT INVOLVES

761
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,980
SHARED SACRIFICE, TRADE-OFFS,

762
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,980
AND COMPLEXITY, AND DECIDING TO

763
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,980
JUST BLOW IT UP, BECAUSE HE

764
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,980
EITHER DOESN'T UNDERSTAND IT,

765
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,980
DOESN'T CARE, OR BOTH.

766
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,980
WE'VE SEEN THIS WITH

767
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,980
THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT AND

768
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,980
THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL.

769
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,980
AND NOW HE'S DOING IT WITH

770
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,980
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION.

771
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,976
AND THIS IS INCREDIBLY

772
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,980
DANGEROUS.
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, WE'RE

773
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,980
CURRENTLY ON TRACK TO LEAVE THE

774
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,980
W.H.O. ON JULY 6th OF NEXT YEAR

775
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,980
IF, THAT IS, TRUMP IS

776
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,980
RE-ELECTED.

777
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,980
AND THIS MEANS OUR MEMBERSHIP

778
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,980
IN THE W.H.O. IS YET ANOTHER

779
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,980
IMPORTANT THING ON THE BALLOT

780
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,980
THIS YEAR.

781
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,980
AND EVEN THOUGH TRUMP LIKES

782
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,980
TO PRETEND WE CAN INSULATE

783
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,980
OURSELVES FROM THE REST OF

784
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:56,980
THE WORLD, IF THE CORONAVIRUS

785
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,980
HAS SHOWN US ANYTHING,

786
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,980
IT'S THAT DISEASES DON'T

787
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,980
RECOGNIZE BORDERS, AND WE'RE

788
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,280
ONLY AS STRONG AS OUR

789
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,980
WORST-PREPARED COUNTRY.

790
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,980
AND PULLING OUT OF THE W.H.O. AT

791
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,980
ANY TIME, BUT ESPECIALLY IN THE

792
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,980
MIDST OF A PANDEMIC THAT'S

793
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,980
KILLED OVER 200,000 AMERICANS

794
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,980
AND A MILLION PEOPLE AROUND

795
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,980
THE WORLD IS ONE OF THE MOST

796
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,980
ILL-ADVISED, DUMBEST THINGS WE

797
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,980
COULD POSSIBLY DO.

798
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,976
AND I MEAN THAT FUCKING

799
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
LITERALLY. AND NOW THIS.

800
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,980
AND NOW...

801
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,980
THERE'S AN OLD SAYING IN

802
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,980
POLITICS.

803
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,980
THERE'S AN OLD SAYING IN

804
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,980
POLITICS, WHICH IS, YOU'VE GOT

805
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,980
TO DANCE WITH THE GIRL THAT

806
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,980
BRUNG YOU.

807
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,980
THERE'S A SAYING IN POLITICS

808
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,980
THAT FISH ALWAYS FLOP AROUND

809
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,980
BEFORE THEY DIE.

810
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,820
OLIVIA, THERE'S A SAYING IN

811
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,976
PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS THAT

812
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,980
SUMMER IS FOR DATING, FALL IS
FOR MATING.

813
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,980
THERE IS AN OLD SAYING IN

814
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,980
POLITICS, WHEN YOU ARE WHINING,

815
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,980
YOU ARE NOT WINNING.

816
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,980
THERE'S AN OLD SAYING IN

817
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,980
TEXAS POLITICS THAT THE GUILTY

818
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,980
DOG BARKS THE LOUDEST.

819
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,980
WE HAVE A SAYING ON OUR

820
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,980
CAMPAIGN, FEAR THE TURTLE.

821
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,980
AS THE SAYING GOES, THERE'S

822
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,980
NOTHING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

823
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,980
ROAD BUT YELLOW LINES AND

824
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,976
DEAD ARMADILLOS.

825
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,980
THERE IS NOTHING IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE ROAD BUT

826
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,980
YELLOW LINES AND

827
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,980
DEAD ARMADILLOS.

828
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,980
THEY SAY YELLOW LINES AND

829
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,980
DEAD ARMADILLOS IN THE MIDDLE

830
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,980
OF THE ROAD.

831
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,976
YOU WON UP AND DOWN.

832
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,500
WHAT?

833
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,980
MOVING ON.

834
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,980
A QUICK UPDATE

835
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,980
REGARDING DANBURY, CONNECTICUT.

836
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,980
DUBBED AMERICA'S "HAT CITY"

837
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,980
BY "MEANINGLESS BYGONE

838
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,980
SUPERLATIVES" MAGAZINE.

839
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,980
YOU MAY REMEMBER, A FEW MONTHS

840
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,980
AGO, WE INSULTED THE UNASSUMING

841
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,980
CITY OF DANBURY FOR NO CLEAR

842
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,980
REASON.

843
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,980
AND THE CITIZENS THERE

844
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,980
RESPONDED, WITH MULTIPLE

845
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,980
DANBURIANS INSULTING ME IN

846
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,980
YOUTUBE VIDEOS, AND THE MAYOR

847
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,980
DECLARING THAT HE'D NAME THEIR

848
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,980
SEWAGE PLANT "THE JOHN OLIVER

849
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,980
MEMORIAL SEWER PLANT" BECAUSE

850
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,980
IT'S FULL OF SHIT JUST LIKE ME.

851
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,980
ALL OF WHICH WAS EXCELLENT.

852
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,980
DISAPPOINTINGLY, THE MAYOR THEN

853
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,980
CLAIMED HIS THREAT WAS JUST

854
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,980
A JOKE.

855
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,980
SO TO TRY TO FORCE HIS HAND,

856
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,980
WE OFFERED TO DONATE $55,000 TO

857
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,980
LOCAL CHARITIES ON THE STRICT

858
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,980
CONDITION THEY MADE THE NAME

859
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,980
OFFICIAL.

860
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,980
WELL, THERE HAS BEEN A BIT OF

861
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,980
AN UPDATE.

862
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,980
A CHEEKY BACK AND FORTH

863
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,980
BETWEEN THE CITY OF DANBURY AND

864
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,980
POPULAR SHOW HOST JOHN OLIVER

865
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,980
MAKING A STINK IN THIS CITY.

866
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,980
TONIGHT, IT WAS FRONT AND

867
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,980
CENTER AT THE CITY'S VIRTUAL

868
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,020
COUNCIL MEETING.

869
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,980
THE MAYOR READING SUPPORTIVE

870
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,980
COMMENTS FROM RESIDENTS.

871
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,980
THE COMMUNITY SPIRIT THIS

872
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,980
FEUD HAS GENERATED IS

873
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,980
PRICELESS.

874
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,980
A VOTE GOT PUSHED TO THURSDAY

875
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,980
BUT THE MAYOR TOLD US THE VOTES

876
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,980
ARE THERE.

877
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,980
HE BELIEVES THE FEUD IS CREATING

878
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,980
ANOTHER TOURIST DESTINATION IN

879
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,980
THE STATE.

880
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,980
I'VE GOT SMALL BLEACHERS SET

881
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,980
UP OUTSIDE THE PONDS THAT HOLD

882
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,980
ALL OF THE SOLID WASTE AND YOU

883
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,980
CAN SIT ON YOUR BLEACHER, HAVE

884
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,980
YOUR PICNIC, AND WATCH THE PLANT

885
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,980
OPERATE.

886
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,980
AND IT'LL BE VERY, VERY

887
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,980
EXCITING.

888
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,980
THERE IS A LOT TO LOVE

889
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,980
THERE.

890
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,980
FROM TO THE TOWN'S SEEMING

891
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:26,980
ENTHUSIASM, TO THE FACT THAT

892
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,980
THE MAYOR SEEMS TO THINK

893
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,980
WATCHING WATER FILTRATION IS

894
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,980
A MUST-SEE THRILL RIDE.

895
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,980
NO ONE ENJOYS SITTING IN

896
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,976
BLEACHERS WATCHING RAW SEWAGE

897
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,720
MOVE AROUND.

898
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,980
JUST ASK ANY FAN OF

899
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,980
THE NEW YORK GIANTS.

900
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,980
IT'S BEEN A ROUGH FEW SEASONS.

901
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,980
BUT THE FACT IS, THINGS HAVE

902
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,980
ESCALATED HERE.

903
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:42,980
LOCAL BUSINESSES STARTED

904
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,980
A FUNDRAISER SUPPORTING THE

905
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,980
EFFORT, AND HAVE SO FAR RAISED

906
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,980
$45,000 FOR AREA FOOD BANKS.

907
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,980
DANBURY'S LOCAL HOCKEY TEAM HAS

908
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,980
BEEN SELLING SPECIAL HAT TRICKS

909
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,980
T-SHIRTS BENEFITING ALS

910
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,980
CONNECTICUT WITH THE NAME OF

911
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,980
THE CHARACTER I PLAYED IN 2008'S

912
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,980
"THE LOVE GURU."

913
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,880
AND MAYOR MARK IS EVEN OFFERING

914
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,980
TO GIVE PERSONAL TOURS OF THE

915
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,980
SEWER PLANT FOR $500 APIECE...

916
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,980
AGAIN, ALL FOR CHARITY.

917
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,980
IT'S ALL BEEN GOING VERY WELL.

918
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,880
BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD THERE,

919
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,980
THE VOTE WAS POSTPONED UNTIL

920
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,980
LAST THURSDAY, WHICH IS HOW I

921
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,980
FOUND MYSELF AT HOME, WATCHING

922
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,980
DANBURY CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS ON

923
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,980
ZOOM WITH BATED BREATH.

924
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,700
AND I WILL SAY, SOME MEMBERS

925
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,980
EXPRESSED CONCERNS.

926
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,980
WHILE I APPRECIATE THE HUMOR

927
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,980
DURING A TIME WHEN WE COULD ALL

928
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,980
USE A LAUGH, I'D HAVE TO SAY

929
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,980
THAT I PERSONALLY DON'T FIND

930
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,980
ANYTHING FUNNY ABOUT INSULTING

931
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,980
OUR COMMUNITY, AND LEAST OF ALL,

932
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,976
ABOUT THREATENING VIOLENCE

933
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,980
TOWARDS CHILDREN.
I'M JUST GONNA BE VOTING NO.

934
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,980
YOU KNOW WHAT?

935
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,980
THAT'S FAIR.

936
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,980
I DID INVITE ALL DANBURIANS

937
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,980
TO COME GET A THRASHING FROM ME,

938
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,980
CHILDREN INCLUDED.

939
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,980
ALTHOUGH IN MY DEFENSE, I'M

940
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,980
CLEARLY NO THREAT TO ANYBODY.

941
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,980
I HAVE THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF

942
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,980
AL DENTE SPAGHETTI.

943
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,980
IF I WAS WAS A BOXER, MY WEIGHT

944
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,980
CLASS WOULD BE "NOT DETECTED,"

945
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,980
AND MY ENTRANCE MUSIC WOULD BE

946
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,976
NORMA JEAN'S "PLEASE DON'T

947
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,980
HURT ME." I AM FRAGILE.

948
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,980
AND THAT MAN WAS NOT THE ONLY

949
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,980
ONE WITH QUALMS.

950
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,980
I'M REALLY PROUD OF OUR

951
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,980
WASTE TREATMENT PLANT.

952
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,980
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID

953
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,980
YEARS AGO WHEN I GOT ON THE

954
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,976
COUNCIL, ALONG WITH

955
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,960
COUNCILMAN CHIANESE,

956
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,980
IS ORGANIZE A TOUR,

957
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,980
AND WE TOOK A TOUR OF THE PLANT.

958
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:02,980
AND I WAS AGOG.

959
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,980
I THOUGHT IT WAS, LIKE, THIS

960
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,980
AMAZING MACHINE THAT TURNS,

961
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,980
YOU KNOW, STUFF YOU DON'T REALLY

962
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,980
WANT ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SHOE

963
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,980
INTO SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN

964
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,980
DRINK OR ALMOST DRINK.

965
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,980
SO I, YOU KNOW, WHEN I HEARD WE

966
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,976
WERE NAMING THAT MACHINE THAT'S

967
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,960
INTEGRAL TO THE COMMUNITY AFTER

968
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,977
THIS GUY, I... NO WAY.

969
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:21,997
GOD, I LOVE

970
00:26:22,021 --> 00:26:23,980
CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS.

971
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,980
WHERE ELSE CAN YOU HEAR SOMEONE

972
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,980
TALK ABOUT THE TIME THEY WERE

973
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,980
STRUCK SPEECHLESS BY

974
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,980
THE SHEER BEAUTY OF

975
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,980
MUNICIPAL WASTE FILTRATION?

976
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,980
ALTHOUGH HE DOES GLOSS PRETTY

977
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,980
QUICKLY OVER THE DIFFERENCE

978
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,980
BETWEEN "WATER YOU CAN DRINK"

979
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,980
AND "WATER YOU CAN ALMOST

980
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,980
DRINK."

981
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,976
YOU CAN ALMOST DRINK A LOT OF

982
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,500
THINGS!

983
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,980
MERCURY, ANTIFREEZE,

984
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,980
MOUNTAIN DEW.

985
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:40,980
"ALMOST" CAN DO A LOT OF

986
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,980
HEAVY LIFTING.

987
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,980
ALTHOUGH, I AM HAPPY TO SAY

988
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,980
THAT MAN EVENTUALLY VOTED YES,

989
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,980
ALTHOUGH IN DOING SO, SAID HE

990
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,980
HOPED I'D "COME TO TERMS WITH

991
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,980
THE STATEMENTS I MADE

992
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,980
TOWARDS DANBURY."

993
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,980
WHICH I ABSOLUTELY HAVE, AND I

994
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,000
REGRET NOTHING.

995
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,980
BUT LOOK, THE MEETING CULMINATED

996
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,980
IN A NAIL-BITING ROLL-CALL VOTE,

997
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,980
AFTER WHICH, THE RESULTS CAME

998
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,980
IN.

999
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,980
WE HAVE 18 YESES,

1000
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,980
ONE ABSTENTION, AND ONE NAY.

1001
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,980
CONGRATULATIONS, MR. OLIVER!

1002
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,880
YOU NOW HAVE A POOP PLANT NAMED

1003
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,980
AFTER YOU. WHOO!

1004
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,980
YES!

1005
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,980
THAT IS AMAZING.

1006
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,980
AND HONESTLY, I DO BELIEVE THAT

1007
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,980
I WAS THEIR BEST OPTION.

1008
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,980
WHO ELSE WERE THEY GONNA NAME IT

1009
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:18,980
AFTER?

1010
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,980
NEIL CAVUTO?

1011
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,976
YEAH, HE'S TECHNICALLY FROM
BUT HE ALREADY HAS A SHIT

1012
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,980
DANBURY.
FACTORY NAMED AFTER HIM, AND

1013
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,980
IT'S CALLED "YOUR WORLD WITH

1014
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,980
NEIL CAVUTO."

1015
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,980
SO THE RESOLUTION PASSED,

1016
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,980
ALTHOUGH THE MAYOR DID HAVE ONE

1017
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,980
THAT THEY WOULD MAKE

1018
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,980
IT OFFICIAL "ONLY IF THE

1019
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,980
COMEDIAN IS PHYSICALLY PRESENT

1020
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,980
WHEN THE RIBBON IS CUT."

1021
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,980
WHICH, HONESTLY, IS A PRETTY BIG

1022
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,980
ASK, BECAUSE DANBURY IS AN

1023
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,980
HOUR-AND-A-HALF DRIVE FROM

1024
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,980
NEW YORK CITY.

1025
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,980
AND THE REASON I KNOW THAT IS

1026
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,980
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE

1027
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,980
WE ENTERED THIS VOID, I LEFT.

1028
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,060
AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED.

1029
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,980
YES, I WENT TO

1030
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,980
DANBURY, HOME OF THE

1031
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,980
DANBURY RAILWAY MUSEUM, THE

1032
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,980
SELF-PROCLAIMED WORLD'S TALLEST

1033
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,980
UNCLE SAM, AND NOW, THE SINGLE

1034
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,980
GREATEST SEWAGE PLANT IN THE

1035
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,980
CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES.

1036
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,980
IT WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN

1037
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,980
I'D IMAGINED.

1038
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,980
I'D TAKEN ALL NECESSARY

1039
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,980
PRECAUTIONS.

1040
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,980
NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE

1041
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,980
PANDEMIC, BUT BECAUSE I WAS IN

1042
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,000
DANBURY, CONNECTICUT.

1043
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,980
MY HEART POUNDED AS I PREPARED

1044
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,000
TO MEET MY DESTINY, AND TO A

1045
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,980
LESSER EXTENT, MAYOR BOUGHTON.

1046
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:23,980
MR. OLIVER, WELCOME TO THE

1047
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,976
GREAT CITY OF DANBURY.

1048
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,980
MAYOR MARK, IT IS A
PLEASURE TO BE HERE.

1049
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,980
LET'S DO THIS.

1050
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:29,980
ON BEHALF OF ALL THE CITIZENS

1051
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,980
OF THE CITY OF DANBURY, WE ARE

1052
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,976
PROUD AND HONORED TO NAME THIS

1053
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,980
THE JOHN OLIVER MEMORIAL SEWER
PLANT.

1054
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,980
YOU READY?

1055
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,980
THREE, TWO...

1056
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,980
ONE!

1057
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,980
YES!

1058
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,980
WE DID IT!

1059
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,980
WE DID IT!

1060
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,976
MR. MAYOR, IF IT'S OKAY, I WOULD

1061
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,980
LOVE TO SAY A FEW WORDS.
ABSOLUTELY.

1062
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,980
THERE IS A REASON

1063
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,980
THAT THIS SEWER PLANT MEANS SO

1064
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,980
MUCH TO ME, AND THAT IS THAT IT

1065
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,980
REPRESENTS EVERYTHING THAT WE

1066
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,980
NEED THE MOST RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE

1067
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,980
THINK ABOUT IT.

1068
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,000
THIS PLACE TAKES THE WORST THAT

1069
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,980
HUMANITY CAN PRODUCE AND

1070
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,980
TRANSFORMS IT INTO SOMETHING

1071
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,980
THAT WE CAN LIVE WITH,

1072
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,980
AND NOW MORE THAN EVER, THERE IS

1073
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,980
SOMETHING INSPIRATIONAL IN THAT.

1074
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,980
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THIS

1075
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,980
AWFUL, AWFUL YEAR, WHAT COULD BE

1076
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,980
MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVIDENCE

1077
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,980
THAT IF WE WANT TO,

1078
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,980
WE CAN COME TOGETHER, OVERCOME

1079
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:26,980
OUR DIFFERENCES, AND SORT OUR

1080
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,980
SHIT OUT?

1081
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,980
MR. MAYOR, I COULD NOT BE MORE

1082
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,980
PROUD TO HAVE MY NAME ON YOUR

1083
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,980
SHIT SORTER.

1084
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,980
THANK YOU, DANBURY!

1085
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,980
YOU DIDN'T DANBURY THIS UP.

1086
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,980
NONE OF YOU ARE DANBURYING THIS

1087
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,980
UP.

1088
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,980
THAT'S OUR SHOW!

1089
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,980
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING!

1090
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,980
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK!

1091
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,980
GOOD NIGHT!

1092
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:47,980
YES!

1093
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:48,980
YES!

1094
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,000
IT'S HISTORY!

1095
