1
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,213
Hi there !

2
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:11,223
Before we start tonight,
I wanted to say a couple of things.

3
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,633
As you can see,
we're still not back in our studio.

4
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:17,159
We're not even
where we shot the last show.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,766
We've all been working from home
this week, including me,

6
00:00:19,846 --> 00:00:24,419
so I'm shooting this at home, alone,
with no one else in the room.

7
00:00:24,659 --> 00:00:26,785
So, you won't hear
any laughter tonight.

8
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:30,756
Please don't feel that al all awkward,
it certainly isn't for me.

9
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:33,523
I started comedy
doing stand-up in England,

10
00:00:33,683 --> 00:00:36,290
so I am more than used
to doing jokes to silence.

11
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,697
It's actually
how I'm most comfortable.

12
00:00:38,897 --> 00:00:41,825
We had to shoot this on Saturday,
because it turns out,

13
00:00:41,905 --> 00:00:46,317
everything takes longer to put together
when nobody is allowed near each other.

14
00:00:46,397 --> 00:00:49,686
I want to thank our staff for working
so hard to make this possible.

15
00:00:49,807 --> 00:00:52,373
I'd like to thank you for watching,
and for being patient

16
00:00:52,494 --> 00:00:55,582
while we try and put the best show
we can together for you.

17
00:00:55,943 --> 00:00:58,630
And I'd like to tell coronavirus
to go fuck itself.

18
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:01,758
Who am I kidding ?
Coronavirus doesn't watch this show.

19
00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:06,050
It's more of a Bill Maher fan.
Now, please enjoy our stupid show.

20
00:01:21,932 --> 00:01:23,938
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

21
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:26,344
SEASON VII, EPISODE 6

22
00:01:27,307 --> 00:01:28,711
Hello again !

23
00:01:29,312 --> 00:01:33,122
We're back with a show that's clearly
going to look a little unusual.

24
00:01:33,403 --> 00:01:37,293
As you've seen, the coronavirus
has forced a number of late-night hosts

25
00:01:37,374 --> 00:01:40,302
to record shows from their houses,
and we're no different,

26
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:44,994
as my home is, and this is true,
a blank white void full of sad facts.

27
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:47,200
Where else did you think I lived ?

28
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:50,609
A lot has happened
in the last two weeks,

29
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:53,457
and I'll start with arguably
the least important development.

30
00:01:53,537 --> 00:01:54,981
The last time we spoke,

31
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:59,112
I mentioned the work done
by a very informative TikTok hamster.

32
00:01:59,754 --> 00:02:02,922
Well, I'm thrilled to tell you,
it seems the hamster saw it.

33
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:08,898
A hamster offered more useful public
health advice in one 12-second TikTok

34
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:12,468
than the president has in multiple
addresses to the nation.

35
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:15,235
HAMMY FOR PRESIDENT

36
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,211
Yes ! Yes, yes, yes !
The hamster knows who I am !

37
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:26,144
It might show just how much
the isolation is getting to me

38
00:02:26,224 --> 00:02:28,190
that it's genuinely heartwarming

39
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,198
to experience even a connection
like that right now.

40
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:35,128
And I'd love to say that I would vote
for that hamster for president,

41
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:39,219
but, given that their average life
expectancy is just three years,

42
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:42,428
I'm really gonna have to wait
to find out who its VP pick is.

43
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,478
But Covid-19
continues to rip around the globe.

44
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,323
On Friday, Boris Johnson,

45
00:02:48,604 --> 00:02:52,815
who had bragged about shaking hands
with coronavirus patients,

46
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,021
tested positive for coronavirus.

47
00:02:55,783 --> 00:02:57,428
India's prime minister

48
00:02:57,668 --> 00:03:02,160
has imposed a nationwide lockdown
of its 1.3 billion residents,

49
00:03:02,521 --> 00:03:04,807
with some police
punishing those who disobey

50
00:03:04,888 --> 00:03:07,976
by hitting them with sticks
and making them do squats.

51
00:03:08,457 --> 00:03:11,626
And in Italy, which continues
to be hit incredibly hard,

52
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:15,155
there's been a trend of local leaders
posting videos online

53
00:03:15,476 --> 00:03:18,604
yelling at their citizens
for irresponsibly going outside,

54
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:20,048
and they're incredible.

55
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:24,380
I'm getting news that some would
like to throw graduation parties.

56
00:03:25,302 --> 00:03:28,832
We will send the police
over with flamethrowers.

57
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:34,166
Now you're all marathon runners ?
Everyone asking to run ?

58
00:03:34,727 --> 00:03:36,131
Where do you want to go ?

59
00:03:36,372 --> 00:03:38,658
Explain to me these fucking mobile
hairdressers who go home to home

60
00:03:38,738 --> 00:03:40,583
to style other women's hair.

61
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:42,268
What the fuck is that for ?

62
00:03:42,548 --> 00:03:45,717
Do you understand
that the casket will be closed ?

63
00:03:45,797 --> 00:03:50,129
Who the fuck is supposed to see you
with your hair all done in the casket ?

64
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:54,059
I know that seems extreme,
but he is right.

65
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,631
If your hair is bad, don't panic,
just let it be bad for a while.

66
00:03:58,832 --> 00:04:02,562
Yes, people may see it,
and yes, it'll be embarrassing,

67
00:04:02,762 --> 00:04:04,487
but you will get through it.

68
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:06,412
Trust me. Trust me.

69
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:09,340
Listen, trust me !

70
00:04:10,623 --> 00:04:15,196
As for here in the United States,
the virus continues to spread rapidly.

71
00:04:15,476 --> 00:04:20,089
We have more confirmed coronavirus
cases than any country in the world.

72
00:04:20,249 --> 00:04:22,295
Number one ! Number one !

73
00:04:23,217 --> 00:04:27,789
The president has only recently seemed
to realize the gravity of the situation.

74
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:30,637
As recently as a month ago,
he was saying we have it,

75
00:04:30,757 --> 00:04:32,883
"very much under control", adding,

76
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:35,971
"Stock Market
starting to look very good to me !"

77
00:04:36,894 --> 00:04:40,263
before abruptly shifting gears
to claim that he felt it was a pandemic

78
00:04:40,343 --> 00:04:42,228
long before it was called one,

79
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:46,158
and then, just last week,
making this grand declaration.

80
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,043
I'm a wartime president.

81
00:04:48,164 --> 00:04:51,292
This is a war. A different kind of war
than we've ever had.

82
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:53,779
Yeah, I guess it is different.

83
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:57,428
It's like World War II,
only the enemy is invisible.

84
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,880
Or, like the Vietnam War, only this
time, Trump is actually taking part.

85
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:05,650
And yet, incredibly,
after briefly embracing the need

86
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:09,541
for everyone to engage in social
distancing to flatten the curve,

87
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,388
on Tuesday,
our "wartime president"

88
00:05:12,749 --> 00:05:15,838
seemed to already
be considering giving up the fight

89
00:05:16,078 --> 00:05:18,565
and encouraging
everyone to go back to work.

90
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:23,017
We're opening up this incredible
country because we have to do that.

91
00:05:23,097 --> 00:05:25,062
I'd love to have it open by Easter.

92
00:05:25,744 --> 00:05:29,715
I would love to have it open by Easter.
I will tell you that right now.

93
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:33,846
I would love to have that, it's such
an important day for other reasons

94
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:36,252
but I'll make it
an important day for this too.

95
00:05:36,894 --> 00:05:41,025
Setting aside the "Easter's
an important day for other reasons"

96
00:05:41,185 --> 00:05:43,953
the date he's setting
is just two weeks from now,

97
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:46,720
which is objectively
way too soon !

98
00:05:47,202 --> 00:05:50,169
Although, if you are going
to pick a holiday to break quarantine,

99
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,573
you could do a lot worse

100
00:05:51,653 --> 00:05:56,226
than one honoring the time that Jesus
was supposed to stay inside and didn't.

101
00:05:57,108 --> 00:06:02,001
It's worth taking a moment to appreciate
just how irresponsible that attitude is.

102
00:06:02,683 --> 00:06:06,573
Because we wasted so much time
that we could've spent preparing,

103
00:06:06,774 --> 00:06:08,819
the virus is now widespread.

104
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,432
And thanks to how we have botched
the rollout of testing for the virus,

105
00:06:13,512 --> 00:06:16,480
we still don't know exactly
how bad things are.

106
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:21,814
Strict social distancing measures are
our best shot at slowing this outbreak.

107
00:06:22,335 --> 00:06:26,346
Epidemiologists have said, "If it were
possible to wave a magic wand"

108
00:06:26,507 --> 00:06:29,515
"and make all Americans
freeze in place for 14 days"

109
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:34,127
"while sitting six feet apart,
the epidemic would sputter to a halt."

110
00:06:34,568 --> 00:06:37,656
Now, obviously,
that magic wand is impossible.

111
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:41,467
But, some people aren't even
doing anything close to that.

112
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:44,635
And if you need proof
of just how true that is,

113
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:49,127
just listen to the understandably
exasperated governor of Kentucky.

114
00:06:49,247 --> 00:06:54,421
We have a positive case from someone
who attended a coronavirus party.

115
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:57,469
And this is the part

116
00:06:58,071 --> 00:07:02,002
where, I, the person
that tell everybody to be calm,

117
00:07:02,563 --> 00:07:04,167
have to remain calm myself.

118
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:09,542
Good luck with that, because you just
used the phrase "coronavirus party."

119
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:13,272
And his disgust
at that infuriating term

120
00:07:13,713 --> 00:07:16,881
was perfectly expressed
by his sign language interpreter

121
00:07:17,242 --> 00:07:18,646
who really got across

122
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:22,737
the whole "what the fuck is wrong
with you people ?" sentiment.

123
00:07:23,218 --> 00:07:26,427
Truly, that gesture speaks
for America right now.

124
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:28,833
GIF that woman, immediately.

125
00:07:30,157 --> 00:07:34,127
So, we absolutely should not
be relaxing measures yet,

126
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:38,178
and Trump actually
can't force states to do that.

127
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:41,467
It's up to governors,
some of whom, from both parties,

128
00:07:41,868 --> 00:07:43,633
are taking this very seriously.

129
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:46,641
Unfortunately,
other governors are not.

130
00:07:47,002 --> 00:07:48,526
Ron DeSantis, in Florida,

131
00:07:48,807 --> 00:07:52,456
is still resisting issuing
a statewide stay-at-home order.

132
00:07:52,857 --> 00:07:56,868
And in Texas, Lieutenant Governor
Dan Patrick took things even further,

133
00:07:56,989 --> 00:07:58,914
agreeing with the president

134
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:02,924
that the economic damage of a lockdown
is just too great to bear.

135
00:08:03,285 --> 00:08:06,173
I'm not living
in fear of COVID-19.

136
00:08:06,414 --> 00:08:09,221
What I'm living in fear of is
what's happening to this country.

137
00:08:09,382 --> 00:08:12,470
And you know, Tucker,
no one reached out to me and said,

138
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:14,074
"As a senior citizen,"

139
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:17,644
"are you willing
to take a chance on your survival"

140
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:23,620
"in exchange for keeping
the America that all America loves"

141
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,465
"for your children
and grandchildren ?"

142
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:28,593
And if that's the exchange,
I'm all in.

143
00:08:29,154 --> 00:08:30,839
What are you talking about ?

144
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:36,695
First: if you really want to die
so the U.S. economy can boom,

145
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:39,783
we have a system in place for that,
and it's called Black Friday.

146
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:41,147
Have at it !

147
00:08:41,628 --> 00:08:46,200
Second: we know what's happened
in other countries like Iran and Spain

148
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:48,647
that didn't take
social distancing seriously.

149
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:52,136
They're now home to mass graves
you can see from space,

150
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,746
and ice-skating rinks being used
as makeshift morgues.

151
00:08:56,107 --> 00:09:01,361
I'm in no way minimizing the economic
suffering caused by the shutdown.

152
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:04,609
And we should do everything we can
to mitigate it.

153
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:06,214
This week's stimulus bill

154
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:09,542
is probably only the start
of what is needed for workers.

155
00:09:09,743 --> 00:09:15,559
The idea that people should sacrifice
themselves for the economy is absurd

156
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:19,208
and yet,
it actually gained traction this week,

157
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:22,698
co-signed by a variety
of conservative pundits,

158
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,666
perhaps no more enthusiastically
than this guy.

159
00:09:26,307 --> 00:09:30,639
I contend there are millions
of Americans, just like me,

160
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,249
that will look at their children
and their grandchildren's future,

161
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:39,182
and they will say, "I am not
going to have them a slave to debt."

162
00:09:39,703 --> 00:09:43,192
"I am not going
to erase their future"

163
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:46,000
"because I was afraid to die."

164
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,206
I'm not afraid to die.

165
00:09:48,446 --> 00:09:51,655
I am afraid
that our nation might die,

166
00:09:52,056 --> 00:09:55,104
and that dooms millions
to poverty,

167
00:09:55,666 --> 00:10:00,198
illness, starvation,
and a lack of hope.

168
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:04,730
Let's see if that will trend.

169
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:08,941
Yeah, let's see if that will trend,
you thirsty bitch.

170
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:14,235
But you get that the coronavirus
is not the "Hunger Games", right ?

171
00:10:14,797 --> 00:10:17,965
You can't volunteer yourself
as tribute.

172
00:10:18,086 --> 00:10:20,572
And what you're doing
is actually much darker

173
00:10:20,693 --> 00:10:22,818
you are actively
volunteering others,

174
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:26,468
including people of all ages
with health conditions, to die.

175
00:10:27,551 --> 00:10:31,040
And even if these guys
are okay with letting the coronavirus

176
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:35,292
kill as many people as it feels like
so that the economy's protected...

177
00:10:35,412 --> 00:10:37,177
Which, again, really ?

178
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:41,027
... there are, and I cannot believe
I have to say this,

179
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:45,198
significant drawbacks to hundreds
of thousands of people dying.

180
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,166
Hospitals would be
completely overwhelmed,

181
00:10:48,246 --> 00:10:51,575
which means people suffering
from things that aren't the coronavirus

182
00:10:51,736 --> 00:10:55,225
also wouldn't be able
to get the treatment that they need,

183
00:10:55,305 --> 00:10:57,270
leading to even more people dying,

184
00:10:57,672 --> 00:11:01,041
which, to put this in the only terms
that they seem to care about,

185
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:02,484
also tanks the economy.

186
00:11:03,006 --> 00:11:05,372
So, relaxing social distancing
right now

187
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:08,340
isn't just trading
one bad outcome for another,

188
00:11:08,942 --> 00:11:12,431
it's trading one bad outcome
for both bad outcomes.

189
00:11:13,193 --> 00:11:15,920
It's shitting on your cake,
and choking on it, too.

190
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:18,688
It's critically important

191
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:22,538
for America to be getting a clear,
consistent message

192
00:11:22,979 --> 00:11:26,388
about the severity of the threat
that we're currently facing.

193
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:30,439
That is the only way that we will
be able to manage this virus,

194
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:34,610
contain casualties, and get back
to something resembling normalcy.

195
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:37,618
And floating an Easter end date

196
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:41,228
isn't the only troubling decision
the president has made.

197
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:46,121
Right now, one of the major challenges
facing hospitals across the country

198
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:50,533
is a critical shortage of even basic
personal protective equipment

199
00:11:50,653 --> 00:11:54,263
like masks, respirators,
gloves, and face shields.

200
00:11:54,383 --> 00:11:57,712
Because they are running short,
to an alarming extent.

201
00:11:58,274 --> 00:12:01,282
There are people that literally
are wearing bandanas

202
00:12:01,482 --> 00:12:04,691
because they have nothing better
than that to protect themselves.

203
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:09,423
I've seen people using
the plastic protector sheets

204
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:11,790
to put in as a, as a face mask.

205
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,357
I've seen people
even wearing ski goggles,

206
00:12:14,437 --> 00:12:18,407
Halloween costumes that were masks
to try and cover up parts of their face.

207
00:12:18,568 --> 00:12:21,857
Holy shit. That is terrifying,

208
00:12:22,057 --> 00:12:25,907
both for the medical workers who are
risking their lives to help patients,

209
00:12:25,988 --> 00:12:27,472
but also for the patients.

210
00:12:27,993 --> 00:12:30,119
Imagine being hospitalized
for coronavirus

211
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,686
and then seeing this
walk through the door.

212
00:12:32,806 --> 00:12:34,530
I'd opt out. Yeah, I might die,

213
00:12:34,691 --> 00:12:37,659
but that's better
than whatever this freaky shit is.

214
00:12:38,661 --> 00:12:40,266
And it's not just masks

215
00:12:40,747 --> 00:12:44,116
hospitals also need equipment like
ventilators to help people breathe.

216
00:12:44,317 --> 00:12:46,643
Without enough of them,
people will die.

217
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:50,092
And yet, as recently as Thursday,
Trump was choosing

218
00:12:50,172 --> 00:12:54,103
to not so much address the problem
as try and minimize it.

219
00:12:54,584 --> 00:12:57,271
Watch him dismiss
a request for ventilators

220
00:12:57,351 --> 00:12:59,357
from New York governor
Andrew Cuomo.

221
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:00,961
I have a feeling

222
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:04,370
that a lot of the numbers
that are being said in some areas

223
00:13:04,491 --> 00:13:06,496
are just bigger
than they're going to be.

224
00:13:06,616 --> 00:13:10,226
I don't believe you need
40,000 or 30,000 ventilators.

225
00:13:10,386 --> 00:13:13,715
You go into major hospitals,
sometimes they'll have two ventilators.

226
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:17,686
And, all of a sudden, they're saying,
"Can we order 30,000 ventilators ?"

227
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:20,213
Yeah, that's the problem.

228
00:13:20,814 --> 00:13:24,985
Hospitals don't have that many
ventilators, and there's a pandemic.

229
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:28,194
Trump must be so confused
by fire departments.

230
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:31,402
"You walk into most houses,
they've got some sinks,"

231
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:33,769
"maybe a few cups,
now they're on fire"

232
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:37,338
"and they say they need hundreds
of gallons of water sprayed at them."

233
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:38,702
"I just don't buy it."

234
00:13:39,504 --> 00:13:42,191
And the thing is,
medical equipment shortages

235
00:13:42,392 --> 00:13:45,239
are a problem that Trump
actually could help solve.

236
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:49,170
As a wartime president,
he has a major tool at his disposal:

237
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:51,215
the Defense Production Act.

238
00:13:51,617 --> 00:13:54,544
It enables the federal government
to compel companies

239
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,592
to prioritize the production
of essential supplies.

240
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:01,443
People have been begging him
to use that authority for weeks now,

241
00:14:02,004 --> 00:14:04,972
but he only did
so for the first time on Friday,

242
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:09,304
to force GM, and only GM,
to make ventilators.

243
00:14:09,665 --> 00:14:12,512
And it's not like the DPA
can magic them out of nowhere.

244
00:14:12,593 --> 00:14:15,561
It could still take months
for companies to make them.

245
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,649
That is why it would've been
nice if Trump had invoked it

246
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:24,063
fucking months ago when he saw
it was a pandemic before everyone else.

247
00:14:24,785 --> 00:14:28,234
And there is still so much more
he could be doing with the DPA.

248
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:32,967
It also allows the federal government
to take charge of allocating materials,

249
00:14:33,127 --> 00:14:37,339
like protective equipment, and direct
them to where they're most needed.

250
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,665
And without that happening,
right now,

251
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:43,114
states are competing against
each other in a free-for-all,

252
00:14:43,194 --> 00:14:45,841
as New York governor Andrew Cuomo
will tell you.

253
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:51,617
I am competing with other states,
bidding up other states on the prices.

254
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:56,911
You have manufacturers who sit there
and California offers them $4,

255
00:14:57,753 --> 00:14:59,879
and they say,
"California offered $4,"

256
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,569
I offer $5 and another
state calls in and offers $6.

257
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,614
It's not the way to do it.

258
00:15:05,935 --> 00:15:10,507
No, it isn't.
States obviously shouldn't have to hope

259
00:15:10,588 --> 00:15:14,037
they can outbid each other
for boxes of lifesaving equipment,

260
00:15:14,117 --> 00:15:15,641
while the nation watches.

261
00:15:15,721 --> 00:15:19,973
This is the government's response to
a pandemic, not fucking "Storage Wars".

262
00:15:20,374 --> 00:15:21,657
Again and again,

263
00:15:22,098 --> 00:15:26,390
Trump has failed to give this crisis
the seriousness it requires.

264
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:29,117
And make no mistake:
this is serious.

265
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:32,807
Too often, people discuss this
in bloodless terms,

266
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:37,780
citing the eeriness of empty streets
or closed schools.

267
00:15:38,302 --> 00:15:40,708
But while the streets
may be empty,

268
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:43,877
hospitals are increasingly
bursting at the seams

269
00:15:44,197 --> 00:15:47,566
and the agony this virus causes
is profound.

270
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:50,935
I'm sure you've been reading
the same stories I have,

271
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:54,064
of the woman whose 44-year-old
husband died from this,

272
00:15:54,144 --> 00:15:58,957
or the parents of a 25-year-old
placed in a medically-induced coma.

273
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,724
The health care workers
on the front lines

274
00:16:01,965 --> 00:16:04,051
know that this is just the beginning.

275
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:07,018
Today
is kind of getting worse and worse,

276
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:11,390
we had to get a refrigerated truck

277
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,363
to store the bodies
of patients who are dying.

278
00:16:16,724 --> 00:16:20,775
We are right now scrambling to try
to get a few additional ventilators.

279
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:27,433
I want people to know that
this is bad. People are dying.

280
00:16:28,115 --> 00:16:31,725
We don't have the tools that we need
in the emergency department

281
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:34,051
and in the hospital
to take care of them.

282
00:16:34,532 --> 00:16:40,749
And it's really hard.

283
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,398
Yeah. And this
was always going to be hard,

284
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,767
but it actually didn't need
to be this hard.

285
00:16:48,489 --> 00:16:51,257
And that is why
it's so profoundly disheartening

286
00:16:51,537 --> 00:16:54,185
that we're being led
through this crisis by a man

287
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:57,634
who may be less equipped
to deal with this historical moment

288
00:16:57,714 --> 00:16:59,960
than anybody in recorded history.

289
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,329
Watch what happened
when one reporter pressed him

290
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:05,695
on whether
his Easter deadline was wise.

291
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:08,222
Lawmakers and economists
have said

292
00:17:08,302 --> 00:17:11,310
that reopening the country
by Easter is not a good idea.

293
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:12,955
What is that plan based on ?

294
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:15,241
Just so you understand,
are you ready ?

295
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:18,931
There are certain people that
would like it not to open so quickly.

296
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:22,059
Certain people would like it
to do financially poorly,

297
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:25,949
they think that would be very good
as far as defeating me at the polls.

298
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:30,482
I don't know if that's so,
but I do think it's so...

299
00:17:30,602 --> 00:17:34,853
There are people in your profession
that would like that to happen.

300
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:39,626
For fuck's sake,
no one is thinking about you !

301
00:17:40,147 --> 00:17:43,075
These guidelines
did not revolve around you !

302
00:17:43,557 --> 00:17:47,527
For once, something has come along
that is more toxic and more threatening

303
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:51,016
than this president, and somehow
he's got fucking stage envy.

304
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:56,952
I know this isn't the first time
that I've criticized Donald Trump.

305
00:17:57,193 --> 00:18:01,204
But I can't tell you how much I was
rooting for him to do this better.

306
00:18:01,845 --> 00:18:05,776
Handling a crisis well
is not inherently political.

307
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:08,182
Take Ohio governor Mike DeWine.

308
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:11,511
I disagree with him
on basically everything.

309
00:18:11,832 --> 00:18:14,319
But he's doing
a pretty good job so far.

310
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,453
Also, if I'm honest, I never
really liked Andrew Cuomo before this

311
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:23,102
but I will admit: he's doing admirably
well and I can't wait

312
00:18:23,182 --> 00:18:27,594
to get to the other side of this when
I go back to being irritated by him.

313
00:18:28,597 --> 00:18:31,806
I wish I could honestly say
that we're going to be fine,

314
00:18:32,447 --> 00:18:33,731
but I don't know that.

315
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:36,699
Most of us will,
but not all of us.

316
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,629
The number who won't is very much
up in the air right now.

317
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,958
What is clear is that
a crisis of this magnitude

318
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:47,006
ends up revealing a lot
about who you are as a nation.

319
00:18:47,487 --> 00:18:50,094
And not all
of what's being revealed is good.

320
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:55,148
This virus is exposing some central
vulnerabilities in our medical system,

321
00:18:55,348 --> 00:18:58,316
our political system
and our national psyche.

322
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:02,929
Hospitals that have spent years
trying to operate at maximum efficiency

323
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:06,057
are now watching that efficiency
turn into scarcity.

324
00:19:06,137 --> 00:19:08,865
Our decentralized government,
which can be good,

325
00:19:08,945 --> 00:19:12,474
when local leaders are empowered
to protect their communities,

326
00:19:12,554 --> 00:19:15,683
has also led to states fighting
each other for resources

327
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:19,292
and a patchwork quarantine strategy
that will almost certainly

328
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:21,418
draw out the agony of this crisis.

329
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:25,549
Meanwhile, we're being forced
to confront some of the strangest,

330
00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:28,798
darkest implications
of our national mindset,

331
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,210
in which market-worship threatens
to become a fucking death cult.

332
00:19:34,212 --> 00:19:36,739
But, at the same time,

333
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,031
this virus has exposed some reserves
of real strength in this country.

334
00:19:41,151 --> 00:19:45,563
We've seen extraordinary heroism,
kindness, and ingenuity

335
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,929
from everyone
in essential lines of work,

336
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:50,817
from our grocery store workers,
to those making deliveries

337
00:19:50,937 --> 00:19:53,704
and especially
our medical professionals,

338
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:57,595
who deserve, among other things,
a fucking parade

339
00:19:57,715 --> 00:20:00,322
whenever we're allowed
to have parades again.

340
00:20:00,402 --> 00:20:03,531
And the least we can do right now
is help them.

341
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:08,304
Right now, what we all choose
to do outside of our hospitals

342
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:13,116
has a direct and significant impact
on what happens inside of them.

343
00:20:13,437 --> 00:20:17,007
The more strictly that we all
follow social distancing guidelines,

344
00:20:17,087 --> 00:20:20,777
to the maximum extent that we can,
the easier it will be

345
00:20:20,857 --> 00:20:23,384
for our healthcare workers
to do their jobs.

346
00:20:23,504 --> 00:20:28,036
It is the only way to counteract
an appalling federal response

347
00:20:28,157 --> 00:20:32,248
that inspires a mixture of anger,
bafflement and disgust

348
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:36,499
perhaps best summed up by my
new favorite sign language interpreter,

349
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:41,031
who said, if I may translate:
"What the fuck ?"

350
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:43,558
And now, this.

351
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,889
Yes, We Are Still Doing These.

352
00:20:48,972 --> 00:20:52,863
And Now: Hey, Look !
We're Social Distancing !

353
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,552
As you can see, we are social
distancing ourselves

354
00:20:56,633 --> 00:21:00,242
by keeping at least six feet apart,
I'm sitting at the anchor desk.

355
00:21:00,363 --> 00:21:03,611
And, if it keeps turning,
you'll see, yep, there I am.

356
00:21:03,692 --> 00:21:07,181
Thanks for waking up with us
on this March 19th, I'm Erin Fehlau.

357
00:21:07,261 --> 00:21:08,264
I'm Jamie Staton.

358
00:21:08,344 --> 00:21:12,395
We are very spread apart today.
At least six feet apart.

359
00:21:12,475 --> 00:21:15,242
We're spread out,
trying to stay at least six feet apart.

360
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:18,772
We're all spread out. We're
probably not quite six feet apart.

361
00:21:19,494 --> 00:21:22,542
- We're not sitting six feet apart.
- Why do you think I'm leaning back ?

362
00:21:22,622 --> 00:21:25,590
We're gonna be just speaking in boxes
throughout the show.

363
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,277
It's like a Brady Bunch-style.
Hey, Chernéy.

364
00:21:28,358 --> 00:21:30,563
- Am I going the right...
- It's a little backwards.

365
00:21:30,644 --> 00:21:33,612
You don't like, look at me.
It's kind of the box.

366
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:36,740
I'm going to turn it over
to County Executive Parisi.

367
00:21:39,146 --> 00:21:40,350
Thank you, Janel.

368
00:21:41,673 --> 00:21:45,162
We should stand six feet apart.

369
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:52,943
We should both
stand six feet apart.

370
00:21:55,711 --> 00:21:58,518
You and I. Yeah.

371
00:21:59,761 --> 00:22:04,093
We are demonstrating social
distancing. Thank you very much.

372
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,668
Moving on.
Finally, before we go this week,

373
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:12,235
I'd like to talk briefly
about television:

374
00:22:12,395 --> 00:22:16,647
the one and only method by which you
should let Guy Fieri into your home.

375
00:22:16,807 --> 00:22:19,013
And even then,
it's not a great idea.

376
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:22,863
To deal with the relentless
onslaught of upsetting news

377
00:22:22,943 --> 00:22:26,513
coupled with the crushing boredom
of never getting to leave your house,

378
00:22:26,673 --> 00:22:30,564
you've probably been watching
a clinically disgusting amount of TV.

379
00:22:31,085 --> 00:22:33,010
I know I've binged
so many shows,

380
00:22:33,091 --> 00:22:35,577
I'm worried I'm gonna reach
the end screen of Netflix,

381
00:22:35,657 --> 00:22:39,748
which, I imagine, is just the words
"Look at what you've done to yourself."

382
00:22:40,631 --> 00:22:44,962
It's also impossible to watch things
to take your mind off the coronavirus

383
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:47,329
without
thinking about it anyway.

384
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:50,016
Even small things feel weird now,

385
00:22:50,256 --> 00:22:53,064
like when characters
eat together in public,

386
00:22:53,224 --> 00:22:57,275
or go to work in an office,
or take an intimate boat trip

387
00:22:57,355 --> 00:23:00,243
with their two best friends
to kill their third best friend.

388
00:23:00,363 --> 00:23:04,053
I just hope Tony washed his hands
for two "Happy Birthday"s

389
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,861
after riddling Big Pussy's
enormous body with bullets

390
00:23:06,941 --> 00:23:08,626
and dumping him
into the Atlantic Ocean.

391
00:23:08,746 --> 00:23:11,072
It's the only responsible way
to do that.

392
00:23:11,794 --> 00:23:15,083
If you are worried that you might be
running out of content

393
00:23:15,163 --> 00:23:18,692
that can help you mentally escape,
then you're actually in luck.

394
00:23:19,254 --> 00:23:20,738
I was recently introduced

395
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:24,267
to one of the greatest pieces
of television ever broadcast,

396
00:23:24,348 --> 00:23:26,674
and it begins like this.

397
00:23:27,356 --> 00:23:29,321
Thank you all very much
for being here

398
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:32,730
and welcome to the 1992 edition
of Gallery 33,

399
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:37,382
this annual event when we celebrate
the richness of the artistic talent

400
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:39,829
of the South Central Pennsylvania
area.

401
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:44,562
Okay, first:
is that what 1992 looked like ?

402
00:23:44,963 --> 00:23:49,575
'Cause it looks like 1988 went
to a party where the theme was 1983.

403
00:23:50,056 --> 00:23:54,709
How long did it take 1992 to get
to South Central Pennsylvania ?

404
00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:57,155
Is it currently 2011 down there ?

405
00:23:57,276 --> 00:24:00,645
And, if so, can I please move
to South Central Pennsylvania ?

406
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:02,129
It sounds wonderful !

407
00:24:02,449 --> 00:24:06,179
But still, nothing particularly
out of the ordinary so far there.

408
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,990
Just a local TV art auction.
Nothing to see here.

409
00:24:10,872 --> 00:24:13,800
Apart from this.

410
00:24:14,522 --> 00:24:18,011
The next item, number 71.
It is a watercolor,

411
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:21,420
titled "Surfacing"
by Brian Swords of York.

412
00:24:21,701 --> 00:24:26,554
Brian Swords' work sells absolutely
marvelously here on Gallery 33.

413
00:24:26,714 --> 00:24:29,843
His cartoon characters
are delightful,

414
00:24:30,244 --> 00:24:34,134
and he lets us each imagine whatever
we'd like to with these things.

415
00:24:34,214 --> 00:24:36,380
These two rats are jumping up
out of the water.

416
00:24:36,781 --> 00:24:39,107
Are they ? Are they, though ?

417
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,038
Are they really jumping
out of the water ?

418
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,367
I guess that's the beauty
of Brian Swords' work.

419
00:24:46,447 --> 00:24:48,773
Like all great art,
it's open to interpretation.

420
00:24:48,894 --> 00:24:52,463
That woman might see
two rats jumping out of the water,

421
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:57,757
while I see one rat absolutely
dining out on that other rat.

422
00:24:58,118 --> 00:24:59,562
There's no right answer.

423
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:03,011
But if you are not sure
what side you're on here,

424
00:25:03,573 --> 00:25:07,263
it might help to see another piece
that Swords donated that day.

425
00:25:07,744 --> 00:25:11,193
Brian has sent us another piece that
we know is going to sell like hotcakes.

426
00:25:11,314 --> 00:25:14,642
His work is admired and
collected by lots of people.

427
00:25:14,883 --> 00:25:17,731
It's the kind of a thing where you
just read it for what it says to you.

428
00:25:17,811 --> 00:25:20,659
- Very delightful.
- And everyone enjoys it.

429
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:25,391
It's item number 70, watercolor
"Sheets and Pillowcases".

430
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:29,763
Again, 19 inches wide, 24 high.
The assigned value, $75.

431
00:25:30,244 --> 00:25:33,413
Yes, the assigned value
for "Sheets and Pillowcases"

432
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:36,300
by Brian Swords of York
was $75.

433
00:25:36,421 --> 00:25:38,627
Is that too little ? Too much ?

434
00:25:39,308 --> 00:25:43,159
I guess I'd say: "Fuck yes"
and "Fuck no", respectively.

435
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,327
But I accept I could be
reading too much into this.

436
00:25:46,407 --> 00:25:48,934
Maybe these two rats
are just innocent friends

437
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:52,544
who like to smoke cigarettes
by candlelight and hug each other

438
00:25:52,624 --> 00:25:56,635
in positions that make it impossible
to ignore their visible genitals.

439
00:25:56,755 --> 00:26:00,645
Maybe that's what rat friendship
is all about. I don't know.

440
00:26:00,806 --> 00:26:03,974
I'm not a rat,
despite all evidence to the contrary.

441
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:08,105
I think I know what might
decide this once and for all.

442
00:26:08,346 --> 00:26:11,514
Please bring on item 734.

443
00:26:11,835 --> 00:26:16,648
Item 734 next, a watercolor titled
"The Smell of Wet Fur",

444
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:18,654
by Brian Swords of York.

445
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:21,782
This is another in the continuing
series by Brian Swords

446
00:26:21,862 --> 00:26:28,801
of his amusing drawings and paintings
of rats in unusual circumstances.

447
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,167
In this case
"The Smell of Wet Fur",

448
00:26:31,247 --> 00:26:34,175
two in a hot tub,
obviously enjoying the evening.

449
00:26:35,057 --> 00:26:37,023
What more can possibly be said ?

450
00:26:37,424 --> 00:26:42,076
What more could be said ?
A lot. A lot more can be said.

451
00:26:42,557 --> 00:26:46,488
I could spend a full dissertation
examining the subtle brilliance

452
00:26:46,568 --> 00:26:48,533
of this work alone,
it would be called:

453
00:26:48,614 --> 00:26:53,106
"Ratfucked: Passion and Pathos
in Brian Swords of York's Grey Period"

454
00:26:53,186 --> 00:26:56,916
and I have already written it,
this quarantine has been productive.

455
00:26:57,397 --> 00:27:01,167
But every artist
eventually paints their masterpiece.

456
00:27:01,408 --> 00:27:02,972
And "The Smell of Wet Fur"

457
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:06,421
isn't even Swords of York
at the height of his talents.

458
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:09,911
For that, I give you lot 735.

459
00:27:10,432 --> 00:27:13,199
Item number 735
is a watercolor,

460
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,488
"Stay Up Late"
by Brian Swords of York.

461
00:27:16,729 --> 00:27:18,133
It's 24 by 18 inches.

462
00:27:18,814 --> 00:27:21,782
Brian's work began,
the Biohazard series began

463
00:27:21,863 --> 00:27:25,953
as a statement about brutality
to experimental animals

464
00:27:26,034 --> 00:27:30,125
and has developed into a whole scene
of these rather unusual rats

465
00:27:30,205 --> 00:27:32,651
involved in all types
of normal human activities.

466
00:27:32,812 --> 00:27:37,103
Magnificent. First, kudos
to that camera operator.

467
00:27:37,183 --> 00:27:41,796
That is the best use of a slow pan
I have seen in a long time.

468
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:45,446
But two, why are those rats
"unusual" to you ?

469
00:27:45,887 --> 00:27:49,496
Is it the fact that they have
human torsos but rat heads ?

470
00:27:50,018 --> 00:27:51,943
Or, that they have butts
with two cheeks,

471
00:27:52,023 --> 00:27:54,109
but also tails poking out of them ?

472
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,200
The fact that they have hands with
grasping fingers and opposable thumbs

473
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,603
but only four of them ?

474
00:28:00,085 --> 00:28:02,772
Or, is it that in a world defined
by icy distance,

475
00:28:02,892 --> 00:28:05,539
they aren't afraid to recklessly
love another soul

476
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:07,505
better than most people
could love themselves ?

477
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,149
Because if that's unusual ?

478
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:12,478
Then, buddy,
I don't wanna be usual.

479
00:28:13,841 --> 00:28:16,128
So look, here is the thing.

480
00:28:16,689 --> 00:28:19,136
Did I enjoy stumbling over these clips

481
00:28:19,336 --> 00:28:22,144
and the work
of an undiscovered artistic pioneer ?

482
00:28:22,585 --> 00:28:23,668
Yes.

483
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:27,959
Did it make me feel a little better
after weeks of feeling depressed ?

484
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,411
Yeah, it did.
But it also gave me an idea.

485
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:35,820
Because clearly, we're stuck
for the foreseeable future

486
00:28:35,941 --> 00:28:39,029
doing this show
in a hyperreduced format.

487
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:41,435
That's not really the HBO way.
Is it ?

488
00:28:41,756 --> 00:28:44,764
There's a reason that
"Game of Thrones" wasn't called

489
00:28:44,844 --> 00:28:47,892
"Game of Folding Chairs
and Normal-Sized Lizards".

490
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:50,058
This network never planned

491
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:53,708
on following up "Dragons Fight
a Zombie Army Over Big Ice Wall",

492
00:28:53,788 --> 00:28:57,639
with a single shot of a guy
who hasn't left his home in two weeks.

493
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,644
So, that means two things:

494
00:28:59,844 --> 00:29:02,772
one, we have some budget
left over this week.

495
00:29:03,254 --> 00:29:05,500
And two, it comes at a time

496
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,107
when I just got really interested
in the art market.

497
00:29:08,187 --> 00:29:12,278
Not the entire art market,
of course, mainly just this picture.

498
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:16,569
Let me be clear: I want "Stay Up Late"
by Brian Swords of York.

499
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,861
I know someone bought it
in 1992 for $80.

500
00:29:20,981 --> 00:29:24,430
I also know everything
has its price.

501
00:29:24,871 --> 00:29:27,799
So, I am offering the current owner,
whoever you are,

502
00:29:28,401 --> 00:29:34,377
$1 000, plus a donation of $20 000
to the food bank in your area.

503
00:29:34,698 --> 00:29:38,267
This is real.
So, if you own this masterwork

504
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:40,874
or you know
the lucky person who does,

505
00:29:41,035 --> 00:29:45,687
please e-mail John@
JohnOliverWantsYourRatErotica.com.

506
00:29:46,048 --> 00:29:48,535
A URL that was
disappointingly available.

507
00:29:48,936 --> 00:29:53,388
I want that piece of art hanging
behind me on this wall next week.

508
00:29:53,628 --> 00:29:56,757
And if I don't get it,
I will keep looking for it.

509
00:29:56,997 --> 00:29:58,802
Because this is America.

510
00:29:59,243 --> 00:30:05,179
You can't get a test for Covid-19,
or Purell, or a ventilator,

511
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,826
or a sense of empathy
from the person in charge,

512
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,350
but if you try hard enough,

513
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:13,922
damn it, you can get a picture
of two nude rats

514
00:30:14,163 --> 00:30:17,693
locked in a passionate post-fuck
embrace hanging on your wall.

515
00:30:17,773 --> 00:30:22,265
You have to still be able to get that.
That is what this country is all about.

516
00:30:22,385 --> 00:30:25,473
If we give that up,
we're basically just France.

517
00:30:27,318 --> 00:30:32,051
Please,
find the painting and email me.

518
00:30:33,695 --> 00:30:36,663
Thank you so much for watching.
I hope you're all well.

519
00:30:37,425 --> 00:30:39,431
We'll see you next week.
Good night !

520
00:30:41,516 --> 00:30:42,719
Okay.

521
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,289
Okay.

522
00:30:47,091 --> 00:30:49,738
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

523
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:52,145
