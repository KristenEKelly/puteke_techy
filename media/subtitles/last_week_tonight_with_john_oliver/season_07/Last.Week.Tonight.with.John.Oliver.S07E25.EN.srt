1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,980
HI THERE!

2
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:34,980
WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

3
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,980
TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK VOID.

4
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,980
THINK OF IT LIKE ANTARCTICA,

5
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,880
IT'S A BLINDINGLY WHITE EXPANSE

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,996
OCCASIONALLY INTERRUPTED
BY A SINGLE WELL-DRESSED BIRD.

7
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,980
AND IT HAS BEEN A GENUINELY

8
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,980
EXTRAORDINARY WEEK FOR

9
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,980
THE WHITE HOUSE.

10
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,980
A SIGN OF JUST HOW CRAZY THINGS

11
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,980
GOT IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE TIME

12
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,980
TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT

13
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,980
TRUMP REPORTEDLY PAID INCOME TAX

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,980
RANGING FROM THE HIGH THREE

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,980
FIGURES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO

16
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,980
ZERO FIGURES FOR MULTIPLE YEARS,

17
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,760
OR THE FACT THAT HIS WIFE WAS

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,980
CAUGHT ON TAPE ESSENTIALLY

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,980
SAYING "FUCK CHRISTMAS,"

20
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,980
OR EVEN THIS MOMENT IN TUESDAY'S

21
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,980
CATASTROPHIC DEBATE.

22
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,980
THE LOW POINT OF THE DEBATE,

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,980
AND POSSIBLY OF TRUMP'S ENTIRE

24
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:09,980
CAMPAIGN, WAS WHEN THE PRESIDENT

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,980
REFUSED TO CONDEMN

26
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,980
WHITE SUPREMACISTS.

27
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:14,980
ARE YOU WILLING TONIGHT TO

28
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,997
CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND
MILITIA GROUPS?

29
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:18,980
SURE.

30
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,980
AND TO SAY THAT THEY NEED

31
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,980
TO STAND DOWN AND NOT ADD

32
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,980
TO THE VIOLENCE IN A NUMBER OF

33
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,980
THESE CITIES.

34
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,980
I'M WILLING TO DO ANYTHING,

35
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:26,980
I WANT TO SEE PEACE.

36
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,980
WELL, THEN DO IT, SIR.

37
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,980
DO IT, SAY IT.

38
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,980
YOU WANT TO CALL THEM...

39
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,976
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO CALL THEM?

40
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:32,980
GIVE ME A NAME.

41
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,980
WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND

42
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,980
RIGHT-WING MILITIAS.

43
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,980
PROUD BOYS.

44
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,980
PROUD BOYS, STAND BACK AND

45
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,980
STAND BY.

46
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,976
THAT DOES NOT GET

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,960
ANY EASIER TO WATCH.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,976
BECAUSE THE QUESTION WAS
"DO YOU CONDEMN

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,980
WHITE SUPREMACISTS?"
TO WHICH TRUMP RESPONDED BY

50
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,980
ESSENTIALLY RALLYING THEM.

51
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,940
AND IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE ANOTHER

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,980
DEBATE QUESTION THAT EASY, OR AN

53
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,980
ANSWER THAT HORRIBLE, ASIDE FROM

54
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,980
MAYBE CHRIS WALLACE ASKING "HOW

55
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,980
MANY FINGERS AM I HOLDING UP?"

56
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,980
AND TRUMP RESPONDING, "HITLER

57
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,980
HAD SOME REALLY GOOD IDEAS."

58
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,980
BUT OBVIOUSLY, THE BIGGEST NEWS

59
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,980
OF THE WEEK CAME EARLY FRIDAY

60
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,980
MORNING, WHEN TRUMP REVEALED

61
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,980
THAT HE AND MELANIA HAD TESTED

62
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,980
POSITIVE FOR THE CORONAVIRUS.

63
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,980
IT WAS NEWS THAT FELT BOTH

64
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,980
SHOCKING AND UTTERLY INEVITABLE,

65
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,980
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT JUST THREE

66
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,980
DAYS EARLIER, HE'D STOOD ON

67
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,980
A DEBATE STAGE AND, WHEN ASKED

68
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,976
ABOUT WHETHER HE'D DOWNPLAYED

69
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,020
THE EFFICACY OF MASKS,

70
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,980
I MEAN, I HAVE A MASK RIGHT

71
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,980
HERE.

72
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,980
I PUT A MASK ON, YOU KNOW, WHEN

73
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,980
I THINK I NEED IT.

74
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,980
WHEN NEEDED, I WEAR MASKS.

75
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,980
OKAY.

76
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,980
LET ME ASK...

77
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,976
I DON'T... I DON'T WEAR

78
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,980
A MASK LIKE HIM.
EVERY TIME YOU SEE HIM, HE'S GOT

79
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,980
A MASK.

80
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,980
HE COULD BE SPEAKING 200 FEET

81
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,980
AWAY FROM HIM, HE SHOWS UP

82
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,976
WITH THE BIGGEST MASK I'VE EVER

83
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,980
SEEN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

84
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,980
BIDEN WEARS A MASK IN SITUATIONS

85
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,000
WHERE IT'S DANGEROUS NOT TO.

86
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,980
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT TRUMP

87
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,980
WOULD BE LIKE STANDING NEXT

88
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,980
TO A BEEKEEPER.

89
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,980
"I DON'T WEAR A BEEKEEPER SUIT

90
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,980
LIKE HIM.

91
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,980
EVERY TIME YOU SEE HIM, HE'S

92
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,980
WEARING A BEEKEEPER SUIT.

93
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,980
NOT ME, BECAUSE I'M SMART AND

94
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,980
STRONG.

95
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,980
THIS WHOLE BEE THING IS A HOAX

96
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,980
ANYWAY."

97
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,980
LOOK, OBVIOUSLY, THE PRESIDENT

98
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,980
HAVING THE CORONAVIRUS IS

99
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,980
A VERY BIG DEAL.

100
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,980
AND WE'RE RECORDING THIS

101
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,980
ON SATURDAY, SO WHO KNOWS WHAT'S

102
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,980
HAPPENED OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS.

103
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,980
WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT SO FAR,

104
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,980
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS HANDLED

105
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,980
THE SITUATION TERRIBLY.

106
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,980
FIRST, THE NEWS ONLY CAME OUT

107
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,980
AFTER REPORTERS DISCOVERED THAT

108
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,980
ONE OF TRUMP'S CLOSEST AIDES,

109
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,980
HOPE HICKS, WHO'D TRAVELED WITH

110
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,980
TRUMP TO THE DEBATE, HAD TESTED

111
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,980
POSITIVE.

112
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,980
PROMPTING THE OBVIOUS QUESTION

113
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,980
OF WHEN THE PRESIDENT LEARNED

114
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,997
HE'D BEEN EXPOSED, AND WHAT HE'D
DONE ABOUT IT, AND THE ANSWERS

115
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:24,980
THERE WEREN'T GREAT.

116
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,980
THE WHITE HOUSE KNEW ON

117
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,980
THURSDAY MORNING THAT HOPE HICKS

118
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,980
HAD SYMPTOMS OF CORONAVIRUS, BUT

119
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,980
DESPITE THAT, THE PRESIDENT WENT

120
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,980
AHEAD WITH PLANS TO TRAVEL

121
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,980
TO NEW JERSEY FOR A FUNDRAISER

122
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,980
ANYWAY.

123
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,980
IT WAS DEEMED SAFE FOR

124
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,980
THE PRESIDENT TO GO.

125
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,980
HE SOCIALLY DISTANCED, IT WAS AN

126
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,940
OUTDOOR EVENT, AND IT WAS DEEMED

127
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,980
SAFE BY WHITE HOUSE OPERATIONS.

128
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,980
OKAY, NORMALLY I'D

129
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,980
CRITICIZE THE WHITE HOUSE

130
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,980
OPERATIONS TEAM FOR EITHER

131
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,980
HAVING NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT IS

132
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,980
AND ISN'T SAFE OR JUST NOT

133
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,980
CARING, BUT GIVEN THAT THERE'S

134
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,980
A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE THAT MOST

135
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,980
OF THEM HAVE COVID NOW,

136
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,980
I GUESS I'LL JUST SAY,

137
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,980
"FEEL BETTER, GUYS."

138
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,980
AND SO MANY OF THE DECISIONS

139
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,980
TRUMP AND THOSE AROUND HIM MADE

140
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,980
THIS WEEK NOW LOOK APPALLING

141
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,980
IN HINDSIGHT... FROM HIS FAMILY

142
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,980
REFUSING TO WEAR MASKS

143
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,980
AT TUESDAY'S DEBATE, TO FAILING

144
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,980
TO NOTIFY ANYONE ON THE BIDEN

145
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,980
TEAM THAT THEY MAY HAVE BEEN

146
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,980
EXPOSED, TO THE FACT THAT

147
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,980
THE FUNDRAISER HE ATTENDED

148
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,700
JUST BEFORE TESTING POSITIVE

149
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,980
WAS A FUCKING BUFFET!

150
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,980
BUT MAYBE THE EVENT THAT LOOKS

151
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,980
THE WORST TOOK PLACE LAST

152
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,980
WEEKEND.

153
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,980
THERE IS ALSO SOME FOCUS

154
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,980
ON THIS EVENT THAT WAS HELD

155
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,980
AT THE WHITE HOUSE LAST SATURDAY

156
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,980
WHEN THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED HIS

157
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,980
PICK FOR THE SUPREME COURT,

158
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,980
AMY CONEY BARRETT.

159
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,980
WE KNOW THAT UTAH SENATOR

160
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,980
MIKE LEE, WHO WAS AT THAT EVENT,

161
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,980
THE PRESIDENT OF NOTRE DAME, WHO

162
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,980
WAS ALSO AT THAT EVENT, HAVE

163
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,980
BOTH TESTED POSITIVE NOW FOR

164
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,980
THE CORONAVIRUS.

165
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,980
OBVIOUSLY, WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS

166
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,980
WERE AT THAT EVENT, AND SO THERE

167
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,980
IS THE POTENTIAL THAT ALL OF

168
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,980
THIS BEGAN THERE.

169
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,980
YES, MUCH LIKE

170
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:46,980
THE SLEW OF UTTERLY HORRIFYING

171
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,980
SUPREME COURT RULINGS OVER

172
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,980
THE NEXT FEW DECADES, IT SEEMS

173
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,980
WE MAY LOOK BACK ON LAST

174
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,980
SATURDAY'S WHITE HOUSE EVENT AND

175
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,980
SAY, "ALL OF THIS BEGAN THERE."

176
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,980
AND THERE IS SOMETHING UTTERLY

177
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,980
INFURIATING ABOUT WATCHING THEM

178
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,980
HUGGING EACH OTHER WHEN MANY IN

179
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,980
THIS COUNTRY HAVEN'T SEEN THEIR

180
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,980
FAMILIES FOR MONTHS OR HAVE DIED

181
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,980
ALONE IN A HOSPITAL!

182
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,980
AND IT'S NOT JUST THAT THEY'RE

183
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,980
PUTTING THEMSELVES AT RISK...

184
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,980
MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT'S THAT

185
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,980
THEY'RE RISKING INFECTING

186
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,980
OTHERS.

187
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,980
THE THING ABOUT A HIGHLY

188
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,980
CONTAGIOUS VIRUS IS, YOUR

189
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,980
RECKLESSNESS COULD END UP

190
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,980
KILLING SOMEONE YOU NEVER MEET.

191
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,980
AND THEY'RE STILL DOING IT!

192
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,980
BILL BARR, WHO WAS AT THAT EVENT

193
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,980
AND MAY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED,

194
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,980
IS CHOOSING NOT TO QUARANTINE

195
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,980
HIMSELF.

196
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,980
MEANWHILE, FOUR REPUBLICANS WHO

197
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,980
TRAVELED WITH TRUMP THIS WEEK

198
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,980
NOT ONLY DIDN'T QUARANTINE,

199
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,980
THEY SHOWED UP TO THE HOUSE

200
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,980
TO VOTE IN PERSON, THEN THREE

201
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,980
OF THEM TOOK A DELTA FLIGHT

202
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,980
HOME!

203
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,980
THE FRUSTRATING THING IS,

204
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,980
REPUBLICANS SEEM TO BE HANDLING

205
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,980
THIS OUTBREAK THE WAY THEY'VE

206
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,980
HANDLED THE WHOLE PANDEMIC, WITH

207
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,980
A MIXTURE OF DENIALISM, HUBRIS,

208
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,980
AND TREATING IT MORE AS

209
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,980
A P.R CRISIS THAN ONE OF

210
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,980
PUBLIC HEALTH, WHICH HAS HAD

211
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,980
HUGE KNOCK-ON EFFECTS.

212
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,980
AND THERE MIGHT BE NO BETTER

213
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,980
EXAMPLE OF THIS THAN THIS TRUMP

214
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,980
SUPPORTER... OUTSIDE THE

215
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,980
HOSPITAL TRUMP WAS RUSHED TO ON

216
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,980
FRIDAY... EXPLAINING WHY HE

217
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,980
WASN'T WEARING A MASK.

218
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,000
WELL, I'M YOUNG, AND I'M NOT

219
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,980
AT RISK FOR COVID, SO WITH THE

220
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,980
SURVIVAL RATES THAT WE'VE SEEN,

221
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,980
IT'S FRANKLY HYSTERIA WHAT WE'RE

222
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,980
SEEING WITH COVID, SO.

223
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,000
ARE YOU EVER CONCERNED YOU

224
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,980
COULD POSSIBLY BE ASYMPTOMATIC
AND PASS IT TO SOMEONE ELSE?

225
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,980
YES, I DO HAVE THOSE

226
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,980
CONCERNS, BUT I DON'T BUY INTO

227
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,980
THE FEARMONGERING.

228
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,980
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU

229
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,980
TALKING ABOUT?

230
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,980
YOU'RE ONLY THERE BECAUSE THE

231
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,980
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

232
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,980
IS IN THE BUILDING BEHIND YOU

233
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,980
WITH A PRETTY BAD CASE OF

234
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,980
FEARMONGERING.

235
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,980
AND AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO SHOUT

236
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,980
AT THAT GUY, YOU HAVE TO

237
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,980
REMEMBER THAT THIS

238
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,980
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN

239
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,980
DOWNPLAYING THE VIRUS SO MUCH

240
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,980
AND FOR SO LONG, THAT FOR

241
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,980
TRUMP'S DIE-HARD SUPPORTERS, ANY

242
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,980
SORT OF CONCERN ISN'T SEEN AS

243
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,980
A SENSIBLE PRECAUTION, IT'S SEEN

244
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,980
AS FEARMONGERING.

245
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,980
BUT FEAR IS NOT A BAD THING.

246
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,980
IT'S WHAT STOPS YOU FROM

247
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,980
CHOPPING YOUR HAND OFF WITH

248
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,980
A MEAT CLEAVER, OR PETTING

249
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,980
AN ANGRY DOG, OR CROSSING

250
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,980
A BUSY STREET WITHOUT LOOKING.

251
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,980
AND THIS WEEK, MORE THAN EVER,

252
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,980
PROVES THAT IN THE MIDST OF

253
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,980
A PANDEMIC, WHEN YOU ACT WITHOUT

254
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,980
CAUTION, YOU CANNOT EXPECT

255
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,980
THE VIRUS TO SIMPLY "STAND BACK

256
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,980
AND STAND BY."

257
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,020
AND NOW THIS.

258
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,976
AND NOW...

259
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,960
NEWSCASTERS TRYING TO HAVE FUN

260
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,980
WITH WHAT MONTH IT IS.

261
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,980
IT IS THURSDAY, OCTOBER 1ST.

262
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,976
BIG DAY.

263
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,980
HAPPY OCTOBER. I KNOW, RIGHT?

264
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,976
WE MADE IT TO SPOOKY SEASON.

265
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,960
WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE.

266
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,976
SPOOKY SEASON IS HERE.

267
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,980
WELL, GUYS, NOW THAT IS
OFFICIALLY OCTOBER, WE HAVE

268
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,976
SPOOKY SEASON RIGHT AROUND

269
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,580
THE CORNER.
I WATCHED "HOCUS-POCUS"

270
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,980
LAST NIGHT. I AM ALL IN.

271
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,520
IT'S OFFICIALLY SPOOKY

272
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,980
SEASON, SO WHY NOT GO TO HELL?

273
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,980
HELL, MICHIGAN.

274
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,980
IT'S OCTOBER, MARKS THE

275
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,980
BEGINNING OF SPOOKY SEASON.

276
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,980
WE ARE ENTERING SPOOKY

277
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,980
SEASON.

278
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,980
FOR MANY, THE BEGINNING

279
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,980
OF OCTOBER IS ALSO THE SIGN OF

280
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,980
SPOOKY SEASON.

281
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,980
ALTHOUGH, THE PANDEMIC IS

282
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,980
CHANGING THE WAY WE DO HALLOWEEN

283
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,020
AND VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING.

284
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,980
MOVING ON.

285
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,980
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

286
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,980
THE 2020 ELECTION... AMONG OTHER

287
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,980
THINGS, THE INSPIRATION FOR THE

288
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,980
SINGLE BEST VOTING PSA THE WORLD

289
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,976
HAS EVER SEEN.

290
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,980
DO YOU KNOW WHO ELECTS THE D.A.?

291
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,976
WE DO.

292
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,960
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO VOTE.

293
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,976
CAN'T MAKE IT RAIN IF YOU'RE
LOCKED UP ON SOME BULLSHIT.

294
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,980
WANT TO END CASH BAIL?

295
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,980
WELL, THEN, VOTE FOR THE

296
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,980
SHERIFFS AND COUNTY OFFICIALS

297
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,980
THAT FEEL THE SAME WAY YOU DO.

298
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,980
BUT YOU TALKIN' ABOUT, "OH,

299
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,980
THEY GONNA PICK WHO THEY GONNA

300
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,980
PICK, SHORTY."

301
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,976
FERGUSON JUST ELECTED THEIR

302
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,980
FIRST BLACK MAYOR.
YOU KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENED?

303
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,980

304
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,980

EXCELLENT.

309
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,940
THEY HIT PROSECUTORS, CASH BAIL,

310
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,980
SHERIFFS, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF

311
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,980
DOWN BALLOT RACES... ALL

312
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,980
SUBJECTS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

313
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,980
BEFORE... BUT DID IT IN

314
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,980
LESS TIME AND MORE

315
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,980
ENTERTAININGLY, WHILE ALSO

316
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,980
PROVIDING A MUCH BETTER

317
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,980
"GET OUT THE VOTE" MESSAGE

318
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,980
THAN ANYONE CURRENTLY WORKING

319
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,980
FOR JOE BIDEN.

320
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,980
I HAVE NO NOTES.

321
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,980
AND EVEN THOUGH TRUMP IS

322
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,980
CURRENTLY IN THE HOSPITAL WITH

323
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,980
CORONAVIRUS, AND EVERYTHING'S UP

324
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,980
IN THE AIR RIGHT NOW... WE'RE

325
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,980
TAPING THIS ON SATURDAY, SO WHO

326
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,980
KNOWS WHAT THINGS ARE LIKE

327
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,980
WHENEVER YOU'RE WATCHING THIS...

328
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,980
WE DO NEED TO TALK ABOUT

329
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,980
THIS ELECTION, BECAUSE IT'S

330
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,980
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

331
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,980
MORE THAN THREE MILLION VOTES

332
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,980
HAVE ALREADY BEEN CAST.

333
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,980
AND YET, TRUMP AND HIS

334
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,980
SUPPORTERS HAVE ENGAGED

335
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,980
IN A DELIBERATE CAMPAIGN

336
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,980
TO UNDERMINE THE PROCESS.

337
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,980
FOR MONTHS NOW, TRUMP HAS

338
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,980
BEEN QUESTIONING WHETHER HE WILL

339
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,980
EVEN LEAVE.

340
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,000
IN GENERAL, NOT TALKING ABOUT

341
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,980
NOVEMBER, ARE YOU A GOOD LOSER?

342
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,980
I'M NOT A GOOD LOSER.

343
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,980
I DON'T LIKE TO LOSE.

344
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,980
I DON'T LOSE TOO OFTEN.

345
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,980
I DON'T LIKE TO LOSE.

346
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,980
BUT ARE YOU GRACIOUS?

347
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,980
YOU DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU SEE.

348
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,980
IT DEPENDS.

349
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,980
I THINK MAIL-IN VOTING IS... IS

350
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,980
GOING TO RIG THE ELECTION.

351
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,980
I REALLY DO.

352
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,980
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT YOU

353
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,980
MIGHT NOT ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF

354
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,980
THE ELECTION?

355
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,980
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO SEE.

356
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,980
YEAH, HE HAS TO SEE.

357
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,980
AND BY THAT, OF COURSE, HE MEANS

358
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,980
HE HAS TO SEE IF HE WINS.

359
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,980
BECAUSE IF HE DOESN'T, HE'LL

360
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,980
REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE RESULTS.

361
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,980
DEEP DOWN, YOU KNOW THERE IS

362
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,980
NO SCENARIO IN WHICH TRUMP

363
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,820
LOSES, BUT DECIDES THE PROCESS

364
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,980
WAS LEGIT, AND THEN SHOWS UP

365
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,980
TO BIDEN'S HOUSE WITH

366
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,980
A CONGRATULATORY ICE CREAM CAKE.

367
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,976
THAT IS JUST NOT GOING

368
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,980
TO HAPPEN.
AND LOOK, GIVEN THE FREQUENCY

369
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,980
WITH WHICH ONE PARTY TRIED TO

370
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,980
DESTABILIZE THIS ELECTION, WE

371
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,980
THOUGHT TONIGHT, IT MIGHT BE A

372
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,980
GOOD IDEA TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE

373
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,820
WAYS THEY'VE TRIED TO DO THAT,

374
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,980
AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY,

375
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,980
HOW WE CAN HELP PREVENT THAT

376
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,980
FROM HAPPENING.

377
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,980
AND FIRST, LET'S ACKNOWLEDGE

378
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,980
THERE IS NOTHING NEW IN

379
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,340
REPUBLICANS ATTEMPTING

380
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,980
TO DEPRESS TURNOUT.

381
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,980
THEY'VE DONE IT FOR YEARS,

382
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,980
SOMETIMES WITH A VENEER OF

383
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,980
"FIGHTING VOTER FRAUD," AND

384
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,980
TACTICS LIKE STRICT VOTER I.D.

385
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,980
LAWS AND PURGING VOTER ROLLS.

386
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,980
BUT SOMETIMES, THEY'VE JUST SAID

387
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,980
IT OUT LOUD.

388
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,980
I DON'T WANT EVERYBODY

389
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,980
TO VOTE.

390
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,980
ELECTIONS ARE NOT WON BY

391
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,980
A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE, THEY NEVER

392
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,980
HAVE BEEN FROM THE BEGINNING OF

393
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,980
OUR COUNTRY, AND THEY ARE NOT

394
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,980
NOW.

395
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,976
AS A MATTER OF FACT, OUR

396
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,980
LEVERAGE IN THE ELECTIONS,
QUITE CANDIDLY, GOES UP AS

397
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,980
THE VOTING POPULACE GOES DOWN.

398
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,980
NOW THAT MAN IS

399
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,580
PAUL WEYRICH... A FOUNDING

400
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,980
FATHER OF MODERN CONSERVATISM,

401
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,980
AND THE COFOUNDER OF

402
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,976
RIGHT-WING GROUPS LIKE

403
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,960
THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION AND

404
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,980
THE MORAL MAJORITY.

405
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,980
ALTHOUGH, I'M NOT SURE YOU CAN

406
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,980
REALLY KEEP CALLING IT A

407
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,980
"MORAL MAJORITY," WHEN

408
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,980
THE PHILOSOPHY OF ONE OF YOUR

409
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,980
FOUNDERS IS "IMMORALLY SUPPRESS

410
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,980
THE MAJORITY OF VOTERS."

411
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,980
BUT THE FACT IS THAT THIS YEAR,

412
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,980
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS

413
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,980
TURBOCHARGING EFFORTS TO MESS

414
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,980
WITH THE VOTE.

415
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,980
FOR A START, THE PRESIDENT HAS

416
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,980
REPEATEDLY INSTRUCTED HIS

417
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,980
SUPPORTERS TO GO TO POLLING

418
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,980
PLACES AND MONITOR FOR INCIDENTS

419
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,980
OF FRAUD.

420
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,980
WATCH THOSE BALLOTS.

421
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,980
I DON'T LIKE IT.

422
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,980
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE A DEMOCRAT

423
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,980
GOVERNOR, YOU HAVE ALL THESE

424
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,980
DEMOCRATS WATCHING THAT STUFF.

425
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,000
BE POLL WATCHERS WHEN YOU GO

426
00:11:34,121 --> 00:11:34,997
THERE.

427
00:11:35,021 --> 00:11:36,980
WATCH ALL THE THIEVING AND

428
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,980
STEALING AND ROBBING THEY DO.

429
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,980
YEAH, THAT'S NOT GOOD.

430
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,980
BECAUSE HE'S NOT DESCRIBING

431
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,980
OFFICIAL POLL WATCHERS THERE,

432
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,976
PEOPLE WHOSE ROLE IS TO MONITOR

433
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,960
ELECTIONS SO EVERYONE IS TREATED

434
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,980
FAIRLY. HE'S ESSENTIALLY GIVING

435
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,980
HIS SUPPORTERS THE GREEN LIGHT

436
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,980
TO WALK INTO POLLING PLACES AND

437
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,980
START PLAYING FUCKING BALLOT

438
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,980
BATMAN.

439
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,980
AND IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVEN'T

440
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,980
HAD PROBLEMS WITH AGGRESSIVE

441
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,980
POLL-WATCHING IN THE PAST.

442
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,980
IN 1981, THE YEAR AFTER WEYRICH

443
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,980
SPOKE, THE RNC FORMED A FAKE

444
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,980
NATIONAL BALLOT SECURITY TASK

445
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,980
FORCE AND HIRED ARMED OFF-DUTY

446
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,980
POLICEMEN TO PATROL LARGELY

447
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,980
BLACK AND HISPANIC PRECINCTS

448
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,980
IN NEW JERSEY, WHERE THEY

449
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,980
PROMINENTLY DISPLAYED REVOLVERS

450
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,980
AND ARMBANDS WITH

451
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,980
THE TASK FORCE'S NAME.

452
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,980
AND JUST, AS A GENERAL RULE,

453
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,980
REVOLVERS AND ARMBANDS AT

454
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,980
A POLLING SITE IS NEVER

455
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,980
A GREAT LOOK, CONSIDERING THAT

456
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,980
THE LITERAL DEFINITION OF AN

457
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,980
ACTUAL NAZI IS SOMEONE WITH GUNS

458
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,980
AND ARMBANDS WHO THREATENS

459
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,980
THE SAFETY OF THE POLLS.

460
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,980
THAT INCIDENT CAUSED SUCH

461
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,980
AN OUTCRY, THE DEMOCRATS SUED,

462
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,980
AND THE RNC ENTERED INTO A

463
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,980
CONSENT DECREE PLEDGING TO

464
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:34,980
STOP SUCH BEHAVIOR IN THE

465
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,980
FUTURE, WHICH IS GREAT.

466
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,980
UNFORTUNATELY, A JUDGE LIFTED

467
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,980
THAT CONSENT DECREE IN 2018.

468
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,976
BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING

469
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,960
REPUBLICANS HAVE DONE OVER

470
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,980
THE LAST FEW YEARS,

471
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,980
IT'S REGAIN A NATION'S TRUST.

472
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,980
AND THE THING IS, EVEN IF TRUMP

473
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,980
SUPPORTERS DON'T SHOW UP TO

474
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,980
HARASS VOTERS, THERE ARE PLENTY

475
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,980
OF OTHER REASONS IN-PERSON

476
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,980
VOTING COULD BE TRICKY THIS

477
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,980
YEAR.

478
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,980
THANKS TO THE PANDEMIC, MANY

479
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,980
POLL WORKERS ARE CHOOSING TO

480
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,980
STAY AT HOME, AND MANY POLLING

481
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,980
SITES MAY BE CLOSED.

482
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,980
WHICH COULD CAUSE REAL PROBLEMS,

483
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,980
ESPECIALLY FOR LATINO AND BLACK

484
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,980
VOTERS, WHO ALREADY FACE

485
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,980
SUBSTANTIALLY LONGER WAIT TIMES

486
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,000
THAN WHITE VOTERS.

487
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,980
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THE IMPACT

488
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,980
OF FEWER POLLING PLACES IN THIS

489
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,980
YEAR'S PRIMARIES, BECAUSE WATCH

490
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,980
THIS GEORGIA VOTER SHOW YOU HOW

491
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,980
LONG HIS LINE WAS.

492
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,980
SEVEN HOURS, 45 MINUTES, AND

493
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,980
13 SECONDS, IT TOOK FOR ME TO

494
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,980
VOTE IN FULTON COUNTY, GEORGIA.

495
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,980
AS SOON AS I SAW THE LINE,

496
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,980
I HIT THE STOPWATCH ON MY PHONE.

497
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,980
I SPENT THE FIRST COUPLE HOURS

498
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,980
LISTENING TO THE NEW

499
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,980
RUN THE JEWELS ALBUM.

500
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,980
AND THEN I ENDED UP LISTENING

501
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,980
TO THE ENTIRE DISCOGRAPHY.

502
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,980
AND THEN I STARTED WATCHING

503
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,980
SEASON 8 OF

504
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,980
"CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM."

505
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,100
THAT'S FIVE HOURS.

506
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,996
IT WAS 1:00 IN THE MORNING AND
SOMEBODY WAS LIKE, "HEY, Y'ALL

507
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,980
REMEMBER WE CAME TO VOTE

508
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,100
YESTERDAY, RIGHT?"

509
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,980
HOLY SHIT.

510
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,980
CAN YOU IMAGINE WATCHING

511
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,980
FIVE HOURS OF STREAMING VIDEO

512
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,980
ON YOUR PHONE WHILE STANDING

513
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,980
IN LINE TO VOTE?

514
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,980
YOU CAN'T?

515
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,980
WHAT IF EACH VIDEO WAS LESS THAN

516
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,980
TEN MINUTES AT A TIME, WITH

517
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,980
COMMERCIALS?

518
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,980
STILL NO?

519
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,980
HOW ABOUT IF YOU COULD WATCH

520
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,980
THE SHOW VERTICALLY OR

521
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,980
HORIZONTALLY?

522
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,980
NO AGAIN?

523
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,980
OKAY, SORRY, QUIBI, I GUESS IT'S

524
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,980
YOU'RE A BAD IDEA.

525
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,980
BAD IDEA!

526
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,976
I HATE TO BREAK THIS TO

527
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,980
YOU $2 BILLION IN.
YOU KNOW WHAT... WHO KNOWS?

528
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,980
MAYBE ONE OF YOUR SHOWS WILL

529
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,976
BE A HIT, LIKE THE ONE ABOUT

530
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,960
FLIPPING HOUSES WHERE GRISLY

531
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,980
MURDERS TOOK PLACE. REALLY?

532
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,980
AW, COME ON.

533
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,980
STRANGER THINGS HAVE HAPPENED.

534
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:34,000
AFTER ALL, HBO MAX STILL EXISTS,

535
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,976
AND THEY CHARGE $14.9...

536
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,980
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
YOU ARE COMPLETELY RIGHT.

537
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,980
I CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT.

538
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,980
AND WHEN YOU TAKE ALL THIS

539
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,980
TOGETHER... THE LONG LINES,

540
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,980
THE POSSIBILITY OF HARASSMENT,

541
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,980
AND THE LOOMING THREAT OF

542
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,980
THE PANDEMIC... IT'S NO WONDER

543
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,980
THAT AROUND 40% OF AMERICANS SAY

544
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,980
THEY'LL BE VOTING BY MAIL THIS

545
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,980
YEAR.

546
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,980
BUT THAT HAS ACTUALLY OPENED UP

547
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,980
A WHOLE NEW FRONT IN

548
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,980
REPUBLICANS' WAR ON

549
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,980
DEMOCRATIC VOTES.

550
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,980
AND TO UNDERSTAND WHY, IT HELPS

551
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,980
TO UNDERSTAND ONE KEY STATISTIC:

552
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,980
THE MAJORITY OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS

553
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,980
SAY THEY'LL VOTE IN PERSON ON

554
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,980
ELECTION DAY, WHILE THE MAJORITY

555
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,980
OF BIDEN SUPPORTERS SAY THEY'LL

556
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,980
VOTE BY MAIL.

557
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,980
SO IT'S CLEARLY VERY MUCH IN

558
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,980
TRUMP'S INTEREST TO TRY AND

559
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,980
DISCREDIT VOTING BY MAIL,

560
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,980
CLAIMING IT'S RIFE WITH FRAUD,

561
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,980
DESPITE THE FACT... AS STUDIES

562
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,980
AND COURT CASES HAVE REPEATEDLY

563
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,980
SHOWN... IT ISN'T.

564
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,980
AND IT'S NOT JUST TRUMP CLAIMING

565
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,980
THEY'RE ILLEGITIMATE, EVEN

566
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,940
BILL BARR, HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL,

567
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,000
HAS JOINED IN, SAYING SHIT LIKE

568
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,980
THIS.

569
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,980
WHEN... WHEN GOVERNMENT

570
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,980
GOVERNMENTS START ADOPTING THESE

571
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,980
PRACTICES LIKE MAIL-IN BALLOTS

572
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,980
THAT OPEN THE FLOODGATES OF

573
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,980
POTENTIAL FRAUD, THEN PEOPLE'S

574
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,980
CONFIDENCE IN THE OUTCOME OF THE

575
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,980
ELECTION IS GONNA BE UNDERMINED.

576
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,980
AND THAT COULD TAKE THE COUNTRY

577
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,980
TO A VERY DARK PLACE IF WE LOSE

578
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,980
CONFIDENCE IN THE OUTCOMES OF

579
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,980
OUR ELECTIONS.

580
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,980
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE

581
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,980
THE ONE UNDERMINING

582
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,980
OUR CONFIDENCE!

583
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,980
YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT THERE!

584
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,980
AND AS FOR THE NOTION THAT

585
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,980
"THIS COULD TAKE THE COUNTRY

586
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,980
TO A DARK PLACE?"

587
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,980
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE NOTICED,

588
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,980
BUT EVERYTHING WITHIN DRIVING

589
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,980
DISTANCE OF DISNEYLAND IS

590
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,980
COVERED IN SMOKE, THERE'S

591
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,980
A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT JUST

592
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,980
INFECTED THE PRESIDENT, AND

593
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,980
YOU'RE ON TELEVISION IN STUPID

594
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,980
WOODY ALLEN GLASSES CALLING

595
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,980
THE LEGITIMACY OF OUR DEMOCRACY

596
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,000
INTO QUESTION.

597
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,980
WE'RE IN THAT VERY DARK PLACE

598
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,980
ALREADY, BILLIAM.

599
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,980
TRUMP HIMSELF HAS GONE OUT OF

600
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,980
HIS WAY TO CLAIM THAT ALL MANNER

601
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,980
OF BALLOT FRAUD IS ALREADY

602
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,980
TAKING PLACE.

603
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,980
HE EVEN RATTLED OFF EXAMPLES

604
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,980
DURING TUESDAY'S DEBATE.

605
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,980
THEY'RE SENDING MILLIONS OF

606
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,980
BALLOTS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

607
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,980
THERE'S FRAUD.

608
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,980
THEY FOUND THEM IN CREEKS.

609
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,980
THEY FOUND SOME, JUST HAPPENED

610
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,980
TO HAVE THE NAME "TRUMP" JUST

611
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,976
THE OTHER DAY IN A WASTEPAPER

612
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,980
BASKET.
THEY'RE BEING SENT ALL OVER

613
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,980
THE PLACE.

614
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,976
THEY SENT TWO IN A DEMOCRAT

615
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,980
AREA. THEY SENT OUT A THOUSAND

616
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,980
BALLOTS.

617
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,980
EVERYBODY GOT TWO BALLOTS.

618
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,980
THIS IS GOING TO BE A FRAUD LIKE

619
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,980
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN.

620
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,580
OKAY, I KNOW THAT

621
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,980
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT, BUT... AS

622
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,980
YOU'VE PROBABLY GUESSED... THAT

623
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,980
WAS A 12-COURSE TASTING MENU

624
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,980
OF HORSESHIT.

625
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,980
BECAUSE HE IS WILDLY

626
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,700
MISREPRESENTING EVERY SINGLE

627
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,980
ONE OF THOSE CASES.

628
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,980
FIRST, ON THE BALLOTS IN THE

629
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,980
CREEK EXAMPLE, HE SEEMS TO

630
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,980
BE REFERRING TO REPORTS OF

631
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,980
A FEW ABSENTEE BALLOTS

632
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,980
IN WISCONSIN BEING FOUND

633
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,980
IN TRAYS OF MAIL THAT WERE FOUND

634
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,980
IN A DITCH.

635
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,980
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW, THE TRAYS

636
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,980
WERE FULL OF ALL SORTS OF MAIL,

637
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,980
AND STATE ELECTION OFFICIALS

638
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,980
LATER CLARIFIED THEY ACTUALLY

639
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,820
"DID NOT INCLUDE ANY WISCONSIN

640
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,980
BALLOTS" WHATSOEVER.

641
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,980
AS FOR THE WASTEPAPER BASKET

642
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,980
EXAMPLE, THAT WAS AN INCIDENT

643
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,980
WHERE A TEMP WORKER, WHO'D ONLY

644
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,980
WORKED AT THE COUNTY ELECTION

645
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,980
OFFICE FOR THREE DAYS,

646
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,980
MISTAKENLY DISCARDED NINE

647
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,980
BALLOTS, AND WHEN HIS BOSSES

648
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,980
REALIZED WHAT HE'D DONE,

649
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,980
THEY IMMEDIATELY REPORTED IT

650
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,980
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AT THE LOCAL,

651
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,980
STATE, AND FEDERAL LEVEL.

652
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,980
AND JUST SPARE A QUICK THOUGHT

653
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,980
FOR THAT TEMP.

654
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,980
IMAGINE IF SOME STUPID MISTAKE

655
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,980
YOU MADE AT WORK ENDED UP BEING

656
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,980
HELD UP AS EVIDENCE OF

657
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,980
A LEFT-WING CONSPIRACY AGAINST

658
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,980
THE PRESIDENT.

659
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,980
IMAGINE BUYING THE WRONG K-CUPS

660
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,980
FOR THE BREAK-ROOM AND NEXT

661
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,980
THING YOU KNOW, TUCKER CARLSON

662
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,976
IS ON TV SCREAMING ABOUT HOW

663
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,980
THE RADICAL LEFT IS
DECAFFEINATING THE SUBURBS.

664
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,980
AND FINALLY, AS FOR THOSE

665
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:57,980
THOUSAND EXTRA BALLOTS HE

666
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,880
MENTIONED... THAT WAS A FUCK UP

667
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,980
WHERE SOME VOTERS IN

668
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,980
FAIRFAX COUNTY, VIRGINIA,

669
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,980
WERE SENT TWO MAIL-IN BALLOTS

670
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,980
BY MISTAKE.

671
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,980
WHICH SOUNDS BAD, BUT THE KEY

672
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,980
THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT

673
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,980
BECAUSE BALLOTS ARE MATCHED TO

674
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,760
INDIVIDUAL VOTERS, THE SYSTEM

675
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,980
IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT PEOPLE

676
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,980
VOTING TWICE.

677
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,980
YOU MAY HAVE TWO BALLOTS,

678
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,980
BUT YOU CAN ONLY CAST ONE.

679
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,980
AND LOOK, MISTAKES ARE GOING TO

680
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,980
HAPPEN IN AN ELECTION WITH OVER

681
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,980
100 MILLION BALLOTS.

682
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,980
THEY SHOULDN'T, BUT THEY WILL.

683
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,980
AND WHEN THEY DO, WE SHOULD MOVE

684
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,980
FAST TO CORRECT THEM.

685
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,980
BUT NONE OF THOSE EXAMPLES TRUMP

686
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,980
CITED, ALL OF WHICH HAVE LIT UP

687
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,980
RIGHT-WING MEDIA, APPEAR TO

688
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,980
BE PART OF ANY SCHEME

689
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,980
TO STEAL VOTES.

690
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,980
AND IF THEY ARE, THE SCHEME

691
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,980
SEEMS TO BE HORRIBLY

692
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,980
COORDINATED,

693
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,980
TOTALLY NONSENSICAL, AND

694
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,980
EXTREMELY DUMB.

695
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,980
SO THE FACT IS THAT FEARS OVER

696
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,980
MAIL-IN BALLOT FRAUD HAVE BEEN

697
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,980
WILDLY OVERBLOWN.

698
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,980
AND TO THE EXTENT THERE IS ANY

699
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,980
DANGER WITH THEM, IT'S ACTUALLY

700
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,980
A FAR MORE MUNDANE ONE, AND

701
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,995
THAT'S THAT YOU COULD END UP
HAVING YOUR BALLOT REJECTED FOR

702
00:18:59,019 --> 00:18:59,980
TECHNICAL REASONS.

703
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,980
IN THE 2020 PRIMARIES,

704
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,980
MORE THAN 550,000 BALLOTS

705
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,980
WERE REJECTED IN 30 STATES

706
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,980
DUE TO MISSING SIGNATURES,

707
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,880
MISSED DEADLINES, OR SIGNATURES

708
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,980
THAT COULD NOT BE VERIFIED.

709
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,980
THINK ABOUT THAT...

710
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,640
OVER HALF A MILLION BALLOTS

711
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,980
WERE REJECTED IN THE PRIMARIES!

712
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,980
THAT'S PRACTICALLY AN ENTIRE

713
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,980
WYOMING DISAPPEARING

714
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,980
INTO THIN AIR.

715
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,980
THAT IS REALLY BAD, UNLESS IT'S

716
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,980
THE ACTUAL WYOMING DISAPPEARING,

717
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,980
IN WHICH CASE, IT MIGHT BE FOR

718
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,980
THE BEST.

719
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,980
IT'S A SEMI-ARID SANDBOX FILLED

720
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,980
WITH FLUFFY COWS AND NOTHING.

721
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,980
THE MOST FAMOUS PART OF WYOMING

722
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,980
IS THE STATE TRYING TO SWALLOW

723
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,980
ITSELF UP, AND THE SECOND MOST

724
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,980
FAMOUS PART IS IT SPITTING

725
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,980
ITSELF OUT AGAIN.

726
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,980
IT'S CLEAR THAT EVEN YOU DON'T

727
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,980
LIKE YOU, WYOMING, AND IT'S

728
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,980
GETTING HARD FOR THE REST OF US

729
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,980
TO WATCH.

730
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,980
AND TO BE FAIR TO VOTERS,

731
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,340
BALLOTS CAN BE TRICKY.

732
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,980
SOME STATES HAVE SECRECY

733
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,980
ENVELOPES, WHICH YOU DON'T SIGN,

734
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,980
WHICH YOU THEN HAVE TO PUT

735
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,980
INSIDE A DECLARATION ENVELOPE,

736
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,980
WHICH YOU DO.

737
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,976
IT CAN BE CONFUSING, SO MAKE

738
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,960
SURE YOU READ THE INSTRUCTIONS

739
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,980
CAREFULLY.

740
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,980
AND IT'S ALSO SURPRISINGLY

741
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,980
IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT

742
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,980
THE SIGNATURE THAT YOU'RE USING.

743
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,980
BECAUSE THEY MATCH THEM AGAINST

744
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,980
THE ONE THEY HAVE ON RECORD FOR

745
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,980
YOU, EITHER FROM WHEN YOU

746
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,980
REGISTERED TO VOTE, OR THE ONE

747
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,980
YOU HAVE ON FILE AT THE DMV.

748
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,980
AND REPLICATING YOUR OWN

749
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,980
SIGNATURE CAN BE MORE DIFFICULT

750
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,980
THAN YOU MIGHT EXPECT, AS THIS

751
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,980
HANDWRITING EXPERT EXPLAINS.

752
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,980
ORSINI SAYS NO TWO SIGNATURES

753
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,980
ARE IDENTICAL AND VARY OVER

754
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,980
TIME.

755
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,980
HAND SIZE AND AGE AND

756
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,980
ILLNESS, MEDICATION.

757
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,980
THE WRITING POSITION

758
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,980
THEY WERE IN.

759
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,980
WERE THEY DEPRESSED?

760
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,980
ALL OF THOSE KIND OF FACTORS

761
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,980
COME INTO PLAY.

762
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,980
LOOK AT THESE ACTUAL

763
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,980
SIGNATURES FROM FORMER PRESIDENT

764
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,980
RICHARD NIXON OVER A SIX-YEAR

765
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,980
PERIOD.

766
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,980
IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE

767
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:37,980
SAME PERSON.

768
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,976
EXACTLY.

769
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,980
BUT YET IT IS.
IT'S THE SAME SIGNATURE.

770
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,980
YEAH, THE TRUTH IS,

771
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,980
OUR SIGNATURES CHANGE OVER TIME.

772
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,980
AND SOMETIMES, OVER THE COURSE

773
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,980
OF A SINGLE DAY, BECAUSE LET'S

774
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,980
BE HONEST, WE ALL HAVE AT LEAST

775
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,980
TWO SIGNATURES... THE REAL ONE,

776
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,980
AND YOUR COFFEE SHOP SIGNATURE,

777
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,980
WHICH IS USUALLY JUST A LINE

778
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,980
AND, DEPENDING ON YOUR MOOD,

779
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,980
A COUPLE OF LOOP-DE-LOOPS.

780
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,976
LOOK, YOU'RE GETTING A MUFFIN,

781
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,980
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
CALLIGRAPH THE iPAD?

782
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,980
OF COURSE NOT.

783
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,980
IT'S YOUR POINTER FINGER,

784
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,980
IT'S NOT YOUR ART FINGER.

785
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,980
IT'S FOR POINTING.

786
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,980
AND IN THEORY, SOME STATES

787
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,980
ARE SUPPOSED TO LET YOU KNOW

788
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,980
IF YOUR BALLOT WAS DISQUALIFIED,

789
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,980
BUT IN PRACTICE,

790
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,980
THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN.

791
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,980
JUST WATCH ONE CALIFORNIA MAN

792
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,980
LEARN IT HAPPENED TO HIM

793
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,980
IN 2018.

794
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,980
TATTOO ARTIST JOHNNY TREVINO

795
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,980
LOVES TO CREATE.

796
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,980
GOOD TO GO.

797
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,980
DRAWING ON HUMAN SKIN.

798
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,980
LOOK AT HOW SMOOTH IT IS,

799
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,980
TOO.

800
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,980
THAT'S WHY TREVINO SAYS IT

801
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,980
CAME AS A SHOCK WHEN WE SHOWED

802
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,980
HIM THAT THE WAY HE DRAWS HIS

803
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,980
SIGNATURE ACTUALLY CAUSED HIS

804
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,000
BALLOT TO BE REJECTED DURING THE

805
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,980
LAST MAJOR ELECTION IN 2018.

806
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,980
THE REASON IS NO SIGNATURE

807
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,980
MATCH.

808
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,980
I WISH I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS.

809
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,980
DOES THAT FRUSTRATE YOU?

810
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,980
YES.

811
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,980
BECAUSE I'M A TATTOO ARTIST AND

812
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,980
SOMETIMES I WRITE IT BEAUTIFUL

813
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,980
AND SOMETIMES I JUST SIGN IT

814
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,980
QUICK.

815
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,980
AND I BET YOU A LOT OF PEOPLE DO

816
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,980
THAT.

817
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,980
OKAY, THAT IS

818
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,980
UNFORTUNATE TO FIND OUT.

819
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,980
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY,

820
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,980
"SOMETIMES I WRITE IT BEAUTIFUL

821
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,980
AND SOMETIMES I JUST SIGN IT

822
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,980
QUICK" IS ONE OF THE LAST THINGS

823
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,980
YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM SOMEONE

824
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,980
GIVING YOU A TATTOO.

825
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:56,980
IT'S RIGHT UP THERE WITH

826
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,980
"YOU KNOW, I'M MORE OF

827
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,980
A HANDS-FREE ARTIST."

828
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,980
BUT LOOK, LET'S SAY THAT NONE OF

829
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,980
WHAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT SO FAR

830
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,980
TURNS OUT TO BE A PROBLEM.

831
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,980
EVERYONE BEHAVES THEMSELVES AT

832
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,980
POLLING PLACES, THE LINES AREN'T

833
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,980
TOO LONG, AND NOBODY FUCKS UP

834
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,980
THEIR MAIL-IN BALLOT.

835
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,980
THERE IS STILL ONE MORE

836
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,980
POTENTIAL WRINKLE IN THIS

837
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,976
ELECTION, AND IT HAPPENS AFTER

838
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,976
YOU'VE VOTED.
BECAUSE MAIL-IN BALLOTS IN

839
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,980
PARTICULAR CAN TAKE A LONG TIME
TO COUNT.

840
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,980
WHICH DOES MAKE SENSE... IT'S

841
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,980
A LOGISTICAL NIGHTMARE.

842
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,980
BEFORE THE COUNT CAN BEGIN,

843
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,980
A SERIES OF PROCEDURES NEED TO

844
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,980
BE FOLLOWED... LIKE MAKING SURE

845
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,980
THE VOTE COUNT FROM A PARTICULAR

846
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,980
PRECINCT MATCHES UP WITH

847
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,980
THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF BALLOTS

848
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,980
RECEIVED.

849
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,980
THE CITY OF GRAND RAPIDS HAS

850
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,980
ISSUED SOME 35,000 ABSENTEE

851
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,980
BALLOTS.

852
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,980
JUST THE SIMPLE PROCESS OF

853
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,980
OPENING THAT MANY ENVELOPES,

854
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,980
THAT TAKES A LONG TIME.

855
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,976
YEAH, OF COURSE IT

856
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,980
DOES. 35,000 IS A SHIT-TON OF

857
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,980
ENVELOPES, AND OPENING THEM IS

858
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,980
GOING TO TAKE A LONG FUCKING

859
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,980
TIME.

860
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,980
WHICH, BY THE WAY, SHOULD

861
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,980
PROBABLY BE THE OFFICIAL TAGLINE

862
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,980
OF EVERY SINGLE AWARD SHOW:

863
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,980
THE OSCARS!

864
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,980
THERE ARE A SHIT TON OF

865
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,980
ENVELOPES TO OPEN, SO IT'S GONNA

866
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,980
TAKE A LONG FUCKING TIME!

867
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,980
SUNDAY, 8:00, 7:00 CENTRAL,

868
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,980
ON ABC.

869
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,000
AND MAKING IT WORSE, IN SOME

870
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,996
KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES, LIKE
PENNSYLVANIA AND WISCONSIN,

871
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,640
THEY'RE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO

872
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,980
BEGIN PROCESSING MAIL-IN BALLOTS

873
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,980
UNTIL ELECTION DAY ITSELF.

874
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,980
WHICH BRINGS US TO SOMETHING

875
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,980
VERY IMPORTANT.

876
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,980
BECAUSE THERE IS A NATURAL

877
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,980
VULNERABILITY HERE THAT

878
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,980
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN MAY BE ABLE

879
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,980
TO EXPLOIT IF WE'RE NOT

880
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,980
EXTREMELY CAREFUL.

881
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,980
REMEMBER, HE MAY RECEIVE

882
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,940
A LARGER PROPORTION OF IN-PERSON

883
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,980
VOTES, AND THOSE WILL GET

884
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,580
COUNTED FASTER, LEADING TO

885
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,980
A POTENTIAL PROBLEM.

886
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,980
ELECTION EXPERTS SAY ONE

887
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,980
POSSIBLE ELECTION SCENARIO IS

888
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,980
WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE BLUE SHIFT.

889
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,980
WITH TRUMP AHEAD ON ELECTION

890
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,980
NIGHT AND BIDEN PULLING IN FRONT

891
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,980
AFTER ELECTION NIGHT THROUGH

892
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,997
MAIL-IN BALLOTS.
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS

893
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:43,400
ELECTION NIGHT RESULTS.

894
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,980
THEY'RE ONLY PARTIAL RESULTS AND

895
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,997
THEY ALWAYS HAVE BEEN PARTIAL
RESULTS.

896
00:23:47,021 --> 00:23:48,980
EXACTLY.

897
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,980
MANY VOTES ARE COUNTED AFTER

898
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,980
ELECTION NIGHT.

899
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,980
AND THIS YEAR, THE DISCREPANCY

900
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,980
IN HOW PEOPLE VOTE COULD LEAD TO

901
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,980
A SO-CALLED "BLUE SHIFT," WHICH

902
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,980
I KNOW SOUNDS LIKE A EUPHEMISM

903
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,980
FOR A SMURF'S BOWEL MOVEMENT,

904
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,980
BUT IT ACTUALLY REFERS TO

905
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,980
THE IDEA THAT, SINCE MORE BIDEN

906
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,980
SUPPORTERS ARE VOTING BY MAIL,

907
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,980
DEMOCRATS COULD INITIALLY BE

908
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,980
BEHIND, THEN PULL AHEAD ONCE ALL

909
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,980
THE MAIL BALLOTS ARE COUNTED.

910
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,980
THE CONCERN IS THAT, IN THAT

911
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,980
EARLY STAGE, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN

912
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,980
COULD DECLARE VICTORY, AND CLAIM

913
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,980
ANY ADDITIONAL BALLOTS ARE

914
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,980
FRAUDULENT.

915
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,980
HE HIMSELF HAS TWEETED THAT WE

916
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,980
"MUST KNOW ELECTION RESULTS ON

917
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,976
THE NIGHT OF THE ELECTION,

918
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,980
NOT DAYS, MONTHS, OR EVEN
YEARS LATER."

919
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,980
WE DON'T

920
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,980
NEED TO KNOW ON THE NIGHT, AT

921
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,980
ALL.

922
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,980
PROJECTING WINNERS ON ELECTION

923
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,980
NIGHT CAN BE A BIT LIKE

924
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,980
SUMMARIZING "GET OUT" WHEN

925
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,980
YOU'VE ONLY SEEN THE BEGINNING:

926
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:35,980
IT'S ABOUT A YOUNG MAN WHO MEETS

927
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,980
HIS GIRLFRIEND'S PARENTS FOR THE

928
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,980
FIRST TIME, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY

929
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,980
NERVE-RACKING!

930
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,980
BUT LUCKILY, HER PARENTS SEEM

931
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,980
LIKE A COUPLE OF REAL SWEETIES,

932
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,980
SO EVERYTHING'S COOL!

933
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,980
YEAH, THAT'S HOW IT STARTS, BUT

934
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,980
MAYBE YOU SHOULD STOP TALKING

935
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,980
UNTIL YOU KNOW THE WHOLE STORY.

936
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,980
AND IN AN ELECTION WITH SO MANY

937
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,980
MAIL-IN VOTES, IT MAY TAKE

938
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,980
SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER TO GET

939
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,980
THE FINAL RESULTS THAN IT HAS IN

940
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,980
THE PAST, AND THE SWING COULD BE

941
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,980
EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED.

942
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,980
THAT IS WHY ELECTION OFFICIALS

943
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,980
ARE SO ANXIOUS TO RESET OUR

944
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,980
EXPECTATIONS.

945
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,980
THE EXPECTATION IS ELECTION

946
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,980
NIGHT, LIKE MOST ELECTION

947
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,980
NIGHTS, AROUND MIDNIGHT, 1:00,

948
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,980
WE KNOW WHO THE PRESIDENT IS

949
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,980
GOING TO BE.

950
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,880
AND IN 2020, THAT IS SIMPLY NOT

951
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,980
GOING TO BE THE CASE.

952
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,980
THE EXPECTATION SHOULD BE THAT

953
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,980
WE WILL PROBABLY NOT KNOW THE

954
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,980
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

955
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:23,980
UNTIL MID TO LATE NOVEMBER.

956
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,980
YEAH, IF THIS ELECTION

957
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,980
IS CLOSE, WE MAY NOT KNOW

958
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,980
FOR A WHILE.

959
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,995
SO IT MIGHT HELP TO STOP
THINKING OF IT AS

960
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:29,980
"ELECTION NIGHT" AND MORE AS AN

961
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,980
"ELECTION MONTH," WHICH IS A LOT

962
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,980
LIKE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS IT'S

963
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,980
THEIR "BIRTHDAY MONTH" IN THAT

964
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,980
THE VERY CONCEPT MAKES EVERY

965
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,980
DECENT AMERICAN WANT TO VOMIT.

966
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,980
AND THIS IS GOING TO TAKE AN

967
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,880
ADJUSTMENT ON EVERYBODY'S PART,

968
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,980
FROM INDIVIDUAL VOTERS,

969
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,980
TO TV NETWORKS THAT ARE

970
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,976
ACCUSTOMED TO GOING ALL-OUT

971
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,960
IN SELLING "ELECTION NIGHT"

972
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,980
AS AN EVENT.

973
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,976
TO SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKS THAT

974
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,980
COULD BECOME CESSPOOLS OF
MISINFORMATION.

975
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,980
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF PLACES

976
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,980
WHERE REPUBLICANS MIGHT BE ABLE

977
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,980
TO PUT THEIR THUMB ON THE SCALE

978
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,020
THIS ELECTION.

979
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,980
AND IF YOU THINK ANY OF THIS IS

980
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,980
ME BEING PARANOID, YOU SHOULD

981
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,980
KNOW, IT'S ALREADY STARTED.

982
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,997
IN WISCONSIN, REPUBLICAN
LEGISLATORS THREATENED TO SUE

983
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:04,980
ELECTIONS OFFICIALS FOR HOLDING

984
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,980
AN EARLY-VOTING EVENT WHERE

985
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,976
10,000 PEOPLE CAST BALLOTS,

986
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,960
SUGGESTING THEY MIGHT SEEK TO

987
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,980
HAVE ALL THOSE VOTES
INVALIDATED.

988
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,580
MEANWHILE, IN TEXAS, THEIR

989
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,980
GOVERNOR HAS INSISTED THAT

990
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,980
DROP-OFF LOCATIONS FOR ABSENTEE

991
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,980
BALLOTS BE LIMITED TO JUST ONE

992
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,980
PER COUNTY, WHETHER IT'S

993
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,980
LOVING COUNTY, WHICH HAS JUST

994
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,980
169 RESIDENTS, OR HARRIS COUNTY,

995
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,980
WHICH HAS MORE THAN

996
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,980
FOUR MILLION,

997
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,976
ALTHOUGH I GUESS THAT DOES TRACK

998
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,980
WITH TEXAS'S FAMOUS SLOGAN:
DON'T MESS WITH TEXAS, UNLESS

999
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,980
YOU'RE DIRECTING THEM TO A

1000
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,980
SINGLE VOTING NEXUS,

1001
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,980
EVEN WHILE SOME OF THEM COULD BE

1002
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:36,980
DANGEROUSLY INFECTIOUS.

1003
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:37,980
THAT SLOGAN NEVER MADE SENSE

1004
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,980
TO ME UNTIL JUST NOW.

1005
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,980
AND THIS BRINGS US TO OUR FINAL

1006
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:40,980
WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP

1007
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,980
THE SYSTEM RUN SMOOTHER?

1008
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,976
WELL, LUCKILY, THERE ARE STEPS

1009
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,780
YOU CAN TAKE.

1010
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,980
FIRST, AS AN INDIVIDUAL,
MAKE A PLAN TO VOTE.

1011
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,980
YOU CAN FIND INFORMATION FOR

1012
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,980
YOUR STATE AT CanlVote.org.

1013
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,980
IF YOU WANT TO DO IT IN-PERSON,

1014
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,980
ON ELECTION DAY, THAT'S GREAT.

1015
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,980
ALTHOUGH WE DON'T WANT EVERYONE

1016
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,980
DOING THAT, BECAUSE REMEMBER:

1017
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,980
WITH FEWER POLLING PLACES OPEN

1018
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,880
THIS YEAR, THAT COULD LEAD TO A

1019
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,980
"RUN THE JEWELS" LISTENING PARTY

1020
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,980
THAT NOBODY WANTS.

1021
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,980
SO IF YOUR SCHEDULE IS FLEXIBLE

1022
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,980
ENOUGH, AND YOU LIVE IN A STATE

1023
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:05,980
WHERE YOU CAN VOTE EARLY, YOU

1024
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,980
SHOULD DO THAT, ESPECIALLY TO

1025
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,980
MAKE THE LINES SHORTER ON

1026
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,980
ELECTION DAY FOR THOSE WHO DON'T

1027
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:09,980
HAVE THAT LUXURY.

1028
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,980
NOW IF YOU WANT TO VOTE BY

1029
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,980
MAIL, THAT'S GREAT, TOO.

1030
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,980
BUT WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO

1031
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,980
FLATTEN THE VOTING CURVE TO TAKE

1032
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,980
THE PRESSURE OFF THE SYSTEM.

1033
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,980
SO REQUEST YOUR BALLOT AS EARLY

1034
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,980
AS POSSIBLE, READ ALL THE

1035
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,980
INSTRUCTIONS, AND SEND IT BACK,

1036
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,980
OR DROP IT OFF, AS SOON AS

1037
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,980
YOU'VE FILLED IT IN.

1038
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,980
OH, AND ALSO, DO BE CAREFUL WITH

1039
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,980
YOUR SIGNATURE, UNLESS YOU WANT

1040
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,980
SOME LOCAL NEWS REPORTER TO SHOW

1041
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,980
UP TWO YEARS FROM NOW AND TELL

1042
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,980
YOU YOUR VOTE DIDN'T COUNT AND

1043
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,980
THROW YOUR SKILLS AS A TATTOO

1044
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,980
ARTIST INTO SIGNIFICANT DOUBT.

1045
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,980
AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU'RE STILL

1046
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,980
WORRIED ABOUT MAILING YOUR

1047
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,980
BALLOT IN, IT IS WORTH KNOWING

1048
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,980
46 STATES HAVE SOME FORM OF

1049
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,980
BALLOT TRACKING, SO YOU CAN

1050
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,980
BE SURE IT WAS RECEIVED AND

1051
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,980
COUNTED.

1052
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,980
AND YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY USE

1053
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,980
THAT RESOURCE IF YOU CAN.

1054
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,980
THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO

1055
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,980
REMEMBER IS, THIS ELECTION IS

1056
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,980
ALREADY VERY DIFFERENT FROM ALL

1057
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,980
THOSE BEFORE IT.

1058
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,980
SO WE ALL NEED TO BE ON TOP OF

1059
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,980
NOT ONLY OUR OWN VOTING PLANS,

1060
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,980
BUT MAKING SURE OUR FRIENDS AND

1061
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,980
FAMILY ARE ON TOP OF THEIRS AS

1062
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,980
WELL.

1063
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,980
BECAUSE I HAVE TO SAY, IF YOUR

1064
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,980
PLAN IS TO JUST SIT BACK AND

1065
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,980
EXPECT THE SYSTEM TO MAGICALLY

1066
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:06,980
WORK ITSELF OUT, AND THAT THIS

1067
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,980
MAN WILL HAVE A THREE-QUARTER

1068
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,980
LIFE CRISIS AND SUDDENLY TURN

1069
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,980
INTO A "GOOD LOSER," I'M SORRY

1070
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,980
TO SAY, BUT THAT'S SIMPLY A

1071
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,980
BAD IDEA!

1072
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,976
IT REALLY IS.

1073
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,840
AND NOW, THIS.

1074
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,980
AND NOW...

1075
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,997
PEOPLE MISS A LOT OF THINGS DUE
TO THE PANDEMIC.

1076
00:28:26,021 --> 00:28:27,980
THERE IS NOTHING LIKE GOING

1077
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,940
TO AN IRISH PUB IN NEW YORK CITY

1078
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,976
AND HAVING A PINT OF GUINNESS.

1079
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,960
THAT'S WHEN I MESS.

1080
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,976
ONE THING I MISS IS OPENING

1081
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,980
CANDLES AND JUST SMELLING.
BUT NOW THAT I AM SO...

1082
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,976
PRACTICALLY PARANOID ABOUT

1083
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,980
TOUCHING SERVICES, I'M NOT GOING
TO TOUCH ANYTHING I DON'T BUY.

1084
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,980
I MISS HUGGING, I AM A HUGGER

1085
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:46,980
AND I MISS HUGGING.

1086
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,976
I HUGGED SOME TREES IN MY

1087
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,980
YARD.
THAT IS HOW DESPERATE I GOT.

1088
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,976
I MISS THE CENTRAL PARK

1089
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,980
ZOO'S.
I MISS DISNEYLAND SO MUCH.

1090
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,980
I MISS MY VANILLA LATTE.

1091
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,980
I MISS MISS PIGGY.

1092
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,980
THE THINGS I MISS THE MOST

1093
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,976
ABOUT BEING WITH MY GIRLFRIEND'S

1094
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,477
BRUNCH!

1095
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:04,820
FACE-TO-FACE CONVERSATIONS.

1096
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,980
YOU JUST DON'T HAVE THEM.

1097
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,980
I AM RIGHT HERE.

1098
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,996
I KNOW YOU ARE RIGHT THERE.

1099
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,980
YOU KNOW WHAT A MESS?

1100
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,980
LICKING MY FINGERS.

1101
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,980
LICKING MY FINGERS.

1102
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,980
MOVING ON.

1103
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,980
FINALLY TONIGHT, A QUICK WORD

1104
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,980
ABOUT MUSEUMS.

1105
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,980
THINK OF THEM AS HISTORY'S

1106
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,980
INSTAGRAM.

1107
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:24,980
IF THIS WAS POSTED IN 2020, IT

1108
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,980
WOULDN'T BE CALLED "LUNCHEON OF

1109
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:26,980
THE BOATING PARTY," IT'D BE

1110
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,980
CALLED "BRUNCH TIME WITH

1111
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,976
MY BEST BAEs.

1112
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,960
#SunsOutGunsOut.

1113
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,980
#OilOnCanvas."

1114
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,980
LIKE MOST INDUSTRIES, MUSEUMS

1115
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,980
HAVE TAKEN A HUGE HIT DURING

1116
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,980
THE PANDEMIC, AND SOME HAVE HAD

1117
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,980
TO GET IMAGINATIVE ABOUT WAYS

1118
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,980
TO RAISE REVENUE AND ATTENTION,

1119
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,980
FROM LIVE-STREAMING GALAS,

1120
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,980
TO OFFERING FREE DOWNLOADS OF

1121
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,980
ARTWORK TO PLAYERS OF

1122
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,980
ANIMAL CROSSING, TO THIS.

1123
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,980
THE PENGUINS FROM THE ZOO

1124
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,980
GOT OUT AND WADDLED AROUND,

1125
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,980
ENJOYING A MORNING OF FINE ART

1126
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,980
AND CULTURE AT

1127
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,980
THE NELSON ATKINS' MUSEUM

1128
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,980
IN KANSAS CITY.

1129
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,980
THE ANIMALS TAKING A FIELD

1130
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:53,980
TRIP... LOOK AT THAT AWESOME

1131
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,980
SHOT... TO THE MUSEUM WHILE

1132
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,980
IT'S CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC.

1133
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,980
AND APPARENTLY, THEY HAD SOME

1134
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,980
VERY STRONG OPINIONS.

1135
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,980
THEY SEEMED TO REACT MUCH

1136
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,976
BETTER TO CARAVAGGIO THAN TO

1137
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,500
MONET.

1138
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,980
WELL, OF COURSE THEY

1139
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:07,980
DID.

1140
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,980
PENGUINS ARE AQUATIC FLIGHTLESS

1141
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,980
BIRDS, NOT COMPLETE PHILISTINES.

1142
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,980
EVEN THEY CAN APPRECIATE

1143
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,980
THAT CARAVAGGIO'S USE OF LIGHT

1144
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,976
REMAINS UNPARALLELED

1145
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,980
TO THIS DAY.
THE MAN PRACTICALLY INVENTED

1146
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,980
CHIAROSCURO.

1147
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,980
WHEREAS MONET IS AT THIS POINT

1148
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,980
REALLY MORE A POP CULTURE

1149
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,980
FIGURE.

1150
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,980
I MEAN, WHAT DID HE REALLY DO

1151
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,980
OTHER THAN VOMIT PASTELS AND

1152
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,976
GIVE UNIMAGINATIVE DUMB DUMBS

1153
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,980
SOMETHING PRETTY TO HANG IN
THEIR POWDER ROOMS?

1154
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,980
LISTEN, I DON'T THINK THAT.

1155
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,980
PENGUINS DO.

1156
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:31,980
BUT THE TRUTH IS, FOR MANY

1157
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,980
BELOVED INSTITUTIONS, IT'S JUST

1158
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,980
NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH.

1159
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,980
MOST MUSEUMS GET 50% OF THEIR

1160
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,980
OPERATING BUDGETS FROM EARNED

1161
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,980
SOURCES.

1162
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,980
SO FROM TICKET SALES, SPECIAL

1163
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,980
PROGRAMMING, AND PURCHASES OF

1164
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,980
TICKETS TO THOSE THINGS.

1165
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,980
ACCORDING TO A STUDY

1166
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,980
CONDUCTED BY THE AMERICAN

1167
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,980
ALLIANCE OF MUSEUMS, ONE-THIRD

1168
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,980
OF MUSEUMS MAY PERMANENTLY CLOSE

1169
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,980
IN THE NEXT YEAR.

1170
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,980
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

1171
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,580
MUSEUMS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

1172
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,980
LASTING MONUMENTS TO SCIENTIFIC,

1173
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,980
CULTURAL, AND ARTISTIC INTEREST,

1174
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,980
NOT BE AS DISPOSABLE AS

1175
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,980
THE FOURTH H&M IN TIMES SQUARE.

1176
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,980
THINGS ARE SO BAD,

1177
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,980
THE ASSOCIATION OF ART MUSEUM

1178
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,980
DIRECTORS RECENTLY RELAXED THEIR

1179
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,980
GUIDELINES, ALLOWING MUSEUMS TO

1180
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,980
SELL OFF PIECES OF ART IN ORDER

1181
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,980
TO HELP MAKE ENDS MEET.

1182
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,980
THE BROOKLYN MUSEUM HAS ALREADY

1183
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,980
STARTED DOING THAT.

1184
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,980
AND IT'S NOT JUST MAJOR

1185
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,980
INSTITUTIONS.

1186
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,980
THERE ARE TINY MUSEUMS ACROSS

1187
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:24,980
THIS COUNTRY THAT ARE REALLY

1188
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,980
STRUGGLING.

1189
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,980
AND THIS IS WHERE WE MAY

1190
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,980
ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO HELP.

1191
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,980
BECAUSE WE'VE DABBLED A BIT IN

1192
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,980
THE ART MARKET THIS YEAR, AND

1193
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,980
HAVE ACQUIRED A SMALL, BUT HIGH

1194
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,980
QUALITY COLLECTION OF MODERN

1195
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,980
MASTERPIECES.

1196
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,980
YOU MAY REMEMBER "STAY UP LATE"

1197
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,980
BY BRIAN SWORDS OF YORK.

1198
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,980
IT'S A MEDITATIVE PIECE

1199
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:38,980
DEPICTING TWO RATS IN

1200
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,980
A POST-COITAL EMBRACE.

1201
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,400
IN TERMS OF IMPORTANCE,

1202
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,980
IT'S VERY MUCH THE MONA LISA OF

1203
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,980
OUR COLLECTION, AND SWORDS THE

1204
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,980
DA VINCI.

1205
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,980
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

1206
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,980
WE ALSO ACQUIRED "TIES" BY

1207
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,980
JUDITH KUDLOW, A MULTICHROMATIC

1208
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,980
INSTALLMENT OF HER CAREER-LONG

1209
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,980
EXPLORATION OF A WORLD WITHOUT

1210
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,980
HER HUSBAND, LARRY.

1211
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,980
AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A THIRD

1212
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,980
PIECE WE'VE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE

1213
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,980
TO SHOW YOU YET.

1214
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,980
AND BEFORE I SHOW YOU, A LITTLE

1215
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:03,980
BACKGROUND.

1216
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,995
YOU MAY REMEMBER BACK, SAY,
400 YEARS AGO OR SO, WE DID

1217
00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:06,980
A SEGMENT ON WENDY WILLIAMS'S

1218
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,980
MAGNIFICENT LOCKDOWN VERSION

1219
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,980
OF HER TALK SHOW, WHERE WE

1220
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,980
COMPLIMENTED HER EATING MANY

1221
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,980
WEIRD FOODSTUFFS DURING HER

1222
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,980
BROADCAST.

1223
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,980
WE EVEN FOUND AND SENT HER

1224
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:17,980
A SWEATSUIT SHE WAS LOOKING FOR.

1225
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,980
AND SHORTLY AFTER, WE RECEIVED

1226
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,980
A NOTE FROM HER SHOW SAYING

1227
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,980
THEY'D... AND I QUOTE... "LIKE

1228
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,980
TO GIFT JOHN WITH A VERY ELEGANT

1229
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:26,980
PAINTING OF WENDY EATING

1230
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,980
A LAMB CHOP."

1231
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,980
AND GUESS WHAT?

1232
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,980
WE RECEIVED IT, AND IF THIS

1233
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,980
ISN'T A VERY ELEGANT PAINTING

1234
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,980
OF WENDY EATING A LAMB CHOP,

1235
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,980
I SIMPLY DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

1236
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,980
LOOK, IN MOMENTS OF SUFFERING,

1237
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,980
HUMANITY HAS, TIME AND AGAIN,

1238
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,980
FOUND SOLACE IN THE ARTS.

1239
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,980
SO TONIGHT, I'M PROUD TO

1240
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,980
ANNOUNCE THAT THIS COLLECTION IS

1241
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,980
AVAILABLE TO GO ON TOUR.

1242
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,980
THAT IS RIGHT.

1243
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,980
WE'RE INVITING ANY U.S. MUSEUM

1244
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,980
...AS LONG AS THEY CAN SAFELY

1245
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,980
SHOW THEM... TO APPLY TO HOST

1246
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,980
THESE MASTERPIECES.

1247
00:32:59,020 --> 00:32:59,980
WE WILL SEND THEM TO YOU, ALONG

1248
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,980
WITH A $10,000 DONATION, PLUS

1249
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,980
ANOTHER $10,000 DONATION

1250
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,980
TO A FOOD BANK IN YOUR AREA.

1251
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,980
WE'LL BE PICKING FIVE MUSEUMS

1252
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,980
TO GET THEM FOR TWO WEEKS

1253
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,980
APIECE, AND IF YOU WANT TO

1254
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,980
TAKE PART, YOU CAN EMAIL

1255
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,000

1257
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,980
AND IF SELECTED, SOON, YOU TOO

1258
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,980
WILL BE ABLE TO FEAST YOUR EYES

1259
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,980
UPON TRUE ART, LIKE WENDY IS

1260
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,980
FEASTING UPON THAT LAMB CHOP.

1261
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,997
YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.
I PROMISE.

1262
00:33:29,021 --> 00:33:32,980
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

1263
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,980
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

1264
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,976
